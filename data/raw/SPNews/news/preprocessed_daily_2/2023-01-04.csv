It is worth considering The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry.When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.68%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, The Charles Schwab Corporation was expected to post earnings of $1.05 per share, but it reported $1.10 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.76%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.91 per share, while it actually produced $0.97 per share, a surprise of 6.59%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for The Charles Schwab Corporation lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.The Charles Schwab Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +2.26% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Texas Instruments is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.46 = US$11b ÷ (US$26b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 46%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceIn the above chart we have measured Texas Instruments' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIt's hard not to be impressed by Texas Instruments' returns on capital. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 46% and the business has deployed 56% more capital into its operations. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.In Conclusion...In the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOne more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with Texas Instruments (at least 2 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Nucor Steel Brandenburg will focus on final commissioning of the mill in the first quarter of 2023 and will ship the first tons to customers during the quarter.""Congratulations to our more than 400 teammates for achieving this important milestone and executing one of the safest mill start-ups in Nucor history, while also delivering the project on time and on budget,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""We are looking forward to supplying not only the highest quality steel but also the most sustainable plate products in the world for our nation's military, infrastructure, heavy equipment, offshore wind, and other markets.""Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be among only a few mills globally - and the only mill in the United States - capable of manufacturing at scale the heavy gauge plate used in monopile foundations for offshore wind towers. As a result, it will be a critical part of the supply chain for the continued development of our nation's offshore wind power infrastructure. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $300 billion for clean energy development and climate programs, supports the Biden Administration's announced goal to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030. This could result in approximately 7.5 million tons of additional steel demand.The Nucor Steel Brandenburg plate mill is a $1.7 billion capital investment in specialized capabilities with the ability to produce 1.2 million tons annually. The new mill is located in the middle of the largest steel plate-consuming region in the country and will be able to produce 97% of plate products consumed domestically. It is also the first steel mill in the world to pursue certification under LEED v4 (""Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design""), which is more stringent than previous LEED rating systems and provides a globally recognized framework for sustainability achievement.Story continues""We would like to thank the Governor's Office, officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, and local officials in Brandenburg and Meade County for their incredible support of this project from start to finish,"" said Johnny Jacobs, Vice President and General Manager of Nucor Steel Brandenburg.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Now.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, meaning that demand for semiconductor products fluctuates in regular intervals. This is due to the fact that semiconductor products are closely tied to the broader technology industry, which also experiences cyclicality. Demand for semiconductor products tends to rise when the overall economy is doing well, as businesses and consumers purchase more technology products. On the other hand, when the economy is in a recession, semiconductor demand tends to fall.The semiconductor industry has had its fair share of volatility. First was a global shortage amid the Covid-19 pandemic, triggered by increased consumer spending on personal computers and devices as consumers were forced to stay indoors. The shortage turned into a glut as manufacturers hoarded chips, we did a piece about this. You can go to 10 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch as Shortage Turns to Glut if you want to read about that.Global Semiconductor Revenue to Go Down by 3.6% in 2023According to a report by Gartner, the worldwide semiconductor revenue is on track to go down by 3.6% in 2023 and amount to $596 billion, down from $618 billion in 2022. The Vice President of Gartner, Richard Gordon, said:“The short-term outlook for semiconductor revenue has worsened. Rapid deterioration in the global economy and weakening consumer demand will negatively impact the semiconductor market in 2023.”Moreover, memory revenue is expected to decline by 16.2% in 2023. This is driven by demand destruction for PCs, smartphones, and consumer electronics, and an oversupply of chips in these markets.Wedbush Analyst Bullish on Semiconductor StocksOn December 23, Wedbush Securities' analyst, Matt Bryson, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network where he gave his take on the situation of the semiconductor sector and what he sees for the space moving forward. According to Matt Bryson, semiconductor companies' margins have suffered because ""there's too much inventory out there, there's still too much supply, and this is what happens when there's not enough demand"". However, Matt Bryson sees an uptick in semiconductor performance soon. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues""The last three, four years, we've seen these mini cycles where you really haven't seen substantial oversupply or substantial undersupply and so earning and margins have held within a relatively narrow range, at least in the history of memory. This looks a lot more like the cycles we saw prior to the last three, four years, where you get substantial oversupply. What ends up happening is the memory companies over correct and so they reduce production, reduce forward Capex and forward production capacity, and then a couple of things happen. One, demand for memory continues to grow, while I believe will happen this time around. Two, as pricing comes down, because the product is cheaper, you see content per device go up. So, PCs start using more memory, servers start using more memory. That's always a little bit unexpected, and what ends up happening is, in some period of time, you end up with not enough supply. And so we see the exact reverse happen of the downtick we just saw. You get an uptrend in pricing, it all flows through into revenue and margins, and all of a sudden earnings look really good.""2022 has been a bad year for stocks, especially growth stocks which include semiconductor stocks. As of January 3, the Nasdaq Composite has shed over a third of its value since the beginning of 2022. However, this massive pullback has caused certain leading names in the semiconductor space to drop to bargain levels.

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.36%.For the most recent quarter, U.S. Bancorp was expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, but it reported $1.18 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.07 per share, while it actually produced $1.09 per share, a surprise of 1.87%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for U.S. Bancorp. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.U.S. Bancorp currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.28%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 25, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpThe insider, Timothy Welsh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$43.61. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in U.S. Bancorp didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like U.S. Bancorp better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At U.S. Bancorp Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of U.S. Bancorp shares. In total, insiders sold US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. U.S. Bancorp insiders own about US$109m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with U.S. Bancorp and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

15,84260fe9-cc60-3f39-967d-64af5f03bc67,CF,2023-01-04,"Investors Heavily Search CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cf-industries-140002300.html,1672754402,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -17.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which CF falls in, has lost 13.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, CF is expected to post earnings of $4.26 per share, indicating a change of +14.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +276.9%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.09 indicates a change of -5.6% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.86 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.5%. The $11.44 billion and $9.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +74.9% and -14.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now separated from Flipkart and re-domiciled from Singapore to India, the fintech firm is raising funds at a $12 billion pre-money valuation from General Atlantic, Qatar Investment Authority and others, triggering the hefty charge, the people said, declining to be named discussing a private matter.Investors including Tiger Global Management have now purchased shares of PhonePe in India at the new price, leading to tax implications of roughly 80 billion rupees for existing shareholders, one of the people said.Representatives of Walmart, Flipkart and Tiger Global did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. A PhonePe spokeswoman declined to comment.PhonePe is shifting its headquarters to Bangalore, similar to online retailer and former parent company Flipkart. It’s an unusual step for an Indian startup to move home. For years, technology companies with the bulk of their operations and business in India have chosen to incorporate in Singapore because of the friendlier tax regime, ease of getting foreign investments and simpler processes for public debuts on foreign exchanges.Over 8,000 Indian startups have incorporated in Singapore since the year 2000, according to a report by India Briefing. PhonePe’s three major moves — relocating to India, carving itself out as a separate entity from Flipkart and raising funds at a high valuation — come at a time when startup firms around the world are struggling to raise funds and facing deflating valuations.Story continuesPhonePe’s shift could be a precursor to the digital payments company preparing for a stock market listing in India. Any payments firm listed overseas would struggle to get a green light from India’s financial and banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, one of the people said. The government currently forbids India-headquartered companies from directly listing on overseas exchanges.India has over 26,000 startups making it the world’s third-largest startup ecosystem according to the Asian Development Bank, and at last count over 100 of these were valued at $1 billion, making them unicorns.(Updates with data on Indian startup ecosystem in final paragraph; an earlier version corrected mention of Tiger Global as a new investor)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Aggressive Chip Strategy Forces China Into a CornerThe World’s Love Affair With Japanese Cars Is SouringSilicon Valley Can’t Quit Its Pizza Robot ObsessionWho Owns the Content AI Creates?It Takes 6,000 Gallons of Water to Cool the World’s Fastest Supercomputer©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

One has to just take a look at the luxury sector for evidence.Sales at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — parent company of the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Tiffany &amp; Co., among others — soared 19 percent to 19.76 billion euros last quarter. German luxury e-commerce site Mytheresa had double-digit growth in its fourth quarter. While Farfetch lost money in its most recent quarter after pulling out of Russia and because of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in China, the luxury e-tailer’s top-line revenues grew more than 14 percent, year-over-year.More from WWDYear of Rabbit Chinese New Year CampaignsLouis Vuitton Spring 2023 Men's Spin-off in Aranya, ChinaSpring 2023: A Whirlwind Fashion Week in New York“Luxury is a very resilient industry. It will continue to be resilient, more than any other industry, certainly in fashion,” José Neves, Farfetch’s founder, chairman and chief executive officer, told WWD last year. “People are not going from Hermès to H&amp;M. You’re not going to go to a dinner party, or a wedding, or a social event with last season’s dresses if you love fashion, if you’re into this part of culture.“And for the high-net-worth family, these are not big-ticket items,” he continued. “That’s not where they cut their spending from.”On the other side of the spectrum, budget-conscious shoppers are pulling back on discretionary items. In other cases, consumers are spending any extra money they have on experiences over tangible products.But will this trend persist into the new year as inflation shows no signs of slowing down and fears of a recession continue to loom?The effects of this split are clearly visible at a company like Urban Outfitters Inc., which counts Urban Outfitters, the Anthropologie Group, Free People, Terrain and Bhldn among its brands. While the slightly pricier Anthropologie and Free People brands continued to make gains (even as consumer prices rise), sales at the nameplate brand fell 9 percent during the pre-holiday season.Story continues“Customer shopping at our brands has bifurcated,” Richard A. Hayne, CEO of Urban Outfitters Inc., told analysts during a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings last fall. “For the Urban brand customer, who is younger and less affluent, the current inflation is economically crippling.”Retailers, like consumers, are also struggling to keep up with rising prices in the form of elevated freight and shipping costs, employee wages and energy costs. There’s also the problem of inventory, which is expensive to store and has led to an increasingly promotional environment as firms try to unload an excess of goods.The mass channel, meanwhile, has a few advantages over specialty retail, even in the face of inflation. Namely, big-box stores sell essentials and food. In the last few quarters, Walmart has reaped the benefits of its essential status thanks to its massive grocery business. While Target has made some gains from its growing beauty and food businesses, the retailer’s greater mix of discretionary items — and rapidly changing consumers habits — has led to steep declines in profits.But just how long the boom in travel and consumer desire to splurge on experiences will last is unclear. And higher prices means consumers are more inclined (even high-income individuals) to shop at discount stores in the midst of runaway inflation. That’s the case at Walmart, which improved on top-line sales last fall, in part because of a greater number of affluent consumers flocking to the mass channel in search of discounts.“We’ve continued to gain grocery market share from households across income demographics, with nearly three-quarters of the share gain coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income,” John David Rainey, Walmart’s chief financial officer, said during November’s conference call.Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, added: “Regardless of income, families are more price conscious now. Living with higher prices this year has had a cumulative impact on our customers.”]"

The warehouse club hiked its Gold Star membership fee by $5 to $60 a year and its Executive membership fee by $10 to $120.According to Heinbockel's analysis, Costco stock rose 11% on average three months prior to the last three membership fee increases in 2006, 2011, and 2017. The stock gained 15% on average six months prior to each announcement.And rival warehouse retailer Sam's Club, a division of Walmart (WMT), enacted a membership fee increase in Sept. 2022, which could provide Costco cover to lift its own prices.But Costco execs have pushed back consistently on the fee increase — even at the expense of upsetting Wall Street — citing that's not good for inflation-ravaged consumers.Costco CFO Richard Galanti told Yahoo Finance in December the retailer isn't ready to raise the cost of its membership. Galanti stated that the company will clearly outline any fee increases to Wall Street if and when the time comes.With Costco pushing back on the membership fee hike, shares have traded on slowing sales growth at the warehouse king and the potential for that trend to continue in 2023 amid a sluggish economy.Consumers apply for Costco membership at the Costco Wholesale store in Glendale, California, on Monday, Feb. 28, 2011. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)Costco didn't have a perfect November. The company reported on Nov. 30 that same-store sales growth cooled versus October, and the Street wasn't super hot on Costco's earnings when they hit on Dec. 8, either.Shares are down about 8.6% in the past month versus a 6.4% drop for the S&amp;P 500.Meanwhile, the company is slated to reveal key December sales results later this week.Story continues""Based on our conversations with investors, this incorporates another below-trendline comparable sales result as well as below-consensus second quarter earnings in early March,"" Heinbockel added. ""This lower bar would cushion the impact of any near-term shortfalls with modest likely incremental weakness, perhaps no more than 5%, despite a 17x 2023E EBITDA multiple, still one of the highest in large-cap retail.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walmart (WMT).Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in WMT?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.08.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Win Strategy focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan changes to drive organic growth. Accretive pricing and supply-chain management actions are also providing significant relief to the companyParker-Hannifin’s ability to penetrate different markets through acquisitions is commendable.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES, Marathon Petroleum MPC, ExxonMobil XOM and Schlumberger SLB.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will These 5 Energy Stocks See Another Bull Run in 2023?The year 2022 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in what was its worst performance in more than a decade. With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight the persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s steepest annual loss since 2008, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with commodity prices soaring to new highs and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the year. The standout performers of 2022 were Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Energy Outperforms Amid CarnageAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the year deep in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while all others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index continued to move higher last year after comfortably topping the S&amp;P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It generated a total return of 58% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7%.Story continuesThe energy market continued to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union putting a price cap on Russian oil exports — even at the cost of their economies — the oil bulls have got a fresh impetus.While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the market’s precariously low level of spare capacity, China’s emergence from its strict COVID-19 restrictions, a stretched-out refining system, plus the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in 2022 and gained approximately 20% last year despite a steep selloff at the end of unseasonal warm weather projections for January. But overall, the commodity’s performance in 2022 was driven by a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat in the United States, high demand in Europe (as the continent reduces its dependence on Russian gas) and strong LNG shipments.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in 2022, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the yearly sectoral gains were Occidental Petroleum, Hess, Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Will these winners maintain their run in 2023 too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.This stock handily outperformed all other companies and was up 117.3% during the period, ranking first on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Occidental continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and benefit from the acquisition of Anadarko, the American multinational might have run out of steam. In particular, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company‘s massive long-term debt of more than $20 billion and exposure to volatile commodity prices could limit further share price gains.Hess Corporation: Hess is a leading global integrated energy company. The company’s E&amp;P activities are concentrated in Denmark, Guyana, Canada, Suriname, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and the United States. Additionally, Hess provides gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs.Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 91.6% last year. Its slew of discoveries in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, is a big positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Guyana is expected to become one of HES’ major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the energy operator’s rising costs and expenses, in addition to its relatively high debt-to-capitalization of 50.9%, can affect its financial flexibility. Finally, the dividend yield of Hess compares unfavorably to most of its peers and the S&amp;P 500.Marathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 81.9% in the past year. MPC’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement, per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the COVID lows, the continued increase in costs over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential for #3 Ranked MPC.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. XOM is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production, to refining and marketing.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 80.3% higher in the last twelve months. ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. With steadily increasing cash flows, XOM recently said that it will now buy back $50 billion of stock through 2024.However, the energy giant’s above-average capital spending program has got investors concerned. Also, the integrated energy major has been witnessing lower oil equivalent production volumes, which might affect the bottom line.Schlumberger: Schlumberger is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ended 78.5% higher in the January-December period. High commodity prices have increased demand for its services in energy markets across the globe. Schlumberger's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength, while its healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well.Additionally, its disciplined capital spending will likely benefit shareholders over the long term. While macro headwinds could still impact SLB’s EPS growth In 2023, it’s still a good investment for those interested in the energy market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Both contracts plummeted over 4% each on Tuesday.A sharp recovery in the dollar also weighed on crude prices, with the dollar index surging more than 1% on Tuesday as traders positioned for the minutes of the Fed’s December meeting, due to be released later on Wednesday.Focus will be on whether policymakers support a further slowing in interest rate hikes, following an increasing number of signs that U.S. inflation has likely peaked. But given that inflation is still trending well above the Fed’s target range, markets remained on edge.A slew of U.S. data this week is also expected to shed more light on the world’s largest oil consumer, starting with manufacturing activity data for December due later in the day. Nonfarm payrolls data for December, due on Friday, is also expected to provide more insight into the jobs market.Traders fear that a sustained rise in U.S. interest rates could weigh on economic activity and potentially trigger a recession in 2023- a scenario that is negative for crude demand. The prospect of a recession triggered wild swings in oil prices through 2022, and is expected to cause more volatility in the near-term.Concerns over a delayed economic recovery in China were also heightened after President Xi Jinping struck a more cautious tone than expected during his new year's address. The country is grappling with an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases after it relaxed several restrictions in December.Story continuesAnalysts warned that rising infections in the country are likely to delay an economic reopening, and could potentially damage the Chinese economy even further in the near-term.

Investors will parse the minutes to figure out whether more policy tightening is likely, as well as scanning U.S. job openings data at 1500 GMT.""The market has made a pretty tentative start to the year ... (and) is still grappling with the notion of what we are going to see from the Fed this year,"" said Rob Carnell, head of ING's Asia-Pacific research.""There are two camps out there and they are wrestling for dominance in terms of the view. Some days higher-for-longer wins, some days (the) higher-then-lower camp wins,"" Carnell said.U.S. shares, which have started the year more tentatively amid big falls in key stocks such as Tesla, looked set to open with modest gains. E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.44%.The U.S. central bank said last month when it raised interest rates by 50 basis points that the terminal rates may need to remain higher for longer to fight inflation.Markets however are pricing in rate cuts for late 2023, with fed fund futures implying a range of 4.25% to 4.5% by December.Hopes for less aggressive rate hikes boosted non-yielding gold, with spot prices for the precious metal hitting $1,858 per ounce by 1148 GMT, their highest since mid-June.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other currencies, meanwhile fell 0.6% as commodities currencies like the Australian dollar gained and the euro rose on the positive French and German inflation data.Sterling was last trading at $1.2055, up 0.74%, while the euro rose 0.6% to $1.0610, coming off a three-week low of $1.0519 touched overnight.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.12% versus the greenback to 130.85 per dollar.(Reporting by Lawrence White and Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Sam Holmes, Jan Harvey and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the acquisition, exploration, evaluation, and development of precious metal properties in Morocco. The company’s loss has recently broadened since it announced a US$307k loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$2.3m, moving it further away from breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Aya Gold &amp; Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. View our latest analysis for Aya Gold &amp; Silver Consensus from 4 of the Canadian Metals and Mining analysts is that Aya Gold &amp; Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2023, before generating positive profits of US$54m in 2024. So, the company is predicted to breakeven just over a year from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 86% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthGiven this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Aya Gold &amp; Silver's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Aya Gold &amp; Silver currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making metals and mining company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are too many aspects of Aya Gold &amp; Silver to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Aya Gold &amp; Silver's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of pertinent aspects you should look at:Valuation: What is Aya Gold &amp; Silver worth today?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES, Marathon Petroleum MPC, ExxonMobil XOM and Schlumberger SLB.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will These 5 Energy Stocks See Another Bull Run in 2023?The year 2022 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in what was its worst performance in more than a decade. With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight the persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s steepest annual loss since 2008, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with commodity prices soaring to new highs and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the year. The standout performers of 2022 were Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Energy Outperforms Amid CarnageAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the year deep in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while all others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index continued to move higher last year after comfortably topping the S&amp;P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It generated a total return of 58% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7%.Story continuesThe energy market continued to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union putting a price cap on Russian oil exports — even at the cost of their economies — the oil bulls have got a fresh impetus.While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the market’s precariously low level of spare capacity, China’s emergence from its strict COVID-19 restrictions, a stretched-out refining system, plus the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in 2022 and gained approximately 20% last year despite a steep selloff at the end of unseasonal warm weather projections for January. But overall, the commodity’s performance in 2022 was driven by a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat in the United States, high demand in Europe (as the continent reduces its dependence on Russian gas) and strong LNG shipments.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in 2022, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the yearly sectoral gains were Occidental Petroleum, Hess, Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Will these winners maintain their run in 2023 too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.This stock handily outperformed all other companies and was up 117.3% during the period, ranking first on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Occidental continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and benefit from the acquisition of Anadarko, the American multinational might have run out of steam. In particular, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company‘s massive long-term debt of more than $20 billion and exposure to volatile commodity prices could limit further share price gains.Hess Corporation: Hess is a leading global integrated energy company. The company’s E&amp;P activities are concentrated in Denmark, Guyana, Canada, Suriname, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and the United States. Additionally, Hess provides gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs.Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 91.6% last year. Its slew of discoveries in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, is a big positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Guyana is expected to become one of HES’ major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the energy operator’s rising costs and expenses, in addition to its relatively high debt-to-capitalization of 50.9%, can affect its financial flexibility. Finally, the dividend yield of Hess compares unfavorably to most of its peers and the S&amp;P 500.Marathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 81.9% in the past year. MPC’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement, per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the COVID lows, the continued increase in costs over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential for #3 Ranked MPC.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. XOM is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production, to refining and marketing.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 80.3% higher in the last twelve months. ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. With steadily increasing cash flows, XOM recently said that it will now buy back $50 billion of stock through 2024.However, the energy giant’s above-average capital spending program has got investors concerned. Also, the integrated energy major has been witnessing lower oil equivalent production volumes, which might affect the bottom line.Schlumberger: Schlumberger is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ended 78.5% higher in the January-December period. High commodity prices have increased demand for its services in energy markets across the globe. Schlumberger's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength, while its healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well.Additionally, its disciplined capital spending will likely benefit shareholders over the long term. While macro headwinds could still impact SLB’s EPS growth In 2023, it’s still a good investment for those interested in the energy market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

If you want to see more of the most valuable silicon valley companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World.Silicon Valley is a region in Northern California located around the San Francisco Bay Area that includes San Jose, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Plato Alto, Menlo Park, Cupertino, and also some other cities.Just as New York is known as the capital of finance, Silicon Valley has long been thought of by many as the capital of innovation. Given the region's history, many of the world's leading tech companies have their headquarters in the area.One reason for Silicon Valley's success is that the area has one of the world's leading universities located in the area in Stanford. Another world class university, Berkeley, is only 30 miles away. Another reason is that many of the world's top venture capital firms are based there such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. With smart founders, smart employees, and VC funding, many start ups have grown into giant world class companies today.Silicon Valley also benefits from being in the United States, which has the single largest economy in the world. By being American, companies headquartered in Silicon Valley have access to a huge market that could give them substantial economies of scale if they grow enough. Given the United States is the leader of the Western world, Silicon Valley companies also have access to many other developed markets as well.HistorySilicon Valley arguably started when William Shockley coinvented the transistor in the 1940s. Later, in 1956, Shockley would found Shockley Semiconductor Labs in Silicon Valley as the first company to make transistors out of silicon. In 1957, several Shockley employees would found Fairchild Semiconductor and later they would help found other leading tech companies such as Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and Kleiner Perkins.Story continuesAs a result of the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley, the computer industry took off in the area in later decades. As a result of the concentration of computer companies and venture capital, the internet industry grew substantially in the area beginning in the 1990's and 2000's.2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has had to increase interest rates substantially in 2022 and many Silicon Valley tech companies have faced headwinds as a result. Although the tech industry as a whole has more growth in the future, there could be more downside for individual companies if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Intel, Semiconductor, ChipPhoto by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World, we took the 15 most valuable companies with headquarters in Silicon Valley from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest tech companies by market cap list.Because Silicon Valley is mostly known for its technology, we only included tech companies on our list.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World.The luxury industry consists of manufacturers of personal luxury goods and companies that sell luxury experiences, such as those in the hospitality business. The demand in this sector is frequently correlated to income levels, especially in developed economies where the primary target market is located. However, in 2022, the global luxury market defied this logic, as it continued to grow under uncertain economic times, as per a report issued by Bain &amp; Company. The luxury sector experienced a sales boom in 2021 following COVID-19, and this trend persisted in 2022. According to Bain, the market for personal luxury products was expected to reach €353 billion by the end of 2022, a 22% YoY rise. Bain also forecasted the global luxury market to grow by 21% in 2022, closing the year at €1.4 trillion.An expanding customer base and the use of a multi-touchpoint ecosystem make the luxury market resilient against economic upheavals. Luxury companies are expanding this ecosystem to the virtual world, with several brands launching their metaverse strategies in 2022. LMVH, home to luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, launched its immersive virtual world at VivaTech, allowing customers to experience its innovations. L'Oréal has been dabbling in NFTs and is even considering adopting crypto as a payment method. Gucci also launched Gucci Town, a Roblox-based online marketplace for virtual clothing and games.Demand from Generation Z is the other main factor driving expansion. Millennials and Gen Z accounted for 72% of the global luxury market in 2022. Explaining the rise in demand from these younger customers, a Morgan Stanley report notes that a rising number of these younger customers have not yet moved out of their parents' houses. When young individuals free up their budget for daily essentials, they are left with more disposable income to spend on wants, which explains the rising demand for luxury items. The RealReal 2022 Luxury Resale Report also finds that, due to the development of a solid resale market, more customers, particularly Gen-Z, are viewing their luxury purchases as investments.Story continuesThe future of luxury corporations thus depends not only on macroeconomic conditions but also on how they can maintain their appeal to the socially and politically active Gen-Z and launch successful omnichannel marketing campaigns.littleny/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe focused more on the luxury clothing space for this article and picked the biggest luxury companies operating in the clothing, apparel, footwear and related industries.15.

Approximately 250 vegetation-management personnel also are at the ready.PG&amp;E is currently being supported by 16 crews from Southern California Edison and has requested mutual-aid assistance from additional West Coast power providers.The company is using its storm outage prediction models that help determine the potential timing, location, and number of power outages. This allows the company to have extra crews on standby to deploy to areas that are hard hit by the storm. PG&amp;E is also prestaging power poles, powerlines, transformers, and other electric equipment at yards throughout its service area to restore power to affected areas safely and as quickly as possible.The weather system forecasted to move through PG&amp;E's service area as early as Wednesday, Jan. 4, will deliver strong, gusty winds, moderate to heavy rain and a chance for isolated thunderstorms. Peak wind risk is expected Wednesday across the central and southern parts of PG&amp;E's service area, with gusts in the 35-45 MPH range at lower elevations and possibly 50-60 MPH across elevated terrain, portions of the Central Valley and along the Central Coast.Story continuesPotentially hazardous conditions such as flooding, mud slides and road closures—some which remain from the storms that occurred over New Year's weekend—could slow restoration efforts for some customers. The incoming adverse weather could result in trees, limbs and other debris falling into powerlines, damaging equipment, and interrupting electric service. Saturated soil in many locations could cause trees to fall, and localized flooding and mudslides are possible.""This weather system by itself would present widespread challenges, and we have to factor in that many parts of our service area remain saturated after last weekend's storm. Our crews have been working tirelessly to ensure we minimize any impacts this storm may have on our customers and hometowns. We encourage customers to prepare for the storm now – have an emergency plan in case you lose power and update your contact information on PG&amp;E's website so we can provide you with real-time updates on outages in your neighborhood,"" said Angie Gibson, vice president, PG&amp;E Emergency Preparedness &amp; ResponseKeeping Customers InformedCustomers can view real-time outage information at PG&amp;E's online outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email, or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.PG&amp;E is coordinating with its community-based partners to offer support to customers in need. PG&amp;E partners with the California Foundation for Independent Living Centers to offer support for older adults and people with disabilities through the Disability Disaster Access and Resources Program. As well, as the California Network of 2-1-1 who can connect customers to resources in their local communities.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored.

Cruise plans to use Azure to ramp up its autonomous vehicle solutions for commercial uses, and competes with Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox.Autonomous driving technologies are seen as revolutionary to the transportation and logistics industry, but have faced setbacks due to regulatory concerns on safety and less accessible funding in a slowing market.In November, Ford and Volkswagen shut down their self-driving technology unit, Argo AI, saying that creating self-driving ""robotaxis"" would be ""harder than putting a man on the moon.""Gatik, founded in 2017 by industry veterans Gautam Narang and Arjun Narang, focuses on middle-mile, business-to-business logistics for the retail industry.Since 2021, it has launched fully driverless commercial delivery services with Walmart Inc and Loblaw Companies Ltd, in which Gatik offers short-haul deliveries in box trucks in Arkansas and in Ontario, Canada.It has raised more than $120 million from investors including Koch Disruptive Technologies, Innovation Endeavors, Goodyear Ventures and RyderVentures.In the first quarter this year, Gatik plans to integrate its class 6 autonomous box trucks into the Pitney Bowes ecommerce logistics network in Dallas, Texas, aiming to boost deliveries and reduce logistics costs.(Reporting by Krystal Hu and Joe White; Editing by Edmund Klamann)]"

The initial release may be a limited test to a narrow group of users, the person added.The software maker, whose Bing service is far smaller than Alphabet Inc.’s dominant Google search engine, has been trying out ChatGPT for several months, the person said. Microsoft’s plans were reported earlier by The Information.OpenAI, the AI research shop backed by a $1 billion investment from Microsoft, publicly released ChatGPT for users to test in November. The chatbot’s ability to spout everything from cocktail recipes to authentic-seeming school essays has since catapulted it into the spotlight. While the AI service sometimes confidently offers incorrect information with a patina of authority, some analysts and experts have suggested its ability to summarize publicly available data can make it a credible alternative to Google search and a list of search-generated links.OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said in a tweet about ChatGPT last month that it’s “a mistake to be relying on it for anything important.”Story continuesLast month, Google employees asked CEO Sundar Pichai and AI research chief Jeff Dean about the chatbot’s threat to Google. Google has been working on similar technology in its LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications system, but faces reputational risk from any mistakes or errors, the two executives said, as reported by CNBC.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Walgreens Boots AllianceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Nancy Schlichting, for US$661k worth of shares, at about US$39.89 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$37.19. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Nancy Schlichting was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Walgreens Boots Alliance better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Walgreens Boots Alliance Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Walgreens Boots Alliance. Specifically, Independent Director Nancy Schlichting ditched US$661k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Walgreens Boots Alliance insiders own about US$166m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Walgreens Boots Alliance Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Walgreens Boots Alliance is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Taken along with misoprostol, the two-drug combination can terminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks in. But there has been a significant barrier to obtaining the drug: the FDA’s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) restrictions introduced in 2011. Since then, patients have had to pick up the medication directly from a doctor’s office, hospital, or health center, rather than from a pharmacy or by mail for 20 years, barring a temporary suspension of the rules for during the pandemic.With the recent tweaks, the FDA has removed the in-person dispensing requirement, and added the requirement for pharmacies who want to stock the drugs to be certified by one of the two manufacturers, GenBioPro and Danco Laboratories. Both CVS and Walgreens said they’re reviewing the FDA’s regulatory change.The pill is considered quite effective and safe–it’s only been linked to 26 deaths out of 4.9 million people estimated to have taken it since it was approved. In some countries, like Mexico, women don’t even need a prescription for it.Quotable: Improving access to abortion“By allowing brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense medication abortion care, the FDA is treating medication abortion like the safe, effective, time-sensitive care that it is.” —Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access projectCharted: Most US abortions are done using the pilldatawrapper-chart-4d5GcNot everyone can access mifepristoneThe anti-abortion winds have been raging in America ever since the June 2022 Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling awarding women the constitutional right to terminate pregnancies. Several states moved to ban abortion with a handful specifically targeting mifepristone.Story continuesImmediately after the court’s decision, attorney general Merrick B. Garland clarified that “States may not ban Mifepristone based on disagreement with the FDA’s expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.” In December, an Office of Legal Counsel opinion in response to a US Postal Service (USPS) query—whether federal law prohibits the mailing of mifepristone and misoprostol—said that the 1873 Comstock Act “does not prohibit the mailing of certain drugs that can be used to perform abortions where the sender lacks the intent that the recipient of the drugs will use them unlawfully.”But these explanations may not be enough to abate fears. The big chains could provide the drug in some states but not others. For smaller, local mom-and-pop stores, the legal implications may not be the only deterrent to stocking the drug. They may not see merit in doing the administrative heavy lifting to acquire the certification and designating an employee to carry out compliance if they don’t foresee enough demand.Abortion pill, by the digits$800: How much a medication abortion can cost.

A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Story continuesHere's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for WBAThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for WBA lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering WBA are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that WBA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for Walgreens is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock has declined 9.3% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why WBA Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of WBA shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 22.96. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering WBA in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, WBA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

These factors bode well for the Zacks Outsourcing industry.Automatic Data Processing, Inc.ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Genpact Limited G are some stocks that are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends. However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Industry DescriptionOutsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations, services or processes, previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources, to external resources or third-party contractors to improve operating efficiency by focusing on core business competencies. The Zacks Outsourcing industry comprises companies engaged in providing human capital management solutions, business management solutions and information technology solutions to human resource, payroll, benefits, and retirement and insurance services to small- and medium-sized businesses. Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry? A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for expertise in improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Rising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Story continuesNotably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Growing Security Issues and Remedies: COVID-led increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With success of the work-from-home and ongoign hybrid working models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, increased implementation of secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees about emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #99. This rank places it in the top 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The buy-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been increasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has increased 3.7%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can buy or retain given their growth prospects, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry's Price PerformanceThe Zacks Outsourcing industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 10.3% over this period compared with a 31.1% decline of the broader sector and 21.2% decrease of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing outsourcing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 24.91X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.69X and the sector’s 27.16X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.89X, as low as 17.89X and at the median of 23.48X, as the charts below show.Forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E)3 Outsourcing Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks that are well-positioned to grow in the near term.

It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. ADP has updated its fiscal 2023 outlook. It now expects revenues to register 8-9% growth (prior view: 7-9% growth). Adjusted EPS is now expected to register 15-17% growth (prior view: 13-16%). ADP expects Employer Services revenues to grow at a rate of about 7-8% (prior view: 6-8%), while PEO Services revenues are still expected to grow at a 10-12% rate.

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Throughout the pandemic, Starbucks bulked up in China. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Seattle-based giant now has 6,021 locations, compared to 4,706 in the fourth quarter of 2020.This expansion plan extends back to 2017, when Starbucks bought into roughly 50% of its licensed stores in mainland China.Because of this rapid expansion, Starbucks' operating earnings were impacted more than other food service chains, such as McDonald's (MCD) and Yum! Brands (YUM), Senatore explained in her note. However, Starbucks' operating earnings should reach 60% to 70% of its pre-pandemic levels this year, she said.Interim CEO Howard Schultz, meanwhile, has said he is committed to “playing the long game” in China, according to the analyst call following fourth-quarter results. He said Starbucks plans to reach 9,000 stores in China by 2025.“We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category but likely the number-one Western consumer brand in the country,"" he said.Senatore said Starbucks “will have no problem reaching its long-term targets.""Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Mobile orders are a key to Starbucks growth in China.In the fourth quarter of 2022, active Starbucks Rewards members grew 29% from Q4 to over 17 million members, just below historical levels which Schultz noted was “coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China.”As shown in the graph above, Senatore explained how COVID-19 lockdowns impacted Starbucks business in China.""The peak in the second quarter FY21, March, was as people felt more confident in going out and they were allowed to leave their homes. You see the increase of the people who have used the app in the last 90 days, but over the same period of time you're seeing an increase in mobile orders as a share of total,"" she said.She added that mobile orders typically result in a ""larger transaction.""The dips in mobile orders occurred when people ""weren’t leaving their homes"" (during COVID lockdowns). Mobile orders drove 44% of total orders in Q4 and delivery represented 24%.And as more Chinese consumers adopt the morning coffee routine, Starbucks can be seen as an ""accessible luxury"" in China.""Similar to ... the U.S., Starbucks is seen as an accessible luxury for the average consumer at a more premium price compared to that of the others listed [in the report: Costa Coffee, Tim Hortons and McCafe].""Bank of America is one of 14 Starbucks Buys on Wall Street.

Bank of America out with a new note reiterating its buy rating, but raising its price target to 125 a share. Brooke DiPalma is here with the details on that. And Brooke, this optimistic outlook, or more optimistic outlook, I should say, a lot of that has to do with the reopening in China.BROOKE DIPALMA: That's right. This note specifically regarding the reopening in China, alongside noting a strong rebound and poised to benefit as China once again abandons that three-year COVID-19 policy that's been in play that's really restricted mobility. Sara Senatore, a BofA analyst here, really highlighting that with more mobility, there will be more orders at Starbucks. So, really, what you're taking a look at is three specific notes here-- brand, scale, and tech.She notes that it's really an accessible luxury, similar to what we see here in the US, as we see a boom in perhaps consumers going out and buying Starbucks. They'll ultimately choose Starbucks, seen as a discount versus competitors overseas in China, versus gray box and coffee and Peet's, but also a 10% premium to that of premium Pacific Coffee and Luckin Coffee. So she notes that this is sort of a sweet spot and in between for consumers.Also scale-- Starbucks not shying away from boosting its presence in China despite these lockdowns. That's more than 6,000 locations in China now. That's up from 4,700 in 2020. So, of course, that's one thing that's coming out hot out of this COVID-19 policy lockdowns. And also technology here, she said that mobile orders really result in a larger transaction there. In Q4 in China, we saw 17 million reward members, and also mobile orders representing 44% of sales. So certainly all of these major sweet spot hitting the right spot for Sara Senatore at BofA. But she is one of 14 buys, 20 holds, and one sell on the Street right now for Starbucks.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: It's really interesting to read these upgrades about the China reopening as bodies pile up at the morgue, and the hospitals are beyond crowded. But let's set that aside for a moment. You said the word ""sweet spot."" Speaking of sweet, the new holiday menu, winter menu is out. I assume it's rather sweet, as usual.BROOKE DIPALMA: It looks pretty sweet. Now added to the menu this year, completely new is a pistachio cream cold brew. Now that's adding to the return of the pistachio latte, but the big story here is just how bullish, I guess you could say, Starbucks is on cold options. In Q4, we heard that 76% of orders were actually cold coffee options. And so that really makes up about 2/3 of Starbucks orders entirely.And, you know, what we saw in the fall of this year was the highlight of customization. They had that pumpkin spice cold brew option. And while people may not have gotten the pumpkin cold brew, they added that pumpkin spice cold brew foam on top. And that rose-- that led to, in part, to a 17% spike in their fall spice platform. And so perhaps Starbucks, once again, betting big on cold and hoping for a similar customization usage here.DAVE BRIGGS: The cold foam is delicious. But I will say I ordered the pistachio cream because I knew you were coming on today. I just got that in my cold brew, just the sauce in my cold brew. It was a lot like '22. It was forgettable.BROOKE DIPALMA: Ooh.DAVE BRIGGS: Like, it just was forgettable. That was--BROOKE DIPALMA: The year 2022, you're referring to?DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.BROOKE DIPALMA: Interesting. Interesting.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm sorry.SEANA SMITH: I thought you were excited about it. I don't know.DAVE BRIGGS: It was very forgettable.SEANA SMITH: It seems up your alley, something you could, like, spice up your morning drink with a little bit, makes it a little bit more exciting. No, it didn't-- I guess it didn't make the cut.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll keep trying. I'll keep going back to that--SEANA SMITH: I'll give it a-- yeah. Let me take a try, and I will give a review. Maybe I'll be a little bit more optimistic as we start the new year.DAVE BRIGGS: I love their cold brew, though. It's my favorite. Brooke DiPalma, always good to see you.BROOKE DIPALMA: Thank you so much.DAVE BRIGGS: Happy new year.]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.05bUS$2.79bUS$2.24bUS$2.15bUS$2.11bUS$2.09bUS$2.09bUS$2.11bUS$2.13bUS$2.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -1.93%Est @ -0.76%Est @ 0.06%Est @ 0.64%Est @ 1.04%Est @ 1.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$2.9kUS$2.5kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$43b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$89.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 4 years.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

STZ is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jan 5, 2023. The alcoholic beverage bigwig is expected to deliver top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.89 per share, indicating a 7.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down 2% in the past 30 days. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a 3.1% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. We expect the company’s fiscal third-quarter total revenues to increase 2.5% year over year to $2,379.1 million and comparable earnings to decline 12.8% to $2.72 per share.In the last reported quarter, the alcohol behemoth delivered an earnings surprise of 10.1%. Also, its bottom line beat estimates by 10.5%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseConstellation Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteKey Factors to NoteConstellation Brands is expected to have gained from continued growth in the beer business and robust consumer demand for its portfolio of premium, high-end products in the fiscal third quarter. STZ’s wine &amp; spirits business has been benefiting from its premiumization strategy focused on making investments to fuel growth of its power brands through innovation, capitalizing on priority, consumer trends and product introductions. Strength in high-end Power Brands, including The Prisoner Brand Family, Kim Crawford and Meiomi, have been key growth drivers.Constellation Brands has been significantly gaining from strength in the beer business. Depletion volume growth, stemming from strength in Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, has been aiding the top line. The beer segment has also been witnessing gains from premiumization, driven by growth in traditional beer as well as flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits and flavored malt beverages. These are likely to have aided the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect revenues for the beer business to increase 3.5% year over year to $1,813.4 million in the fiscal third quarter.However, higher COGS, and marketing and SG&amp;A expenses have been affecting the company’s earnings.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the operating margin in the second half of fiscal 2023 to be affected by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, additional headcount in training, increased depreciation related to its brewery capacity expansion, and higher marketing expenses.Supply-chain challenges and elevated material costs due to inflationary headwinds have been weighing on the company’s bottom-line performance. Constellation Brands has been witnessing supply-chain challenges, driven by container surcharges and warehousing costs, which are likely to have impacted its business in third-quarter fiscal 2023.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, we expect the adjusted operating margin to decline 400 bps year over year to 31.5%, driven by a 120-bps increase in SG&amp;A expense rate and a 280-bps rise in COGS as a percentage of sales.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Constellation Brands this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Constellation Brands has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -4.11%.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:Conagra Brands CAG currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.46% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register increases in the top and bottom lines when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 results.

94,2852e7e3-a861-3874-a245-daeab420d2da,ROP,2023-01-04,Roper Technologies (ROP) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roper-technologies-rop-upgraded-buy-170005338.html,1672765205,STORY,['ROP'],"[Roper Technologies (ROP) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Roper Technologies is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Roper Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Roper TechnologiesThis industrial equipment maker is expected to earn $14.13 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.4%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Roper Technologies. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Roper Technologies to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:ROP) Current Share Price Momentum?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-fundamentals-negative-impact-roper-145117159.html,1672757477,STORY,['ROP'],"[Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 14% over the last three months. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Roper Technologies'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Roper Technologies is:7.8% = US$1.1b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Roper Technologies' Earnings Growth And 7.8% ROEAt first glance, Roper Technologies' ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Roper Technologies over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 24% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Roper Technologies is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Roper Technologies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Roper Technologies has a low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (or a retention ratio of 75%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.Moreover, Roper Technologies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 19% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 11% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Roper Technologies' performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

However, When quite a few insiders buy shares, as it happened in Simon Property Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:SPG) case, it's fantastic news for shareholders.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Simon Property Group Simon Property Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent purchase by J. Smith is the biggest insider purchase of Simon Property Group shares that we've seen in the last year. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$118. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. The good news for Simon Property Group share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.While Simon Property Group insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. Their average price was about US$104. We don't deny that it is nice to see insiders buying stock in the company. But we must note that the investments were made at well below today's share price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeSimon Property Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Simon Property Group Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Simon Property Group. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$338k worth of shares. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Simon Property Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, currently worth about US$221m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Simon Property Group Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Simon Property Group. That's what I like to see! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

99,faf7e84b-cd63-3c0c-8358-b25510b86dee,GS,2023-01-04,Investing in Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) three years ago would have delivered you a 56% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-goldman-sachs-group-nyse-110101518.html,1672830061,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) shareholders have seen the share price rise 46% over three years, well in excess of the market return (15%, not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Goldman Sachs Group was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 9.09.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Goldman Sachs Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Goldman Sachs Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 56%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Goldman Sachs Group shares lost 11% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Goldman Sachs Group is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...But note: Goldman Sachs Group may not be the best stock to buy.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Performed in 2022Among the major stock exchanges in the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fared the best in 2022, declining just 8.8%. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.The Dow Jones, the 30-stock blue-chip index, had rallied almost 19% in 2021. But higher interest rates (the central banks across the globe tightened the monetary policy), 40-year-high inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty (heightened risk of a recession in the near term) roiled the markets in 2022, with the index slipping into the bear market in September-end. Further, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country, adding fuel to the fire.The outperformance of the Dow Jones index was driven by its exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors performed well last year, with energy being the best performing on the higher oil price. Additionally, industrials gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector received a boost from rising interest rates. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Visa and American Express – that are part of the index.In 2022, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP lost 15.3%, 10.2%, 4.1% and 9.7%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in these quality franchises.Story continuesPerformance in 2022While the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term remain a big headwind. Until now, cooling consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report and strong manufacturing activity suggest that a large part of the economy is holding up well. But higher rates have made borrowing expensive, pushing up the cost of buying a new car or house, increasing the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightening the risk of a recession.Hence, investors are cautious about entering the stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The bank has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of its competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions too.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. It has made substantial progress on this front, having already added more than 230 new branches and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past month.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In August 2022, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company acquired robo-advisor NextCapital. In April 2022, Goldman closed the acquisition of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., while in March, the company closed the buyout of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, the company acquired Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Such inorganic growth efforts will diversify the fee-revenue base and offer top-line stability.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first nine months of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 10.89, which is lower than the industry average of 14.50. Also, its P/B ratio of 1.07 is below the industry average of 1.56.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past seven days for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top-line growth in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #3 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that AXP is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company has formed strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It has also announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

101,28d41e7d-d7d3-3641-89d2-0d79c26a01ca,GS,2023-01-04,Goldman Sachs dealmakers see M&A recovery in second half of 2023,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-dealmakers-see-m-050458381.html,1672808698,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[By Saeed Azhar, Lananh Nguyen and Anirban SenNEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's top dealmakers are bullish on a recovery in global mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A) in the second half of 2023 despite a slowdown in economic growth and a weak credit market.As economic forecasts turn gloomier, executives at the Wall Street powerhouse - including Dan Dees and Jim Esposito, who jointly run its global banking and markets division - said they are primed for a recovery when financing markets ease up, potentially as early as the second half of 2023.The projections come after global M&amp;A values slumped 36% to $3.78 trillion in 2022, from a record $5.91 trillion in 2021, according to Dealogic data. Banks, including Goldman, have cut jobs as activity slumps.In a series of interviews with Reuters in recent weeks, top Goldman dealmakers who have been at the firm for more than two decades apiece said there are plenty of reasons for global deal activity to pick up.Big investors are sitting on piles of cash preparing to fund transactions, and large companies earning solid profits are looking to diversify their businesses - but they are waiting for economic uncertainty to fade, the bankers said.""I remain quite bullish, maybe not on the first quarter, but certainly as we go forward,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&amp;A. Still, there are ""clear headwinds in the first part"" of 2023, he said.Mark Sorrell, Feldgoise's counterpart in London, sees corporate clients jumping on deals when financing is available because their underlying motives are still intact, such as gaining new customers, new products or geographic expansion.Companies are staying on the sidelines because their creditors have pulled back from making riskier loans for buyouts as interest rates rise, but that could change rapidly, he said.""When the financing market comes back, we don't know when it will happen, but it will happen because of the amount of liquidity in the system, we think transaction volumes will and activity will recover,"" Sorrell said.Story continuesThe resurgence may be ""quicker than people expect,"" he said. TOP DEALMAKERSIf markets recover, Goldman's investment bankers stand to gain. The company has been the top global M&amp;A adviser by revenue for the past 20 years, followed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, according to Dealogic data.Despite that position, Goldman is not immune to a slowdown. Its investment-banking division accounted for just 13% of the company's revenue in the third quarter, shrinking from 27% a year earlier and 23% in the third quarter of 2018, when CEO David Solomon took the helm.The bank is preparing to cut thousands of employees in the new year, intensifying an earlier round of about 500 layoffs in September, Reuters reported earlier. Bonuses will also be slashed.Goldman's leaders said staffing levels were being adjusted to fit the economic environment, and in some cases, employees were being reassigned to more active areas.The bank sees opportunities in advising clients who are being targeted by activist investors, or fintech companies open to suitors after their valuations plunged, said Russ Hutchinson, the bank's chief operating officer of global M&amp;A.The fortunes of Wall Street's dealmakers hinge to a large extent on whether the leveraged loan market will reawaken after a lull last year. Some observers have drawn parallels to the global financial crisis, when plunging corporate valuations and a recession triggered by a collapse in the housing market froze the leveraged buyout (LBO) market.The current stress in the credit market is vastly different from 2008, said Esposito, Goldman's co-head of global banking and markets. During the crisis, the banking industry had more than $700 billion of stalled LBO exposure at its peak, which took 12 to 18 months to clear.Today, ""there's probably between $100 and $125 billion ... It's an almost inconsequential number compared to 2008, and equally importantly, the credit markets are so much deeper.""The market stress means lenders are less willing to finance deals because they are saddled with tens of billions of dollars of so-called ""hung debt"" that they are unable to sell on to investors.But for all the market turbulence, Goldman veterans remain confident.""When you go through periods of volatility, you know it creates opportunity,"" Dees said.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar, Lananh Nguyen and Anirban Sen; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Stephen Coates)]"

103,ee498571-90c9-3993-8965-38830253d5c2,GS,2023-01-04,Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Performed in 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-4-dow-finance-stocks-131101921.html,1672751461,STORY,"['GS', 'AXP', 'V', 'JPM', '^DJI', 'COMP', '^GSPC', 'GSBD']","[Among the major stock exchanges in the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fared the best in 2022, declining just 8.8%. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.The Dow Jones, the 30-stock blue-chip index, had rallied almost 19% in 2021. But higher interest rates (the central banks across the globe tightened the monetary policy), 40-year-high inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty (heightened risk of a recession in the near term) roiled the markets in 2022, with the index slipping into the bear market in September-end. Further, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country, adding fuel to the fire.The outperformance of the Dow Jones index was driven by its exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors performed well last year, with energy being the best performing on the higher oil price. Additionally, industrials gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector received a boost from rising interest rates. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP – that are part of the index.In 2022, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP lost 15.3%, 10.2%, 4.1% and 9.7%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in these quality franchises. Performance in 2022Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term remain a big headwind. Until now, cooling consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report and strong manufacturing activity suggest that a large part of the economy is holding up well. But higher rates have made borrowing expensive, pushing up the cost of buying a new car or house, increasing the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightening the risk of a recession.Hence, investors are cautious about entering the stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The bank has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of its competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions too.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. It has made substantial progress on this front, having already added more than 230 new branches and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past month.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In August 2022, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company acquired robo-advisor NextCapital. In April 2022, Goldman closed the acquisition of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., while in March, the company closed the buyout of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, the company acquired Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Such inorganic growth efforts will diversify the fee-revenue base and offer top-line stability.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first nine months of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 10.89, which is lower than the industry average of 14.50. Also, its P/B ratio of 1.07 is below the industry average of 1.56.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past seven days for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top-line growth in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #3 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that AXP is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company has formed strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It has also announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,142a7357-e29f-389d-a059-d8aba3ca7512,MAT,2023-01-04,Shopify Launches ‘Commerce Components’ to Accelerate Growth,WWD,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/142a7357-e29f-389d-a059-d8aba3ca7512/shopify-launches-%E2%80%98commerce.html,1672777575.0,STORY,"['SHOP', 'MAT']","[Shopify, which has built a global business enabling small entrepreneurs to set up online stores, is seeking to further its growth by beginning to cater to large, established retailers.On Tuesday, Shopify officially introduced “Commerce Components” where enterprise retailers — those that typically range from $500 million to multiple billions of dollars in gross merchandise value — can integrate components of Shopify into their own systems on an a la carte basis.More from WWDZuhair Murad Pre-Fall 2023What To Watch: Men's TrendsLuisaViaRoma &amp; UNICEF 2022 Winter Gala Fetes Rita Ora, Naomi Watts &amp; More in St. Barths“We’ve always approached innovation at Shopify by anticipating what retailers need then providing those solutions,” said Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify. “Commerce Components by Shopify opens our infrastructure so enterprise retailers don’t have to waste time, engineering power and money building critical foundations Shopify has already perfected, and instead frees them up to customize, differentiate and scale.”Finkelstein said it’s the first time Shopify is giving the world’s largest retailers access to its component infrastructure.Mattel’s portfolio of toy brands; JB Hi-Fi, Australia’s largest home entertainment retailer; fashion and shoe retailer Steve Madden, and Staples, which sells business and home office supplies and home essentials, are tapping into Commerce Components, according to Shopify.Along with introducing Commerce Components, Shopify continues to focus its offerings on entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses, and high growth direct-to-consumer businesses.Launched in Ottawa, Canada, in 2006, Shopify said it powers more than 10 percent of U.S. e-commerce and has processed more than half a trillion dollars. Shopify is built on the premise that given the rapid pace of tech evolution and shifting customer expectations, retailers and brands must achieve real-time innovation to remain competitive in the world of e-commerce. While providing the infrastructure for this, the company underscores that it still gives businesses “full control” of their brand identity, customer relationships and data.Story continuesThere are more than 30 components offered by Shopify, among them Shop Pay, a one-click checkout system processing up to 40,000 checkouts per minute per store. There are also components for shipping and logistics; unifying physical retail and online sales with custom integrations that work with any point of sale system for an omnichannel approach; chat and support services; data analysis; cross-border selling, and targeting discounts and promotions to the right customers, among other components.Shopify provides flexible APIs, or application programming interfaces, so its modular components can be integrated “seamlessly” into the back office functions and services of retailers and brands.“Brands using Commerce Components will have access to our globally scaled infrastructure with more than 275 network edge points around the world, or nodes, that enable lightning-fast storefronts no matter where customers are in the world,” the company indicated.Shopify is considered the largest commerce ecosystem in the world. It has a dedicated account team with solutions architects, 24/7 support and a network of agency partners and system integrators including Deloitte, EY and KPMG. Shopify’s global infrastructure contains more than 150 network edge points of presence that enables lightning-fast storefronts no matter where customers are in the world.“We know that retailers have myriad opportunities in the digital and data age, whether it’s the shifting digital advertising landscape or showing up for their customers in a differentiated way during a looming recession,” Sam Roddick, global Deloitte digital leader, said in a statement. “In challenging times, we have seen best-in-class alliances between our clients and their platform partners unlock these opportunities. That’s why we’re thrilled to work with Shopify to bring Commerce Components by Shopify to enterprise retailers globally.”“Innovation is at the heart of Mattel,” Sven Gerjets, Mattel’s chief technology officer, said in a statement. “We first worked with Shopify on a project called Mattel Creations, a platform for creators to reimagine the most iconic toys in the world. Creations empowered Mattel to move quickly, meet our customers where they are, and most importantly leverage Shopify’s infrastructure to scale globally. It was hugely successful, and we’re excited to transform our brand offerings using Commerce Components.”]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES, Marathon Petroleum MPC, ExxonMobil XOM and Schlumberger SLB.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will These 5 Energy Stocks See Another Bull Run in 2023?The year 2022 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in what was its worst performance in more than a decade. With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight the persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s steepest annual loss since 2008, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with commodity prices soaring to new highs and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the year. The standout performers of 2022 were Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Energy Outperforms Amid CarnageAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the year deep in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while all others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index continued to move higher last year after comfortably topping the S&amp;P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It generated a total return of 58% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7%.Story continuesThe energy market continued to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union putting a price cap on Russian oil exports — even at the cost of their economies — the oil bulls have got a fresh impetus.While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the market’s precariously low level of spare capacity, China’s emergence from its strict COVID-19 restrictions, a stretched-out refining system, plus the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in 2022 and gained approximately 20% last year despite a steep selloff at the end of unseasonal warm weather projections for January. But overall, the commodity’s performance in 2022 was driven by a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat in the United States, high demand in Europe (as the continent reduces its dependence on Russian gas) and strong LNG shipments.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in 2022, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the yearly sectoral gains were Occidental Petroleum, Hess, Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Will these winners maintain their run in 2023 too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.This stock handily outperformed all other companies and was up 117.3% during the period, ranking first on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Occidental continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and benefit from the acquisition of Anadarko, the American multinational might have run out of steam. In particular, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company‘s massive long-term debt of more than $20 billion and exposure to volatile commodity prices could limit further share price gains.Hess Corporation: Hess is a leading global integrated energy company. The company’s E&amp;P activities are concentrated in Denmark, Guyana, Canada, Suriname, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and the United States. Additionally, Hess provides gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs.Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 91.6% last year. Its slew of discoveries in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, is a big positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Guyana is expected to become one of HES’ major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the energy operator’s rising costs and expenses, in addition to its relatively high debt-to-capitalization of 50.9%, can affect its financial flexibility. Finally, the dividend yield of Hess compares unfavorably to most of its peers and the S&amp;P 500.Marathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 81.9% in the past year. MPC’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement, per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the COVID lows, the continued increase in costs over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential for #3 Ranked MPC.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. XOM is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production, to refining and marketing.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 80.3% higher in the last twelve months. ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. With steadily increasing cash flows, XOM recently said that it will now buy back $50 billion of stock through 2024.However, the energy giant’s above-average capital spending program has got investors concerned. Also, the integrated energy major has been witnessing lower oil equivalent production volumes, which might affect the bottom line.Schlumberger: Schlumberger is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ended 78.5% higher in the January-December period. High commodity prices have increased demand for its services in energy markets across the globe. Schlumberger's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength, while its healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well.Additionally, its disciplined capital spending will likely benefit shareholders over the long term. While macro headwinds could still impact SLB’s EPS growth In 2023, it’s still a good investment for those interested in the energy market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NYSE:AIG) sold US$1.4m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-american-international-group-inc-110055492.html,1672830055,STORY,['AIG'],"[Over the past year, many American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American International GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Luciana Fato, sold US$918k worth of shares at a price of US$54.01 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$62.93, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 28% of Luciana Fato's holding.In the last year American International Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like American International Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does American International Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. American International Group insiders own about US$67m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About American International Group Insiders?The fact that there have been no American International Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by American International Group insiders. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for American International Group (1 is a bit unpleasant) you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Our estimate suggests general operating and other expenses to decline 2.6% year over year in 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American International’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $4.33 per share, which has been unchanged over the past week. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $4.13 per share. AIG beat on earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed once, the average beat being 13%. The consensus estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $45 billion, while our estimate is pegged at $44.9 billion.American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteThe Fed opted for multiple aggressive interest rate hikes last year to counter the fastest inflation pace witnessed in more than 40 years. Even though the intensity is expected to decline this year, the growing interest rate environment is likely to benefit investment income from AIG’s General Insurance North America operations.Story continuesThe improving economy and declining COVID-related restrictions have led to increased consumer spending. This is likely to drive AIG’s net written premiums and revenue growth in the days ahead. Its personal lines insurance business is expected to continue witnessing an improvement in travel and warranty operations.The company’s prudent capital allocation to buyouts and shareholder value-boosting measures is a major positive. Strategic acquisitions help the company scale its business and improve its product portfolio. Its capital deployment efforts enhance shareholder value through share buybacks and dividend payouts.In the first nine months of 2022, AIG rewarded shareholders with $4,370 million in share buybacks and dividends worth $746 million. At the third-quarter end, it had $4.6 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization.RisksThere are a few factors that might mar American International’s prospects.In the trailing 12 months, AIG’s free cash flow declined 27.8% to $4.5 billion. Also, American International’s return on equity of 7.3% is lower than the industry average of 8.4%. This reflects AIG’s relative inefficiency in utilizing its shareholders’ funds to generate profits. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive AIG’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are CI Financial Corp.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, CSX Corp. CSX, American International Group, Inc. AIG and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. CNP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Earnings Outlook for 2023, and Featured Reports for Apple, J&amp;J and OthersThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today’s Research Daily features an update on the evolving earnings picture for 2023 and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and CSX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Earnings Outlook for 2023Multiple forces are at play in driving stock prices at any point in time. But the two biggest forces in the long run are interest rates and corporate earnings, with our focus in this note solely on the earnings part.Aggregate bottom-up earnings for the S&amp;P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.2% in 2023 on +2.1% higher revenues. This would follow the +4.7% earnings growth in 2022 on +10.6% higher revenues.Estimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, after peaking in mid-April 2022. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates have declined by -9.4% since mid-April for the index as a whole and -11.8% excluding the Energy sector.Estimates have been cut for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Construction (Negative revision of -29.6% since mid-April), Consumer Discretionary (-21.5%), Retail (-21.2%), Tech (-19.6%), Industrials (-13.8%), Aerospace (-13.7%), and Transportation (-10.2%). Estimates for Energy, Utilities, Autos and Basic Materials have modestly increased.Story continuesThe future course of revisions will depend on how the underlying economic outlook unfolds in response to the Fed tightening cycle.I am of the opinion that a relatively benign outcome for the U.S. economy where it is able to dodge a nasty recession will be consistent with an earnings outlook that is roughly in-line with current earnings estimates.I am not suggesting that estimates do not need to come down further. But rather than aggregate estimates outside of the Energy sector already down by almost -12% since mid-April, there may not be a whole lot of further room to fall as long as the economic outlook doesn't materially deteriorate.Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Apple have declined -27.9% over the past year against the Zacks Tech sector's decline of -37.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -20.9% pullback. The Zacks analyst believes that Apple’s holiday season iPhone shipments are expected to suffer from disruptions at its Chinese partner Foxconn’s factory in Zhengzhou. We expect Apple to ship roughly 70 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The company expects year-over-year revenue growth to decelerate in the fiscal first quarter compared with the fiscal fourth quarter due to unfavorable forex. Mac revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by forex. Apple expects Mac revenues to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter.Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Nevertheless, a growing subscriber base in the Services business and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +3.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +12.3%. The Zacks analyst believes that J&amp;J’s sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.However, macroeconomic headwinds like inflationary pressure, rising input costs and negative currency impact are hurting margins. Headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue. Stelara’s upcoming loss of exclusivity in 2023 is a concern. Though J&amp;J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, they continue to remain an overhang on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Johnson &amp; Johnson here &gt;&gt;&gt;)CSX shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past six months (+6.5% vs. +3.5%). The Zacks analyst believes that CSX is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, domestic intermodal shipments and favorable pricing. With the demand scenario expected to remain strong, despite the current market bloodbath, management anticipates double-digit growth in operating income and revenues for 2022 from 2021's reported levels.However, supply-chain disturbances are hurting CSX's operations. Weakness in the merchandise segment due to lower volumes of fertilizers is concerning. High costs, primarily due to escalating fuel expenses, pose a threat to CSX’s bottom line. High capital expenditures are also worrisome.(You can read the full research report on CSX here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include American International Group, Inc. and CenterPoint Energy, Inc.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.4% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.72%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device maker had lost 0.4% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Medical sector's loss of 2.63% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.57% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Hologic as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Hologic is projected to report earnings of $0.87 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 59.91%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $962.24 million, down 34.59% from the prior-year quarter.HOLX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.46 per share and revenue of $3.81 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -42.52% and -21.56%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Hologic. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Hologic is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Hologic has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.59 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 30.46.Story continuesMeanwhile, HOLX's PEG ratio is currently 1.42. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Medical - Instruments was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.16 at yesterday's closing price.The Medical - Instruments industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 91, which puts it in the top 37% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

113,7660e27e-2f46-3fc4-bb81-9ca459a4b915,HOLX,2023-01-04,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-trending-stock-140002770.html,1672754402,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, indicating a change of -59.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -42.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $962.24 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -34.6%. The $3.81 billion and $4.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.6% and +5.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm putting a buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to 310 a share. Joining us now to discuss is the analyst behind that note. We want to bring in Ken Leon, CFRA's director of equity research. Ken, it's great to have you here. So let's talk about why you're more bullish on Netflix. Certainly, 2022 was a tough year for not only Netflix, but really the industry at large. Why do you see that tide turning this year?KEN LEON: Well, thanks for having me. And 2023 and '24 are going to be, I think, great years for Netflix after a challenging '22. We had a sell rating for most of '22. And mostly, we were too severe, I think, on our valuation where we feel it was-- or felt was no different than any of its peer group.But then we took another look at this company, and we looked at some of the new catalysts for 2023. And we say Netflix does deserve a premium. We're talking about a company where it has management in place for over 10 years. That's not true for Disney, Warner Brothers, or even Paramount. Secondly, the company's single focus on video streaming and the secular shift is from linear networks to video streaming.Additionally, they have really invested in both programming content and technology platform that they're getting-- they're reaping the benefits not only in the US and Europe, but also in markets like South Korea, Turkey, et cetera. So where that leads you is a premium valuation. So we raised our target up to 310. We still think this company has lots of opportunity with new revenue sources. Widely noted is advertisers and marketers for the first time will be using Netflix platform.Second would be the new ad pay plan at $6.99 per month, more likely to bring in demographics, more middle class, less affluent. And it won't cannibalize their current base, which goes as high as 19.99 per month for, really, a lot of features you can't get at the lower rate.Story continuesAnd lastly-- and this is kind of the unspoken truth-- is so many of us and friends and family share our account. And that's going to be, I'll say gracefully, pulled back or where you can be added for maybe $2 or $3 a month. So all that leakage is going to create revenue and cash flow for Netflix. So I like what I'm seeing. I also think, again, they continue to deliver great new episodes, great new features, and they're not spending billions of dollars on a market loss leader, which is sporting events, which has become so crazy to compete with to get any of those.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it's interesting to see them stay out. It does look like a good decision when you consider $75 billion a year for the NBA. But it's that ad tier that was supposed to be the game changer. And the initial rollout didn't sound so good. Only 9% of new signups chose that tier. And Netflix had to return money to advertisers. Why does that not factor in? And where do you see that improving?KEN LEON: We see it improving in the second half of this year into 2024. When you look at the 47 analysts who cover this stock, they do have growth in both revenue-- and this is part of it-- in '23, but then up in '24 and a significant increase in EBITDA, which is an important measure for valuation.So again, what we haven't seen yet is not only this lower rate ad pay plan, but which is, true, small out of the gate, but also the advertisers, both for spot and longer term contracts, which are going to get new business. And they're going to take that away from some of the broadcast networks in terms of advertising.SEANA SMITH: Ken, when it comes to live sports, a number of arrivals, Netflix's rivals, have turned to that in order to drive some of that subscription growth. You make the case that you don't think that's necessary. I guess, why not? Is it purely just based on the amount that some of these rivals are paying for those rights?KEN LEON: It really is. It just-- it's such a high hurdle that to really have that kind of investment, it's-- the returns are just very challenging. But if you're live sports and live news like Fox, and we have a buyer in FOXA, and they're staying out of streaming, they do that very well. Paramount is trying to do both. Disney with ESPN is trying to do sports and streaming.Disney's got a lot of challenges, but the stock has been so hit that we think Bob Iger is going to create some new catalysts to get the stock higher, which is why we have a buy in Disney. But again, for best in class, that premium to the peer group and a management that executes and trusts each other for over 10 years, I think we're going to see good things from Netflix in 2023.DAVE BRIGGS: Ken, Netflix spent 450 million to acquire the ""Glass Onion"" franchise, if you will, the ""Knives Out"" franchise. ""Glass Onion,"" terrific movie. What is stickier for streamers right now? Is it movies like that, or is it the shows that they have really found success with, more like ""Emily in Paris""? Is that worth the money?KEN LEON: They have both. So whereas if you go to Amazon Prime Video, a major competitor that spent billions just related to getting the ""Lord of the Rings"" or, in the case of HBO Max, with, of course, ""House of Dragons,"" which was great, but it was over in, what, 10 episodes? So, you know, Netflix is just prolific. They spend about $17 billion. It looks like the list-- you have to remember, again, this is an organically grown company that hasn't made acquisitions other than this one recently.And they've been able to generate an enormous library of their known franchises and episodes, as well as movies. So, more to come from Netflix, and they're actually more confident generally of their own creation versus spending over a billion and getting a flash. And then once it's over, you have higher churn.So, you know, a lot more to see here on these issues. But again, Netflix has confidence in how they do business. I don't believe Paramount, Warner Brothers, Discovery, or Disney have video streaming figured out yet. And then there's a host of other players here that are here either for one big spend, big event, whether it's Amazon or even perhaps YouTube getting Sunday NFL streaming. And they're all experimenting, but Netflix fully understands this business. That gives them an edge.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, CFRA director of equity research, Ken Leon, good to see you, sir. Thank you.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Townsquare Media and Netflix are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TSQ is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TSQ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.11, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 28.60. We also note that TSQ has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.36.Another notable valuation metric for TSQ is its P/B ratio of 1.97. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 6.39.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to TSQ's Value grade of A and NFLX's Value grade of C.TSQ has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NFLX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that TSQ is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more of the most valuable silicon valley companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World.Silicon Valley is a region in Northern California located around the San Francisco Bay Area that includes San Jose, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Plato Alto, Menlo Park, Cupertino, and also some other cities.Just as New York is known as the capital of finance, Silicon Valley has long been thought of by many as the capital of innovation. Given the region's history, many of the world's leading tech companies have their headquarters in the area.One reason for Silicon Valley's success is that the area has one of the world's leading universities located in the area in Stanford. Another world class university, Berkeley, is only 30 miles away. Another reason is that many of the world's top venture capital firms are based there such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. With smart founders, smart employees, and VC funding, many start ups have grown into giant world class companies today.Silicon Valley also benefits from being in the United States, which has the single largest economy in the world. By being American, companies headquartered in Silicon Valley have access to a huge market that could give them substantial economies of scale if they grow enough. Given the United States is the leader of the Western world, Silicon Valley companies also have access to many other developed markets as well.HistorySilicon Valley arguably started when William Shockley coinvented the transistor in the 1940s. Later, in 1956, Shockley would found Shockley Semiconductor Labs in Silicon Valley as the first company to make transistors out of silicon. In 1957, several Shockley employees would found Fairchild Semiconductor and later they would help found other leading tech companies such as Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and Kleiner Perkins.Story continuesAs a result of the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley, the computer industry took off in the area in later decades. As a result of the concentration of computer companies and venture capital, the internet industry grew substantially in the area beginning in the 1990's and 2000's.2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has had to increase interest rates substantially in 2022 and many Silicon Valley tech companies have faced headwinds as a result. Although the tech industry as a whole has more growth in the future, there could be more downside for individual companies if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Intel, Semiconductor, ChipPhoto by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World, we took the 15 most valuable companies with headquarters in Silicon Valley from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest tech companies by market cap list.Because Silicon Valley is mostly known for its technology, we only included tech companies on our list.

This puts the movie on track to beat PARAMOUNT GLBL’s PARA Top Gun: Maverick’s total gross return, which has the bragging rights as the highest-grossing movie at the domestic box office for 2022.Paramount GLBL’s Tom Cruise movie secured $1.49 billion in sales in 2022. However, Avatar became the fastest release to cross the box office’s $1 billion threshold since Spider-Man: No Way Home in December 2021, and the fastest in 2022, the movie is en route to becoming the highest-grossing movie.In the first week of release, Imax reported that the latest Avatar movie grossed $435 million globally. Of this, Imax delivered $48.8 million, which majorly came from the box offices of North America and China as they recorded $16.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively, making Avatar: The Way of Water IMAX's biggest December global opening of all time.While Disney did not reveal the budget of the Avatar sequel, James Cameron, the director of the movie, cited that it has to be the third or fourth highest-grossing movie to break even. Being allowed to open up in China might enable the franchise movie to live up to past performance expectations.The first Avatar movie, released in 2009, grossed nearly $2.9 billion worldwide, with $259 million from China, making it the highest-grossing film of all time. It edged out Avengers: Endgame after a September 2022 rerelease as the movie added $73 million in ticket sales.The latest box office performance of the Avatar movie will also help Disney fund its key growth drivers like Disney+. However, Disney+ is facing significant competition in the streaming market from Netflix NFLX and Apple’s AAPL Apple TV+. Further, it is spending huge capital to bring original content to fight against stiff competition in an extremely saturated market.Story continuesThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteDisney Funds Disney+ to Boost ProspectsDisney is focusing on its streaming service, which will cost the company capital in terms of content and marketing to fend off competition from Netflix and Apple. Netflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space and is enjoying the first mover’s advantage in the industry. Its solid content portfolio is a major growth driver.Since the launch of Apple TV+, several Apple original series and films have earned more than 240 awards and 950 nominations, including the acclaimed SAG Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Critics Choice Awards. These accolades are catching viewers’ attention and helping Apple win market share from Netflix and Disney.To fight peers, we expect Disney to expand its Direct-to-Consumer spending by 12.5% year over year. As a result, the Direct-to-Consumer operating loss is expected at $4.88 billion for fiscal 2023 compared with $4 billion in fiscal 2022. The rising spending and losses are expected to keep consolidated margins under pressure.Also, DIS has an extremely leveraged balance sheet, portraying that it is lending more money to grow the business in a highly fragmented market. Total borrowings were $48.37 billion as of Oct 1, 2022, compared with $46.6 billion as of Jul 2, 2022. Disney’s debt balance compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities balance of $11.62 billion.Such headwinds impacted the share price of Disney, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). In the six-month period, its shares fell 9.6% compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s decline of 10.1%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, Disney expects Disney+ to reach profitability by 2024.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has gained 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $4.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -15.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.45 points to a change of +241.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.15 indicates a change of -27.2% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $170.55 billion and $145.04 billion estimates indicate +48.5% and -15% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $48.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.9%. EPS of $6.46 for the same period compares with $3.18 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.49%. The EPS surprise was +29.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study TJX Companies'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:60% = US$3.4b ÷ US$5.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.60 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 60% ROETo begin with, TJX Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 29% which is quite remarkable. Despite this, TJX Companies' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesWe then compared TJX Companies' net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 34% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if TJX Companies is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 39% (meaning the company retains61% of profits) in the last three-year period, TJX Companies' earnings growth was more or les flat. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, TJX Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 35%.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 8th of March to $2.13. This will take the annual payment to 3.2% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, Amgen was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 28.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 54% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAmgen Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.44 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $8.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 19% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Earnings have grown at around 2.8% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. Growth of 2.8% may indicate that the company has limited investment opportunity so it is returning its earnings to shareholders instead. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.We Really Like Amgen's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Amgen that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(TSE:AYA) Before Long,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-expect-breakeven-aya-gold-110730245.html,1672830450,STORY,['M'],"[We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc.'s (TSE:AYA) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the acquisition, exploration, evaluation, and development of precious metal properties in Morocco. The company’s loss has recently broadened since it announced a US$307k loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$2.3m, moving it further away from breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Aya Gold &amp; Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. View our latest analysis for Aya Gold &amp; Silver Consensus from 4 of the Canadian Metals and Mining analysts is that Aya Gold &amp; Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2023, before generating positive profits of US$54m in 2024. So, the company is predicted to breakeven just over a year from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 86% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthGiven this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Aya Gold &amp; Silver's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Aya Gold &amp; Silver currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making metals and mining company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are too many aspects of Aya Gold &amp; Silver to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Aya Gold &amp; Silver's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of pertinent aspects you should look at:Valuation: What is Aya Gold &amp; Silver worth today?

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the World.Nickel production started globally in 1824 through cobalt blue production while the first large-scale production began in 1848 in Norway. The demand for nickel increased in the late 19th century and its production started to make progress in the early 20th century with the discovery of the metal in Canada, Russia, and South Africa. Currently, Indonesia is the country with the largest nickel reserves at 21 million metric tons out of the global 95 million metric tons of reserves (1 ton = 2000 pounds, 1 tonne, or metric ton = 2,240 pounds).Significance in the EV market and Other UsesThe first common use of nickel was to make coins. However, it is fast becoming one of the most important components in EV batteries. According to BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), the demand for nickel will increase 4x in the next 30 years due to the rise of the EV industry. The company’s 85% of the nickel sulfate production is used in batteries. According to a Reuters report, there is enough lithium and nickel to power 14 million EV batteries in 2023 and the number is expected to reach 21 million EVs globally by 2025. Between 2021 and 2030, the global EV market is expected to show a CAGR of 18.2% and reach $823.75 billion by 2030. Global EV sales were recorded at 2 million in 2020, which increased by over 100% to 4.2 million in 2021.Apart from the EV industry, the aerospace and defense industry is another prospect for nickel market growth. Nickel alloys are used by the aerospace and defense industry for turbines of jet engines, exhaust valves, thermostat valves, tanks, and piping due to nickel’s heat-resistant nature and metal integrity.The most common use of nickel is in stainless steel production. Over 66% of the global nickel ore is used to produce stainless steel for kitchen equipment, chemical industries, metallurgy, and several other industries.Story continuesNickel Market History, Growth, and FutureNickel reached its peak per tonne price in April 2007 at $50,000 mainly due to low inventory levels. After its 2007 peak, the industry saw a decline over the years to approximately $8,100 in May 2016. In the current year, the metal peaked at $48,000 in March before recording the lowest level of $21,100 in September. Currently, Nickel is trading at $30,234. In March 2022, the metal price went up to $100,000 for a few moments, which will be discussed later.The average nickel price in the first three quarters of 2022 was $25,684 per tonne which was 43% higher than in the same period of 2021. In addition, at the end of September, the nickel stocks on London Metal Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange amounted to 55,080 tonnes, compared to 161,570 tonnes at the end of September 2021.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global nickel market was worth $33.31 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $59.14 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period. According to the report, stainless steel used by the automotive, consumer goods, and construction industries will be the primary growth driver for the metal’s price and demand.Some of the biggest nickel mining companies include OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel (LSE:MNOD), Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), and Glencore plc (OTC:GLNCY).Chaos in MarchOn March 8, the nickel prices surged by 66% within a day to $48,078 at 5:42 am. Later on, the prices saw a sudden surge of 250% to over $100,000 per tonne around 6 a.m. The main reason for this sudden price hike was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The prices spread mayhem in the market as there was a giant short position held by Xiang Guangda, the founder of Tsingshan Holding Group.The Russian invasion led to sanctions on the country which spread the fear that the world’s third-largest producer’s nickel might be banned in Europe, causing the supply deficit to be much greater than the demand. The short position held by Xiang Guanda led him to hot waters as his firm had to pay $10 billion due to margin calls. However, to curb the situation, the London Metal Exchange stopped the trade for a couple of hours which brought the price back to $48,000 per tonne levels.10 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyAfter an assessment of the nickel industry and the biggest nickel mining companies, we chose the 10 biggest nickel mining companies.

Both contracts plummeted over 4% each on Tuesday.A sharp recovery in the dollar also weighed on crude prices, with the dollar index surging more than 1% on Tuesday as traders positioned for the minutes of the Fed’s December meeting, due to be released later on Wednesday.Focus will be on whether policymakers support a further slowing in interest rate hikes, following an increasing number of signs that U.S. inflation has likely peaked. But given that inflation is still trending well above the Fed’s target range, markets remained on edge.A slew of U.S. data this week is also expected to shed more light on the world’s largest oil consumer, starting with manufacturing activity data for December due later in the day. Nonfarm payrolls data for December, due on Friday, is also expected to provide more insight into the jobs market.Traders fear that a sustained rise in U.S. interest rates could weigh on economic activity and potentially trigger a recession in 2023- a scenario that is negative for crude demand. The prospect of a recession triggered wild swings in oil prices through 2022, and is expected to cause more volatility in the near-term.Concerns over a delayed economic recovery in China were also heightened after President Xi Jinping struck a more cautious tone than expected during his new year's address. The country is grappling with an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases after it relaxed several restrictions in December.Story continuesAnalysts warned that rising infections in the country are likely to delay an economic reopening, and could potentially damage the Chinese economy even further in the near-term.

Copper futures were flat around $3.7707 a pound on Wednesday, after plummeting nearly 2% in the prior session.The red metal is sensitive to any changes in the economic outlook, given its heavy use in industrial applications.

However, no agreement was forthcoming, prompting the two sides to raise the stakes to protect their interests in the mine, known as Cobre Panama.The dispute, which began at the end of 2021, has become a litmus test of Panama's ability to remain attractive to business even as the government seeks to reduce inequality by reviewing longterm deals that many analysts regard as too generous to business.""Cobre Panama is the only metal mine operating in the country and many foreign companies started operations in Panama with its arrival. What happens will have a huge impact that seems to have not been properly weighed by both parties,"" said Zorel Morales, director of Panama's mining chamber.Failure to reach a deal could spook foreign investors at a time when Panama is looking to develop three other copper deposits that could bring in investments similar to Cobre Panama's, said Morales.Panama's demand that the company pay at least $375 million in annual tax has been at the center of the dispute, and during last week's talks First Quantum raised points it wanted included in its contract after a Dec. 14 deadline to reach agreement expired, according to a source linked to the government.Exclusive rights to explore other minerals, enlarge the area of its concession, a $1 billion tax credit for its investment and a demand that no laws enacted after the new contract affect its operations were among the issues raised, the source said.The company declined to comment on details of the negotiations. A spokesperson for the government did not reply to a request for comment.Story continuesPanamanian President Laurentino Cortizo said on Monday the government had presented a final contract offer to the company.On Tuesday, lawmakers voted to summon the country's commerce and industry minister and environment minister to answer questions on the company, covering operating permits, royalties, sanctions for environmental offences and the progress of negotiations on the new contract.The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.First Quantum paid $61 million in royalties to Panama's government in 2021, while the Cobre Panama mine posted sales revenues of $3.2 billion for the year, company data showed.Meanwhile, other businesses circle the mine, which started production in 2019. Government records show at least two requests are under review to explore gold and other metals near First Quantum's concession.Both parties have publicly said they want to strike a deal, but their failure to do so before the latest government deadline expired prompted Panama to order a halt to the mine's operations and the company to start arbitration proceedings.LUCRATIVE ASSETIn 2021, Cobre Panama represented more than half of First Quantum's earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). It also accounts for about 3.5% of Panama's gross domestic product.The firm has invested over $10 billion in the mine and paid only nominal dividends to shareholders during its initial years, according to company data.Cobre Panama represents about 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, interacts with some 1,800 suppliers and is the country's biggest private investment, according to business adviser Rene Quevedo, from consultancy GS&amp;S Consultores.Mining was the country's most dynamic sector during 2021, more than doubling in output. Fitch Ratings revised Panama's credit outlook to stable from negative in February, highlighting booming copper exports.The mining row could hamper government plans as Cortizo wants to pump some $190 million from the miner's annual payments into Panama's national pension scheme, which risks running out of funds in 2024, according to the International Labor Organization.""If there's no agreement, the damage would be serious,"" Quevedo said.The company has said the cost of halting operations remains ""uncertain"". Cortizo's government has not disclosed any assessment of how the dispute could affect Panama.Panama's government says it is prepared to face all legal scenarios to defend the national interest.""It's a Panama Canal type of negotiation,"" said Hernan Arboleda, director of public policies at the economy and finance ministry, pointing to the country's experience in negotiating with the United States to secure control of its famous waterway.""Panama can demonstrate to international authorities that this is not an equitable contract,"" he told Reuters.(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire; Additional reporting by Milagro Vallecillos; Editing by Dave Graham; Marguerita Choy and Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

We're watching Las Vegas Sands as well. Both of them are higher after being upgraded over at Wells Fargo. In the case of Wynn, it's being upgraded to overweight from equal weight, this coming as Macau's reopening spreads some optimism for these casino stocks. And you got to love when we're looking at the title of this Wynn note-- ""We need more Ma-cow bell,"" according to analyst Daniel Pulitzer. Hats off to Daniel Pulitzer for that word play.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, look at that, Daniel, who's the CFA, making those jokes. Usually you don't get a lot of humor out of CFAs. No offense, of course, to our friend, Sam Ro, who's amazing. He's a CFA and a very rich sense of humor. But this is another stock, I would say, is a bull call, looking for Wynn to recover all of its adjusted operating profits this year, as it had in 2019. So that is a big call, in large part, hinged to the reopening of Macao, that key market for Wynn and many other casinos.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and this-- I mean, with the China travel restrictions that have really been pulled back and quite rapidly and questionably so in many of the instances, given the number of cases that are continuing to rise in the spread of COVID, it is still coming with where the reaction from other countries and the travel that goes into that region, where that is still going to hold up, and the consumer appetite for people actually traveling there, too.And so that is going to be a major part that this story or even this call really hinges on, is the number of travelers that are still willing to go to those casino experiences as well. But this one potential boon on the day for at least the stock here right now.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and the analysts also in this call on Las Vegas Sands, which they were already overweight and remaining overweight, saying we see Macao evolving as the most compelling growth story in gaming. There is some talk and chatter out this morning that perhaps the China cases are peaking or going to peak. And once they're on the downslope of that, perhaps we'll start to see a little bit of a smoothing out of what has been a very, very rocky reopening practice there.Story continuesEven now, you see we're still seeing stories about how the crematoria in China are full, that some of what we saw in the early days of the pandemic here in the United States is now being repeated over there, and in some cases, magnified. So all of that said, the analysts here trying to look past that activity. And it's not just happening with the casinos. We're seeing China stocks that trade here in the US broadly rally. Alibaba, for example, is one of the stocks that's trading higher today.And you can see the rally in other-- Pinduoduo is up by 9%, JD.com up almost 6%, Alibaba up almost 6% and so is Baidu. So this sort of broad rally in China stocks on the renewed optimism, obviously, it's been very fits and starts, both for the actual reopening and the stock movement around the reopening.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, the Golden Dragon Index over the past 52 weeks down 20%, so it will be interesting to watch some of those names to see if they start to chart some type of rebound as we begin 2023.]"

The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.On the flip side, Berkshire's name is synonemous with that of Warren Buffett and it is reasonable for investors to be wary of the sustainability of the stock's impressive performance in the post-Buffett period, whenever that is.

The company is facing commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. Also, it issued a drab fiscal 2023 view due to inflation, higher freight and currency woes.However, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines in the quarter, wherein revenues beat estimates for the 10th straight time.

By comparison, an individual stock is unlikely to match market returns - and could well fall short. For example, that's what happened with NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) over the last year - it's share price is down 25% versus a market decline of 22%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 14% in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 23% in the last three months.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for NRG Energy While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unfortunately NRG Energy reported an EPS drop of 21% for the last year. We note that the 25% share price drop is very close to the EPS drop. Therefore one could posit that the market has not become more concerned about the company, despite the lower EPS. Rather, the share price is remains a similar multiple of the EPS, suggesting the outlook remains the same.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, NRG Energy's TSR for the last 1 year was -23%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 23% received by NRG Energy shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.NRG Energy and OGE Energy are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NRG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.NRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 2.86, while OGE has a forward P/E of 18.40. We also note that NRG has a PEG ratio of 0.24. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. OGE currently has a PEG ratio of 3.68.Another notable valuation metric for NRG is its P/B ratio of 1.46. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, OGE has a P/B of 1.78.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to NRG's Value grade of A and OGE's Value grade of C.NRG stands above OGE thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that NRG is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We also believe in providing transparency on our approach to managing climate-related impacts across our business and operations.Our goalsNRG is targeting a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2025, from our current 2014 baseline, and net-zero emissions by 2050. Our goal covers NRG's direct emissions (scope 1), its purchased energy (scope 2), and the employee business travel portion of scope 3. We are proud to have had our emissions reduction targets approved by the SBTi - first in 2015 and more recently in March 2021 when our current goal was declared to be 1.5°C-aligned, the most ambitious designation then available and what the latest climate science has told us is needed to prevent the most damaging effects of climate change. NRG is the first, and currently the only, power company in North America to achieve this designation and among only twelve globally at the time of certification.To further strengthen our sustainability commitments, in 2021 NRG added a new sustainability goal to achieve 100% electrification of our light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030. As part of this goal, we joined the Climate Group's EV100, a global initiative which brings together companies committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030.The path to one and a half:50% carbon emissions reduction by 20251net-zero carbon emissions by 2050100% electrification of our vehicle fleet by 2030ProgressFrom the current 2014 baseline to 2021, the company's CO2e emissions decreased from 61 million metric tons to 34 million metric tons, representing a cumulative 44% reduction, or the equivalent of avoiding nearly 68 billion miles driven by an average passenger vehicle. The decrease is attributed to reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation and a market-driven shift away from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas. As compared to 2020, the increase in emissions in 2021 was primarily due to higher power demand which was a result of the easing of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the associated economic recovery. We are continuing to target a 50% reduction by 2025 and are on track to meet that goal. NRG's Annual Report on Form 10-K also discusses NRG generation from all fuels represented in our portfolio - natural gas, coal, nuclear, oil, and renewables.Story continuesIn 2021, 9.2 TWh or 17.6% of NRG's power generation was from nuclear and renewables and therefore had zero emissions.To learn more about NRG Energy's commitments to a sustainable future, download the 2021 Sustainability report here1 Scope 1, 2, and the employee business portion of Scope 3, relative to current 2014 baseline.NRG Energy, Tuesday, January 3, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: http://www.nrg.com/sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733785/NRG-Energy-2021-Sustainability-Report-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions]"

The stock has declined 22.1% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why NRG Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of NRG shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 26.75. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for NRGThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering NRG in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 33.9% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, NRG currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 32%. That's well below the market decline of 22%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 6.6% in the last three years.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for Synchrony Financial While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately Synchrony Financial reported an EPS drop of 11% for the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 32% share price fall. This suggests the EPS fall has made some shareholders are more nervous about the business. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 4.61.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Synchrony Financial's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Synchrony Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, Synchrony Financial shareholders did even worse, losing 30% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.0% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Synchrony Financial (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the acquisition, exploration, evaluation, and development of precious metal properties in Morocco. The company’s loss has recently broadened since it announced a US$307k loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$2.3m, moving it further away from breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Aya Gold &amp; Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. View our latest analysis for Aya Gold &amp; Silver Consensus from 4 of the Canadian Metals and Mining analysts is that Aya Gold &amp; Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2023, before generating positive profits of US$54m in 2024. So, the company is predicted to breakeven just over a year from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 86% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthGiven this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Aya Gold &amp; Silver's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Aya Gold &amp; Silver currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making metals and mining company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are too many aspects of Aya Gold &amp; Silver to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Aya Gold &amp; Silver's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of pertinent aspects you should look at:Valuation: What is Aya Gold &amp; Silver worth today?

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the World.Nickel production started globally in 1824 through cobalt blue production while the first large-scale production began in 1848 in Norway. The demand for nickel increased in the late 19th century and its production started to make progress in the early 20th century with the discovery of the metal in Canada, Russia, and South Africa. Currently, Indonesia is the country with the largest nickel reserves at 21 million metric tons out of the global 95 million metric tons of reserves (1 ton = 2000 pounds, 1 tonne, or metric ton = 2,240 pounds).Significance in the EV market and Other UsesThe first common use of nickel was to make coins. However, it is fast becoming one of the most important components in EV batteries. According to BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), the demand for nickel will increase 4x in the next 30 years due to the rise of the EV industry. The company’s 85% of the nickel sulfate production is used in batteries. According to a Reuters report, there is enough lithium and nickel to power 14 million EV batteries in 2023 and the number is expected to reach 21 million EVs globally by 2025. Between 2021 and 2030, the global EV market is expected to show a CAGR of 18.2% and reach $823.75 billion by 2030. Global EV sales were recorded at 2 million in 2020, which increased by over 100% to 4.2 million in 2021.Apart from the EV industry, the aerospace and defense industry is another prospect for nickel market growth. Nickel alloys are used by the aerospace and defense industry for turbines of jet engines, exhaust valves, thermostat valves, tanks, and piping due to nickel’s heat-resistant nature and metal integrity.The most common use of nickel is in stainless steel production. Over 66% of the global nickel ore is used to produce stainless steel for kitchen equipment, chemical industries, metallurgy, and several other industries.Story continuesNickel Market History, Growth, and FutureNickel reached its peak per tonne price in April 2007 at $50,000 mainly due to low inventory levels. After its 2007 peak, the industry saw a decline over the years to approximately $8,100 in May 2016. In the current year, the metal peaked at $48,000 in March before recording the lowest level of $21,100 in September. Currently, Nickel is trading at $30,234. In March 2022, the metal price went up to $100,000 for a few moments, which will be discussed later.The average nickel price in the first three quarters of 2022 was $25,684 per tonne which was 43% higher than in the same period of 2021. In addition, at the end of September, the nickel stocks on London Metal Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange amounted to 55,080 tonnes, compared to 161,570 tonnes at the end of September 2021.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global nickel market was worth $33.31 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $59.14 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period. According to the report, stainless steel used by the automotive, consumer goods, and construction industries will be the primary growth driver for the metal’s price and demand.Some of the biggest nickel mining companies include OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel (LSE:MNOD), Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), and Glencore plc (OTC:GLNCY).Chaos in MarchOn March 8, the nickel prices surged by 66% within a day to $48,078 at 5:42 am. Later on, the prices saw a sudden surge of 250% to over $100,000 per tonne around 6 a.m. The main reason for this sudden price hike was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The prices spread mayhem in the market as there was a giant short position held by Xiang Guangda, the founder of Tsingshan Holding Group.The Russian invasion led to sanctions on the country which spread the fear that the world’s third-largest producer’s nickel might be banned in Europe, causing the supply deficit to be much greater than the demand. The short position held by Xiang Guanda led him to hot waters as his firm had to pay $10 billion due to margin calls. However, to curb the situation, the London Metal Exchange stopped the trade for a couple of hours which brought the price back to $48,000 per tonne levels.10 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyAfter an assessment of the nickel industry and the biggest nickel mining companies, we chose the 10 biggest nickel mining companies.

But given that inflation is still trending well above the Fed’s target range, markets remained on edge.A slew of U.S. data this week is also expected to shed more light on the world’s largest oil consumer, starting with manufacturing activity data for December due later in the day. Nonfarm payrolls data for December, due on Friday, is also expected to provide more insight into the jobs market.Traders fear that a sustained rise in U.S. interest rates could weigh on economic activity and potentially trigger a recession in 2023- a scenario that is negative for crude demand. The prospect of a recession triggered wild swings in oil prices through 2022, and is expected to cause more volatility in the near-term.Concerns over a delayed economic recovery in China were also heightened after President Xi Jinping struck a more cautious tone than expected during his new year's address.

However, no agreement was forthcoming, prompting the two sides to raise the stakes to protect their interests in the mine, known as Cobre Panama.The dispute, which began at the end of 2021, has become a litmus test of Panama's ability to remain attractive to business even as the government seeks to reduce inequality by reviewing longterm deals that many analysts regard as too generous to business.""Cobre Panama is the only metal mine operating in the country and many foreign companies started operations in Panama with its arrival. What happens will have a huge impact that seems to have not been properly weighed by both parties,"" said Zorel Morales, director of Panama's mining chamber.Failure to reach a deal could spook foreign investors at a time when Panama is looking to develop three other copper deposits that could bring in investments similar to Cobre Panama's, said Morales.Panama's demand that the company pay at least $375 million in annual tax has been at the center of the dispute, and during last week's talks First Quantum raised points it wanted included in its contract after a Dec. 14 deadline to reach agreement expired, according to a source linked to the government.Exclusive rights to explore other minerals, enlarge the area of its concession, a $1 billion tax credit for its investment and a demand that no laws enacted after the new contract affect its operations were among the issues raised, the source said.The company declined to comment on details of the negotiations. A spokesperson for the government did not reply to a request for comment.Story continuesPanamanian President Laurentino Cortizo said on Monday the government had presented a final contract offer to the company.On Tuesday, lawmakers voted to summon the country's commerce and industry minister and environment minister to answer questions on the company, covering operating permits, royalties, sanctions for environmental offences and the progress of negotiations on the new contract.The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.First Quantum paid $61 million in royalties to Panama's government in 2021, while the Cobre Panama mine posted sales revenues of $3.2 billion for the year, company data showed.Meanwhile, other businesses circle the mine, which started production in 2019. Government records show at least two requests are under review to explore gold and other metals near First Quantum's concession.Both parties have publicly said they want to strike a deal, but their failure to do so before the latest government deadline expired prompted Panama to order a halt to the mine's operations and the company to start arbitration proceedings.LUCRATIVE ASSETIn 2021, Cobre Panama represented more than half of First Quantum's earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). It also accounts for about 3.5% of Panama's gross domestic product.The firm has invested over $10 billion in the mine and paid only nominal dividends to shareholders during its initial years, according to company data.Cobre Panama represents about 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, interacts with some 1,800 suppliers and is the country's biggest private investment, according to business adviser Rene Quevedo, from consultancy GS&amp;S Consultores.Mining was the country's most dynamic sector during 2021, more than doubling in output. Fitch Ratings revised Panama's credit outlook to stable from negative in February, highlighting booming copper exports.The mining row could hamper government plans as Cortizo wants to pump some $190 million from the miner's annual payments into Panama's national pension scheme, which risks running out of funds in 2024, according to the International Labor Organization.""If there's no agreement, the damage would be serious,"" Quevedo said.The company has said the cost of halting operations remains ""uncertain"". Cortizo's government has not disclosed any assessment of how the dispute could affect Panama.Panama's government says it is prepared to face all legal scenarios to defend the national interest.""It's a Panama Canal type of negotiation,"" said Hernan Arboleda, director of public policies at the economy and finance ministry, pointing to the country's experience in negotiating with the United States to secure control of its famous waterway.""Panama can demonstrate to international authorities that this is not an equitable contract,"" he told Reuters.(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire; Additional reporting by Milagro Vallecillos; Editing by Dave Graham; Marguerita Choy and Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Now.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, meaning that demand for semiconductor products fluctuates in regular intervals. This is due to the fact that semiconductor products are closely tied to the broader technology industry, which also experiences cyclicality. Demand for semiconductor products tends to rise when the overall economy is doing well, as businesses and consumers purchase more technology products. On the other hand, when the economy is in a recession, semiconductor demand tends to fall.The semiconductor industry has had its fair share of volatility. First was a global shortage amid the Covid-19 pandemic, triggered by increased consumer spending on personal computers and devices as consumers were forced to stay indoors. The shortage turned into a glut as manufacturers hoarded chips, we did a piece about this. You can go to 10 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch as Shortage Turns to Glut if you want to read about that.Global Semiconductor Revenue to Go Down by 3.6% in 2023According to a report by Gartner, the worldwide semiconductor revenue is on track to go down by 3.6% in 2023 and amount to $596 billion, down from $618 billion in 2022. The Vice President of Gartner, Richard Gordon, said:“The short-term outlook for semiconductor revenue has worsened. Rapid deterioration in the global economy and weakening consumer demand will negatively impact the semiconductor market in 2023.”Moreover, memory revenue is expected to decline by 16.2% in 2023. This is driven by demand destruction for PCs, smartphones, and consumer electronics, and an oversupply of chips in these markets.Wedbush Analyst Bullish on Semiconductor StocksOn December 23, Wedbush Securities' analyst, Matt Bryson, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network where he gave his take on the situation of the semiconductor sector and what he sees for the space moving forward. According to Matt Bryson, semiconductor companies' margins have suffered because ""there's too much inventory out there, there's still too much supply, and this is what happens when there's not enough demand"". However, Matt Bryson sees an uptick in semiconductor performance soon. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues""The last three, four years, we've seen these mini cycles where you really haven't seen substantial oversupply or substantial undersupply and so earning and margins have held within a relatively narrow range, at least in the history of memory. This looks a lot more like the cycles we saw prior to the last three, four years, where you get substantial oversupply. What ends up happening is the memory companies over correct and so they reduce production, reduce forward Capex and forward production capacity, and then a couple of things happen. One, demand for memory continues to grow, while I believe will happen this time around. Two, as pricing comes down, because the product is cheaper, you see content per device go up. So, PCs start using more memory, servers start using more memory. That's always a little bit unexpected, and what ends up happening is, in some period of time, you end up with not enough supply. And so we see the exact reverse happen of the downtick we just saw. You get an uptrend in pricing, it all flows through into revenue and margins, and all of a sudden earnings look really good.""2022 has been a bad year for stocks, especially growth stocks which include semiconductor stocks. As of January 3, the Nasdaq Composite has shed over a third of its value since the beginning of 2022. However, this massive pullback has caused certain leading names in the semiconductor space to drop to bargain levels.

For our readers, please could you tell us a bit about yourself and your career journey?I come from a large family of LatinX heritage. My parents did not have much formal education, and their English skills were still poor when I was growing up. When I was eight months old, they discovered that I'd probably never be able to see. Both parents felt an overwhelming sense of self-blame, guilt, helplessness and fear for their child. This reaction is almost inevitable given the social stigma, isolation, and misinformation about disabilities in the larger society. Additionally, like many parents from communities of color, my parents knew instinctively that as a Latina and a person with a disability I would experience many layers of barriers to thrive in mainstream society.While a teenager, I was involved in a variety of political/social movements. Experiences in these social justice environments began to shape my sense of purpose in life - meaning that many of my values were formed and I learned a lot about working with different types of people on a daily basis.I had the opportunity to live in Japan for two months as part of a youth exchange program, to travel to Nicaragua to do organizing for disability rights, and to live in Mexico for three years when my partner and I adopted our son. These experiences exposed me to the realities of most disabled people in developing countries: few sidewalks, no transportation, no services, and no awareness of disability as a social issue. The opportunity to get out of the States and experience different cultural values, beliefs and approaches to disability helped me understand my own struggle in the United States where so much emphasis is placed on individuality and independence, and further developed my commitment to disability rights.In 1988, I entered college at San Francisco State University. I became the first in my family to pursue postsecondary education and graduated with a degree in Speech and Communication Studies. Through my experience in community organizing I had found that I was good at connecting people, communicating with people, and I really enjoyed it. I found meaning in bringing about change through bringing people together.Story continuesSubsequently I had many jobs where I was able to advocate for people with disabilities including leading two nonprofits, serving as an Assistant Secretary of Labor and led the disability/accessibility initiatives for Wells Fargo bank and now here I am at Expedia.What about Expedia Group (EG) appealed to you?I was very happy in my previous job position in a disability advocacy non-profit and wasn't necessarily looking for another role. But during my interviews with EG, I was convinced that I wanted to work here. I had travelled a lot in my life and travel is an experience that is very meaningful to me. I knew that joining EG meant helping people with disabilities have better travel experiences and I loved the idea of contributing to EG's mission that travel is a force for good.What impact are you wanting to have as you step into your role as VP, Disability Inclusion?First and foremost, I want people in the travel industry to understand that disability is a natural part of the human condition, and that people with disabilities are travelling more and more. Within EG, I want to build a bench of advocates and allies around disability and accessibility awareness both internally and externally, whether that's towards our employees, travelers, or partners.We are currently at the beginning of launching strategies to make EG more welcoming to people with disabilities. We are, for example, streamlining our accommodations/adjustments processes to offer better interviewing experiences to candidates and equipping our recruiters and Hiring Managers with the tools to effectively recruit and hire people with disabilities. We are also working on Self ID processes to allow employees to safely disclose their disability. On the employee side, we know that the biggest obstacle to disclosing is fear. The more conversations we have around weaving disability into our consciousness, practices and processes, the more people will feel comfortable coming out as being disabled and together we will build a more welcoming workplace and travel experience.What are your thoughts on the current state of travel for people with disabilities?Travel destinations are becoming more and more accessible due to various laws and rules in countries. But there is still a lot of opportunity - we have an aging population with a strong willingness to travel. There is a tremendous opportunity to work with travel partners to identify accessibility features, and share information on properties that offer specific accessibility options, therefore allowing travelers to make better-informed travel decisions.What advice do you have for people with disabilities seeking to advance in their careers?My advice to people with disabilities is to understand that companies are very interested in your point of view and perspective and my advice to companies is that people with disabilities bring so much innovation and creativity to the workforce, which makes us worth hiring.Disability crosses every other identity so it's important that we are able to contribute to and participate in all aspects of the workplace and travel market. As we do, awareness will increase, attitudes will change and people of all abilities will avail themselves of the opportunity that both work and travel offers.We are hiring!

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, CSX Corp. CSX, American International Group, Inc. AIG and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. CNP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Earnings Outlook for 2023, and Featured Reports for Apple, J&amp;J and OthersThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today’s Research Daily features an update on the evolving earnings picture for 2023 and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and CSX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Earnings Outlook for 2023Multiple forces are at play in driving stock prices at any point in time. But the two biggest forces in the long run are interest rates and corporate earnings, with our focus in this note solely on the earnings part.Aggregate bottom-up earnings for the S&amp;P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.2% in 2023 on +2.1% higher revenues. This would follow the +4.7% earnings growth in 2022 on +10.6% higher revenues.Estimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, after peaking in mid-April 2022. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates have declined by -9.4% since mid-April for the index as a whole and -11.8% excluding the Energy sector.Estimates have been cut for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Construction (Negative revision of -29.6% since mid-April), Consumer Discretionary (-21.5%), Retail (-21.2%), Tech (-19.6%), Industrials (-13.8%), Aerospace (-13.7%), and Transportation (-10.2%). Estimates for Energy, Utilities, Autos and Basic Materials have modestly increased.Story continuesThe future course of revisions will depend on how the underlying economic outlook unfolds in response to the Fed tightening cycle.I am of the opinion that a relatively benign outcome for the U.S. economy where it is able to dodge a nasty recession will be consistent with an earnings outlook that is roughly in-line with current earnings estimates.I am not suggesting that estimates do not need to come down further. But rather than aggregate estimates outside of the Energy sector already down by almost -12% since mid-April, there may not be a whole lot of further room to fall as long as the economic outlook doesn't materially deteriorate.Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Apple have declined -27.9% over the past year against the Zacks Tech sector's decline of -37.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -20.9% pullback. The Zacks analyst believes that Apple’s holiday season iPhone shipments are expected to suffer from disruptions at its Chinese partner Foxconn’s factory in Zhengzhou. We expect Apple to ship roughly 70 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The company expects year-over-year revenue growth to decelerate in the fiscal first quarter compared with the fiscal fourth quarter due to unfavorable forex. Mac revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by forex. Apple expects Mac revenues to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter.Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Nevertheless, a growing subscriber base in the Services business and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +3.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +12.3%. The Zacks analyst believes that J&amp;J’s sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW, Sandstorm Gold Ltd. SAND, Graco Inc. GGG and The Mosaic Co. MOS.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes at the Turn of the YearA brutal 2022 has seen several stocks bleed, and as the year comes to a close, investors are expecting several headwinds in the coming months too. Markets have been suffering on Fed's indication that interest rates will continue to rise through 2023. This has made investors worried about an impending recession.The Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq are likely to close the year down 8.6%, 19.2% and 33%, respectively. The multi-year high inflation rate is currently the biggest threat to the U.S. economy. Even though there are recent hints that inflation is slowing down, it is still not under complete control.Multiple Headwinds AheadThe Personal Consumption Index (PCE) data for November, the Fed's favored inflation gauge rose a modest 0.1% in November, less than the consensus estimate. Also, the rate of inflation decreased year over year in November. On a year-over-year basis, inflation increased 4.7% in November after rising 5% in October.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% in November, after climbing 0.3% in the month earlier.This follows the Consumer pricing index (CPI) data for November, which reflected a 7.1% year-over-year rise in inflation, indicating that inflation has slowed substantially from the record highs of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. However, it is still at multi-year highs and the Fed has hinted at further rate hikes in 2023.Market participants also feel that the recent PCE data won't have much of an impact on the Fed's plans to continue with its aggressive rate-hike agenda.Story continuesInvestors are now concerned about how long the Fed will continue with its policy of raising interest rates. Until the Fed indicates a reduction in interest rates, investors believe that trading will remain volatile and stocks will be under pressure.Investors are worried that high-interest rates could not only slow down the economy but also push it into a recession, as inflation is still well above the Fed's target of 2%.Geopolitical concerns have also been impacting markets. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which contributed to a wintertime global oil and gas deficit, is causing supply-chain disruptions.Additionally, the surging COVID-19 cases in China, resulting in the deaths of thousands, and the way Beijing is responding to the situation have also been unsettling markets as investors are concerned about how the lifting of COVID-related restrictions in China will impact global markets and economies.Given this situation, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks at the moment. This is because dividend stocks have the potential to endure market volatility and have a track record of success and a solid business plan.They not only offer a consistent flow of revenues but also minimize the likelihood of frequent price changes. Additionally, during times of market turbulence, dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. Four such companies are Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Sandstorm Gold Ltd., Graco Inc. and The Mosaic Co.Lamb Weston is an Eagle, ID-based company.

To skip the detailed history and progression of nuclear weapons and technology, you can go directly to 5 Countries That Have Nuclear Weapons.HistoryIt was the German scientist Werner Heisenberg that discovered the possibility of nuclear fission chain reactions and the possibility of the nuclear bomb. The first nuclear reactor was built by Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in 1942. It was a breakthrough moment in the history of science and technology and global energy needs. However, the nuclear fission reaction discovery was made during World War II, and the initial use of nuclear power was through weapons of mass destruction.German scientists started working on their nuclear program in 1939. However, the American scientists despite starting late in 1942, created the bomb first. The United States nuclear weapons program was called Project Manhattan and it was initiated in 1942. At its peak, the project had employed 130,000 workers and the US had spent over $2.2 billion on it. Shortly after conducting the first test on July 16, 1945, the US dropped its first bomb on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. Three days later the United States dropped another bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, which led to Japan’s surrender to the United States, thus ending World War II. These two bombs combined resulted in almost 200,000 casualties.Soon after the US, the Soviet Union conducted its first successful nuclear test in 1949. Since then, a nuclear stalemate known as the Cold War took place between the two Super Powers till the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. During this period, the world came close to a nuclear war once in 1962. The event is known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The crisis was initiated when the US discovered USSR installed nuclear weapons in Cuba.Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear WeaponsThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was a global act enforced in 1970. The objective of the treaty was to limit the number of global nuclear weapons and eventually disband them. The treaty also promotes energy generation through nuclear power and 191 countries have ratified it so far. According to the treaty, only five countries are recognized as nuclear-weapon states. Despite that, four other countries have their own nuclear weapons as of 2022.Story continuesFurther down the line, the United States and Russia signed the New START Treaty in 2010 in Prague. The treaty limits the deployment of strategic nuclear warheads by both countries to 1,550. The countries were supposed to meet the central limits by 2018. However, the treaty has been extended to 2026.As of 2022, nine countries have nuclear weapons and a combined stockpile of 12,700 warheads. Russia and the United States control over 90% of them. The global nuclear weapons stockpile reached its peak at over 70,000 warheads in 1986. Over 40,000 of them belonged to the Soviet Union.Nuclear Use for Peaceful PurposesApart from weapons of mass destruction, nuclear energy can be used in several industrial sectors including energy, healthcare, agriculture, food preservation, industry, and research. As of 2022, 30 countries are generating electricity through nuclear power. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, global electrical capacity through nuclear power technology is expected to grow by more than 100% by 2050 to 873 gigawatts net electrical (GWe). Nuclear energy is one of the significant resources in the global race against climate change as it provides clean energy. Since 1950, nuclear energy has been helpful in avoiding more than 20% of global carbon emissions.Economic POV of Nuclear EnergyAccording to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the average cost of generating 1 megawatt-hour of electricity through nuclear power was $29.13, which was 38.9% less than the 2012 costs. Furthermore, the US nuclear industry generates approximately $60 billion in revenue per annum and has created more than 100,000 jobs. On top of that, the nuclear industry pays $2.2 billion in taxes each year.Although a German study by DIW Berlin suggests, due to high-construction costs and intensive labor, each 1000 MW nuclear reactor incurs a loss of €4.8 billion. The study took the construction of 674 nuclear power plants built since 1951 into consideration.Nuclear energy programs might be expensive and uneconomical for countries. However, the maintenance of nuclear bombs and production of their delivery vehicles/devices cost a fortune and bring good luck to the defense companies. To put things into perspective, The B-52H Stratofortress bomber created by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) costs around $42.9 million each. Moreover, Minuteman III missile and silo costs around $33.5 million each. The submarine-based delivery costs the most and one Ohio-class Trident submarine costs $1.9 billion. The submarine is produced by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). These figures are estimated in 1996 dollars as the most accurate atomic audit was published in 1998. The global nuclear weapons spending was estimated at $82.4 billion in 2021.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are some of the big players that are involved in nuclear weapon production. In 2021, $26.54 billion of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s $62.286 revenue came from the company's defense, space &amp; security segment.Moreover, the global nuclear power plant equipment market generates a sizable revenue for the handful of companies in the market. The market size was worth $32.44 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $38.82 billion by 2030. Furthermore, the Uranium ETFs have shown significant growth in the September quarter of 2022, with Global X Uranium ETF and Uranium Miners ETF growing by 30% and 43%, respectively. Companies like Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) and Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) are currently dominating the nuclear energy market. 15 Countries That Have Nuclear Weapons Or Nuclear Power TechnologyOur MethodologyAfter thorough research, we compiled a list of 15 countries with nuclear weapons or nuclear power technology. Countries are listed according to the number of nuclear warheads they have, including the countries with the US shared nuclear weapons as a part of the NATO Nuclear Deterrence policy. Iran and South Korea make it to the list due to their capability and aspiration towards achieving nuclear weapon technology, along with their fast pace of developing nuclear power technology. The data on the number of warheads was taken from the data collected by the Federation of American Scientists.15 Countries That Have Nuclear Weapons Or Nuclear Power Technology15. IranNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: N/AIran has always been considered a country on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, which is why it has been imposed with billions of dollars of sanctions. In 2015, Iran became a part of the nuclear deal with the global powers including the US and was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. According to the deal, Iran agreed to knock down its nuclear weapons program and allow comprehensive inspections in return for sanctions relief. However, Iran restarted its nuclear weapons activities after former US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal.Iran has caches of enriched uranium which can be further enriched to make nuclear weapons. Since Iran limited International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspection, it is still unknown how much nuclear weapons material Iran has. Nonetheless, the estimates point to enough material to develop five warheads in one year. In spite of that, Iran has denied its plans to develop nuclear weapons and claims that its program is for peaceful purposes only.Currently, Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant produces 2% of the country’s electricity and it is believed that the country has several underground facilities. Earlier in September, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami said that the country is planning a $50 billion nuclear energy project that is expected to generate 10,000 megawatts of electricity.14. South KoreaNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: N/ASouth Korea does not have any nuclear weapons or weapons-grade nuclear material. However, the country is one of the top producers of nuclear energy. It has 25 nuclear reactors that produce over 24,000 MW of electricity. Additionally, three more reactors are under construction that will produce over 4,000 megawatts of electricity.South Korea is also an exporter of its nuclear energy technology. South Korea’s first export deal was the Barakah nuclear project in UAE. South Korean state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp won the $40 billion deal in 2009. As of September 2022, 3 units of the Barakah power plant are operational and the last one is in the final commissioning stages.Korea was one of the hosts of nuclear warheads between 1958 to 1991.  At one time there were almost 950 US nuclear warheads in South Korea. South Korean people are especially in the favor of their country acquiring nuclear weapons. According to a poll, 71% of South Koreans want their country to develop nuclear weapons.13. NetherlandsNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 10-20 (Shared by the US)the Netherlands, as a NATO member holds 10-20 nonstrategic US warheads according to the NATO nuclear-sharing policy. The country doesn’t possess any nuclear weapons of its own. The Netherlands has held US nuclear weapons since 1960.The Netherlands generates a small amount of nuclear energy from its sole nuclear reactor. The government is planning to build two new reactors, to be completed by 2035. The new units are expected to generate 13% of the country’s electricity. 12. BelgiumNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 10-20 (Shared by the US)Belgium does not have any nuclear weapons of its own, but it does host US nuclear warheads as a NATO member country. Currently, it is estimated that Belgium has 10-20 U.S. non-strategic gravity B-61 warheads in its Brogel air base.Belgium has been using nuclear energy for power generation since 1974. As of 2022, the country has 6 nuclear reactors that generate over half of the country’s electricity. Belgium wants to eradicate nuclear power generation in its country and is expected to get rid of it by 2035. In 2021, 50.8% of the country’s total electricity generation was nuclear-powered.11. GermanyNumber of Nuclear Warheads: 15 (Shared by the US)Germany has 15 nuclear warheads shared by the United States as part of the NATO Nuclear Deterrence strategy. In 1954, Germany was prohibited to develop or possess any kind of weapons of mass destruction and is an advocate of global nuclear stockpile reduction and supports initiatives such as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Nevertheless, it has not yet ratified the treaty as the country believes that it would go against NATO’s nuclear deterrence policy. In Germany, the public leans more toward returning the US nuclear weapons and staying off of them.In Germany, political movements had already started against the dangers of nuclear weapons and energy, and the movements were primed in 1998. Germany’s last nuclear reactor was constructed in 2002. As of October 2022, Germany has 3 operable nuclear reactors that generate around 6% of the country’s total electricity and 30 reactors have been shut down.Germany used to generate around 25% of its electricity from nuclear power until 2011. After the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, the country decided to phase out its nuclear energy programs quickly as possible. Germany had planned to shut down all of its nuclear power plants by 2022. However, due to the energy supply deficit created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country is planning to let its last three units remain open till April 2023.10. TurkeyNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 50Turkey has ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, yet it hosts around 50 US-shared nuclear weapons. Turkey’s energy needs are largely dependent on imports, which is why the country is leaning towards nuclear power generation.As of 2022, there are four nuclear reactors under construction in Turkey with a capacity of almost 4500 MWe. The country's first nuclear unit is expected to be operable by 2023.9. North KoreaNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 40 - 50North Korea signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but it withdrew from the treaty in 2003. The country conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006 at the Punggye-ri site. The weapon had an estimated 1 kiloton yield. However, the weapon tests North Korea conducted in 2017 had a yield of over 140 kilotonnes. It is estimated that North Korea’s Hwasong-17 has a range of over 15000 kilometers or 9320 miles. The general consensus is that North Korea has a stockpile of 20 warheads, but it is believed that the country might have 40 - 50 nuclear warheads.Since 2018, North Korea had no operational nuclear reactors to generate power. Nevertheless, the country has seemingly restarted its previous 5MW nuclear reactor located in the Yongbyon complex in 2021.8. IsraelNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 90Israel has never accepted or denied the claims that the country possesses nuclear weapons. However, it has been acknowledged by sources that it indeed has nuclear weapons. It is estimated that Israel has a stockpile of 90 nuclear warheads. In 1979, a double flash of light was detected by the Vela satellites controlled by the United States on Prince Edward Island of South Africa. It is believed that it was a nuclear test conducted by Israel and South Africa. Furthermore, In 1986, The Israeli nuclear technician and whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu revealed information about Israel’s nuclear weapons program. He was later brought back to Israel and sentenced to 18 years in prison.As of 2022, Israel has no nuclear power plants, but the country is considering construction and generating nuclear energy.7. IndiaNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 160Operation Smiling Buddha made India the sixth country to possess a nuclear weapon. The country’s nuclear program started pre-partition in 1944 and launched its first nuclear test on May 18, 1974. The test was mostly kept a secret as India knew the consequences of being the first country outside the five permanent members recognized under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. There was a severe backlash from the international community after the test. The United States immediately blocked aid toward India and imposed several sanctions. As of 2022, India has a stockpile of 160 nuclear weapons.As of 2022, India has 22 nuclear reactors that generate over 6.7 Gigawatt of electricity. It is planning to build additional 11 reactors which are expected to have a capacity of generating 8.7 GWe. Nuclear power is India’s fifth largest source of power generation.6. PakistanNumber of Nuclear Warheads in 2022: 165To acquire nuclear energy, Pakistan started to acquire knowledge and created institutions to gain advancement in nuclear technology for scientific and industrial use. By 1964, the country created the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and the Pakistan Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology. In 1974, Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan came to Pakistan with designs for Uranium enrichment technology, which is believed to be stolen. During the same time, former Pakistan Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had signed a secret agreement with China’s Mao Zedong to get help in developing nuclear weapons.By 1985, Pakistan had achieved weapons-grade uranium advancement and successfully conducted its first test on May 28, 1998.  Between May 28 and 30, the country conducted six successful tests. As of 2022, Pakistan has approximately 165 nuclear warheads.Around 8% of electricity in Pakistan is generated through nuclear energy. In May 2021, Pakistan’s sixth nuclear power plant started its operations and it was built with the help of China.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, David Perry, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$394 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$546, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 25% of David Perry's stake. The only individual insider seller over the last year was David Perry.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

Northrop Grumman insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$143m based on the recent share price.

The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. Moreover, LMT’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft with advanced technologies and enhance its capabilities to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for its Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 68% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2021.Lockheed Martin has delivered 841 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 271 jets in backlog till September 2022.

This, in turn, should bolster LMT’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft arena.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to further reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion.

(NYSE:NKE) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 32.5x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.NIKE hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for NIKE peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on NIKE.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, NIKE would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 8.0%. Regardless, EPS has managed to lift by a handy 23% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 13% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why NIKE is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that NIKE maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.A lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

Unfortunately, the turbulence will linger in early 2023 as recession fears remain entrenched until a meaningful U-turn in monetary policy. Tech stocks are cyclical in nature, and market movements will disproportionately affect them in both directions. This means the trough is always the best time to look for tech stocks to buy, and 2023 will be no different.We may already be in a recession, but there is no telling whether or not the worst is behind or in front of us. However, there are some arguments for why it may not be all doom and gloom for the stock market. First, the stock market bottoms out six months before the economy does. If we look at 2008, the recession was officially declared a year after it began. By that time, the S&amp;P500 was already &gt;40% down, and it only went down another 14% before rallying.Second, last year’s selloffs have turned many tech stocks into value stocks. A further downturn will not be as severe for these stocks already changing hands at a hefty discount. Instead, we may see many tech stocks surge in late 2023 or early 2024 once the Federal Reserve reverses its monetary policy.

The company is currently trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 8x after a selloff that began in April last year, now down 62%.The current valuation of the company looks very compelling. Intel’s long-term growth is expected to come from its data center business. These fast-growing data centers are significant consumers of Intel’s processors and are expected to increase their spending on CPUs. As the cloud and data segment delivers robust growth, Intel is set to benefit from the increased demand in the long run. Its partnership with Mobileye is also making it benefit from the expansion of self-driving cars.Furthermore, Intel’s stock is a good bet for investors looking for tech stocks to buy during the next market rebound, as the firm has been hit disproportionately hard by the selloffs. This is due to Intel having difficulties competing with its 2021 figures. However, as 2023 comes around, Intel will likely turn a corner and start growing once more investors realize the long-term value of this stock.Cloudflare Inc (NET)An illustration a Cloudflare (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCloudflare (NYSE:NET) provides Internet solutions geared towards privacy. The company sells two main products: CDN and DNS. CDN allows customers to host their websites on Cloudflare’s servers to protect themselves from DDoS attacks and save on bandwidth costs. On the other hand, Cloudflare’s DNS aims to safeguard user anonymity while providing a fast resolver to browse the internet.Cloudflare is still going through an aggressive expansion phase by acquiring new clients, expanding its workforce, and increasing its global reach despite the market downturn. The company’s financials also have remarkable growth despite slowing down. Revenue growth is still hovering around 50%, while losses are narrowing, and sustaining such growth rates will compel investors to pay a significant premium for NET stock as the economy rebounds.Moreover, the CDN market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.0% from 2022 to 2030. This is expected to drive Cloudflare’s revenue and profit as we advance.Tyler Technologies (TYL)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockTyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is a leading enterprise infrastructure software and services provider. The company offers various products, including enterprise asset management, mapping and GIS, public safety, detention management, and court case management systems. The company is now growing its business by acquiring new firms and increasing its product offerings. It has a strong presence in North America and the Caribbean. The company is expected to benefit from the growing demand for infrastructure software in the coming years.Investing in TYL stock is a great opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios, being a global leader in providing software and technology solutions for the public sector while trading 41% down from its all-time high. Investors will resume paying a premium for the stock once the company continues its strong track record of financial performance and growth.First and foremost, Tyler Technologies has an impressive revenue growth rate despite short-term hurdles. Over the past decade, Tyler Technologies has consistently grown its revenue over a double-digit clip. This demonstrates the company’s ability to expand and acquire new customers, as well as its ability to manage its existing customer base effectively.Secondly, Tyler Technologies has a diverse portfolio of products and services, which provides investors with numerous options for diversifying their portfolios. The company currently offers solutions for public sector organizations in finance, human resources, and enterprise resource planning. Tyler Technologies’ solutions are also designed to easily integrate existing systems, allowing customers to reduce costs and increase efficiency.ANSYS (ANSS)an abstract graphic of the earth in the cosmosANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) is a tech company with robust financials. It develops and markets engineering simulation software and services to the automotive, electronics, semiconductors, aerospace and defense, energy, healthcare, and consumer products industries. In the last three years, the company’s revenue has increased at a growth rate of 12.9%, and I expect revenue will continue to increase at a double-digit clip in the long term.Of course, ANSYS’ share price has had a rocky road over the past twelve months, with a 39% decline. However, a closer look at the company’s strong financials and impressive net margin suggest that the stock could be a good long-term buy. ANSYS’ net margin stands at 23.1%, ranked better than 93.31% of 2676 companies in the Software industry. That net margin is still growing while most companies are facing margin compression.Investors also should watch for signs of increased revenue and profits, which could result in a boost in ANSYS’ share price. Its solid financials is enough to prompt a surge once investors start being more aggressive.Fiverr (FVRR)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaFiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a global online marketplace for entrepreneurs and freelancers. The company helps people do graphic and web design, writing and translation, video and voiceovers, coding, marketing, and other services at as low as $5. Fiverr is expanding its business and growing its user base by increasing its marketing activities. The company focuses on developing its user base, increasing revenue, and expanding its global reach. Fiverr is expected to benefit from the growing popularity of its services and the burgeoning freelance industry.FVRR stock is among the worst hit from the tech selloff, which could disturb some investors. However, the company has top-class customer retention and lightning-quick sales growth. Fiverr is narrowing its losses and becoming gig workers’ go-to platform. Once the company fully recovers from its post-pandemic setback, I expect FVRR stock to surge.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a leading online payment company. The company provides online payment and money transfer services to individuals and businesses. Much like Fiverr, PayPal’s stock is down significantly from its previous high. It is also down nearly 43% from its pre-pandemic stock price. However, PayPal is still a highly profitable business, and its top line continues to accelerate while profitability has picked up. The company is a widely used payment method that won’t go out of relevancy due to these short-term hurdles.Overall, PayPal provides a great opportunity for investors to capitalize on its strong growth prospects. With a strong management team, a well-positioned digital payments market, and a growing buy now pay later (or BNPL) and cryptocurrency sector, PayPal is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. The current trough provides an excellent entry point for the stock.Texas Instruments (TXN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockCyclical stocks are prone to selloffs during market downturns. This is because demand for their products experiences a slowdown during recessions. Especially those in the semiconductor space are usually among the worst affected by recession fears. However, they rebound faster and offer a better entry point. Such stocks include Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Broadcomm Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).The semiconductor business is the largest segment of these companies’ overall operations. While this sector has cooled down a lot, it still offers many opportunities going forward as it serves multiple end markets, including communications, industrial, automotive, computing, and the remarkably fast-growing cloud computing market. All of these areas have tremendous potential, and these stocks have fallen significantly in the past few months, making them excellent choices for tech stocks to buy.Moreover, semiconductors are still in high demand, as evidenced by these companies’ robust sales growth. Another plus point is the CHIPS act aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor production. Thus, investors won’t mind paying a higher premium for these stocks once the economy inevitably starts turning its gears again.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA)a pile of credit cardsSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.comInvesting in Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stocks can be smart for any investor looking to diversify their portfolio. Both companies are leaders in the financial industry and have a strong track record of growth and profitability. Many consider both of them to be tech stocks due to their accelerating digital payments system. Thus, if you are looking for safer tech stocks to buy, these two should be on the top of your list as they benefit from rate hikes and are significantly less risky than tech companies that depend on semiconductor sales or ad revenue.Furthermore, both of these companies wield remarkable net margins. Visa’s is over 50%, and its revenue growth is near 19% in the latest quarter. Mastercard does have slightly weaker financials, but the effect on its stock price is negligible, and both move in correlation.Investors can assess each company’s metrics, innovation, and dividend strength to decide which is the better fit for their particular investment goals. However, both companies offer nearly equal potential for investors and are viable investment options.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAnother safe tech stock to buy is IBM (NYSE:IBM). While Big Blue won’t make you a millionaire with outsized returns, it also won’t crash as severely during a recession. This old company has continued to retain many clients who’ll continue to buy services from IBM even during challenging economic conditions, forming an inelastic revenue segment.Moreover, IBM focuses on higher-growth segments such as cloud computing, AI, and the blockchain. These segments have already become the key driver, with the hybrid cloud segment having revenue growth of 15%. In comparison, software and consulting grew at 7% and 5%, respectively. If the trend continues, this company can catch up with the rest of the market in the long run.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers a wide variety of products and services, from books and clothing to groceries and music. It is the leading online retailer and a major player in cloud computing, offering a wide variety of services and tools.Cloud computing is quickly becoming Amazon’s most significant growth driver. It is able to consistently generate strong free cash flow, allowing it to invest in growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders. Even cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) and many governments extensively use Amazon’s servers.Moreover, its primary segment, e-commerce, is facing short-term difficulties. But that’s expected, as many pandemic-driven customers haven’t returned. Once that segment readjusts to a more normal long-term growth trend, I see AMZN stock stabilizing and growing again. The stock is below pre-pandemic prices and is set to deliver strong returns in the long run.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a leader in innovation for decades, and its products are known for their quality and usability. The company’s reputation is simply unshakeable, and when you invest in Apple, you can benefit from its long-term success in the tech industry. The stock has consistently performed well over the years and has seen stellar returns except for the current short-term decline.The company is constantly innovating and creating new products and services. New iPhones every year form a very inelastic revenue segment due to Apple’s closed-loop ecosystem and remarkable customer retention. Moreover, its products are a symbol of prosperity, especially in third-world countries where other luxury products aren’t as popular. This is a definite competitive advantage for Apple that almost no one has.Its financials also reinforce the company’s strength. Both the top and bottom lines expanded by 8.14% and 0.83% in Q3. Furthermore, unlike most other tech companies, Apple relies very little on ad revenue or highly cyclical segments. The company is still hiring, albeit at a reduced pace, and hasn’t announced layoffs. That signals solid fundamentals in these conditions, which is why I think AAPL stock is perfect for investors looking for tech stocks to buy that balance potential upside and risk.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are perfect if you’re looking for more established tech stocks to buy. Microsoft is a leading computer software company offering everything from computer operating systems to business software. It also owns several other tech companies, including LinkedIn, which will help boost its value in the long term. Thus, Microsoft is an excellent long-term tech stock for both beginners and experienced investors. The company’s products, such as Microsoft Office and Windows, are a must for white-collar businesses.Alphabet also offers a wide variety of services, including search, cloud computing, and autonomous vehicles. Alphabet is one of the most innovative tech companies in the world, making it a great long-term investment. The company also owns Google and YouTube, guaranteeing that Alphabet remains relevant for years, if not decades, to come.All in all, they are evergreen investments firing on all cylinders and expanding their top lines. They have both struggled in the short term due to the economic landscape causing ad revenues to shrink and margins to compress, but they won’t disappoint over the long run. Their relevancy will continue to make them grow alongside the economy and trade at a premium.NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comBoth NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are computer hardware companies specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are a critical component in computer gaming, making them solid long-term gaming investments. On top of their computer hardware, both NVIDIA and AMD also offer artificial intelligence (or AI) tools. AI is becoming increasingly important as more companies and services use it. Thus, NVDA and AMD are excellent long-term tech stocks to buy for both gamers and AI experts.Of course, both are down substantially from their previous peaks due to them being very cyclical.Last year, both companies saw profits surge due to a chip shortage. Cryptocurrency miners and scalpers contributed to this shortage by ordering large amounts of GPUs and using them for mining or selling them for more. However, The Ethereum network’s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ‘s fall in value contributed massively to GPU demand plummeting. This has caused an oversaturation of GPUs as miners and scalpers try to sell them, and it is now hurting both companies.For 2023, AMD is the best of the two. The company offers a more diverse product portfolio of computer components. Thus, the current downturn is a great buy opportunity for AMD stock. I recommend NVIDIA if you are a risk-taker.Salesforce (CRM)salesforce stock crm stockSource: ShutterstockSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud computing company focused on customer relationship management (CRM). CRM is a popular business software that helps keep track of sales and marketing efforts. As the tech industry shifts towards cloud computing, CRM is becoming a more cloud-based system. Salesforce had a 57% decline from its peak, which seems oversold for a cloud computing stock.Recent acquisitions and partnerships have made Salesforce an even more attractive option for investors. The company has acquired several smaller businesses that have helped it expand its reach and broaden its portfolio. Salesforce has partnered with companies such as Slack, Google, and Amazon to create a comprehensive platform that can integrate with other services. This has allowed Salesforce to create a robust platform that businesses of all sizes can use.Adobe (ADBE)ADBE stock adobe stockSource: ShutterstockAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a software company focused on graphic design, video editing, and marketing. It makes some of the most popular design software in the world, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Thus, its popularity makes it among the best tech stocks to buy if you are looking for an established company with long-term relevancy.Additionally, Adobe has strong and consistent financial performance, room to grow, and operating efficiencies and share repurchases that should help to improve its financials even further. In Q4 2022, Adobe reported a double-digit increase in revenue and a 0.27% increase in operating income, while its net income decreased by 4.6%. Moreover, the company is more reliant on selling software subscriptions, a growing segment.Not only that, subscriptions provide cash continuously for software that needs very little server-side upkeep. The company also has a cloud segment which could become a significant growth driver in the long run.Tesla (TSLA)Interior of the Tesla Model 3Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comWhile Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) might look like a falling knife to many after its 70% decline from its peak, it is reaching highly oversold territories. The stock might look traditionally overvalued due to its high PE, but investors should remember that its profits are doubling yearly. Its top-line growth is also consistent, near 50% growth. That should justify a much higher premium than its current value.Simply put, Tesla’s financials should not warrant a selloff of this scale lasting too long. It is also by far the most established electric vehicle company in the world. Thus, I highly recommend the stock for 2023 as it offers a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. Once the global economy picks up again, Tesla could surge much higher.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has recovered substantially from its selloff, but it still has a long way to go. The company has not only retained its pandemic subscribers but is now growing again, including a 6% top-line growth. That is impressive, considering not many people are binge-watching Netflix after 2020, and competition is getting tougher for streaming companies.In addition, Netflix is taking smart steps to narrow its losses by introducing ads, cutting headcount, and cracking down on account sharing. That might not be the best experience for some customers, but it is great news for investors as it opens up more revenue sources for the company. Beating expectations by a healthy margin is another major plus.Therefore, despite the strong recovery, the stock still provides an excellent long-term buying opportunity. Its stock price is still 20% below pre-pandemic prices, while its profits have more than doubled since.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on the receiving end of a much harsher punishment than Netflix. That is because Netflix has taken smart steps to improve its profits, but Meta has done little. The biggest concern for investors with this company is its metaverse project. It is not easy to find anyone interested in such a project.Likewise, its metaverse segment is a money pit with little revenue generation. In the first three months of 2022, sales from the Reality Labs segment were only $285 million. That’s $3.67 billion in operating losses.Of course, that’s not a healthy segment, but it also shouldn’t warrant a 68% selloff. Meta owns Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Those four apps generated $9.3 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which puts total operating income at $5.66 billion. That deserves a much higher valuation in the long run.Spotify (SPOT)Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.Source: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.comSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) has seen a turbulent ride since its IPO in 2018. Despite missing analysts’ expectations for ad revenue and subscribers in its most recent earnings report, Spotify has posted some positive numbers. In Q3 2022, the company’s revenue growth was 21.4%, and the company is in a very favorable position to execute numerous catalysts that could drive long-term upside. One is the Euro regaining its strength.Spotify’s paid listeners are roughly two times more profitable than free listeners, and if the company can grow its paid subscriber base, it could bring significant long-term upside. Additionally, the company has much more room to grow in developing countries where it is still not popular.If the company can execute its catalysts, then it could see a significant long-term upside. With the right management and strategic decisions, SPOT stock could become a lucrative long-term investment. Especially once ad revenues recover, Spotify can turn a corner and surge.Tencent Holdings (TCEHY)Tencent stock TCEHY stockSource: ShutterstockTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of the leading tech companies in China and is often overlooked by investors. The company offers a variety of products and services ranging from social media, cloud computing, gaming, fintech, and video streaming. Tencent’s stock has declined more than 73.9% due to regulatory issues and a sluggish zero-covid economy in China. However, as China abandons the policy and reopens, it has surged 67.6%.In the most recent quarter, Tencent reported a 1.6% YoY decline in revenue. However, its cloud services business (Tencent Cloud) is accelerating, ranking top 2 in China’s “Public Cloud Service Market.” Of course, Tencent is not without risk, as it relies heavily on China for growth. However, as China reopens and approves new games, TCEHY is undoubtedly among the top tech stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

188,ab8edfeb-cf2f-3bb3-b428-ee98f91168fe,VFC,2023-01-04,15 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-luxury-companies-world-143723421.html,1672756643,STORY,"['TPR', 'LULU', 'RL', 'LEVI', 'COLM', 'CPRI', 'GIL', 'VFC']","[In this article, we will discuss the 15 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World. You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World.The luxury industry consists of manufacturers of personal luxury goods and companies that sell luxury experiences, such as those in the hospitality business. The demand in this sector is frequently correlated to income levels, especially in developed economies where the primary target market is located. However, in 2022, the global luxury market defied this logic, as it continued to grow under uncertain economic times, as per a report issued by Bain &amp; Company. The luxury sector experienced a sales boom in 2021 following COVID-19, and this trend persisted in 2022. According to Bain, the market for personal luxury products was expected to reach €353 billion by the end of 2022, a 22% YoY rise. Bain also forecasted the global luxury market to grow by 21% in 2022, closing the year at €1.4 trillion.An expanding customer base and the use of a multi-touchpoint ecosystem make the luxury market resilient against economic upheavals. Luxury companies are expanding this ecosystem to the virtual world, with several brands launching their metaverse strategies in 2022. LMVH, home to luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, launched its immersive virtual world at VivaTech, allowing customers to experience its innovations. L'Oréal has been dabbling in NFTs and is even considering adopting crypto as a payment method. Gucci also launched Gucci Town, a Roblox-based online marketplace for virtual clothing and games.Demand from Generation Z is the other main factor driving expansion. Millennials and Gen Z accounted for 72% of the global luxury market in 2022. Explaining the rise in demand from these younger customers, a Morgan Stanley report notes that a rising number of these younger customers have not yet moved out of their parents' houses. When young individuals free up their budget for daily essentials, they are left with more disposable income to spend on wants, which explains the rising demand for luxury items. The RealReal 2022 Luxury Resale Report also finds that, due to the development of a solid resale market, more customers, particularly Gen-Z, are viewing their luxury purchases as investments.Story continuesThe future of luxury corporations thus depends not only on macroeconomic conditions but also on how they can maintain their appeal to the socially and politically active Gen-Z and launch successful omnichannel marketing campaigns.littleny/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe focused more on the luxury clothing space for this article and picked the biggest luxury companies operating in the clothing, apparel, footwear and related industries.15.

Revenue improvement across all three brands with a notable increase in consumer demand, particularly for the Coach business, triple-digit growth in e-commerce, and better than expected pricing, drove margins higher. Looking ahead, we expect Tapestry’s supply chain and SKU rationalization initiatives to continue to deliver margin expansion. Together, with early signs of improved receptivity for the Kate Spade brand, we believe a significant value creation opportunity lies ahead.9. V.F.

The company’s Vans brand is in the midst of a turnaround, investors are fretting over the company’s dividend payment and the search to replace former chief executive officer Steve Rendle continues.The company, also parent to The North Face, Timberland and other brands, has 850 million euros of senior notes coming due in September.But whereas that debt came with an interest payment of just 0.625 percent, the refinancing will come dearly.The Fed ratcheted up its benchmark interest rate seven times last year — going from a range of zero to 0.25 percent to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent — making it much more expensive to borrow money.And since Bloomberg reported last month that VF was considering selling off its Jansport business, analysts have been speculating that the company could dispose of that business as well as other brands, perhaps Kipling and Eastpak as well, and maybe Napapijri, all of which reside in the group’s active portfolio.Tom Nikic, an analyst at Wedbush, said: “Between rising interest rates, the debt raised to finance the Supreme deal, and the company’s recent financial choppiness, they would presumably have to refinance these notes at a much higher interest rate, so they might prefer to divest some non-core assets to raise cash to help pay off the notes at maturity, rather than refinancing the full amount.“If they’re looking to generate $500 million of cash, they’d probably have to sell all four ‘non-core’ active brands — the brands excluding Vans and Supreme —which generate about $700 million of revenue combined, so a 0.7x sales multiple would yield [approximately] $500 million of proceeds,” Nikic said.VF hasn’t been acting so much like the fashion powerhouse it was. But if its refinancing is causing so much angst, one can only assume that other companies are not far behind.Financial sources tell WWD the big banks that typically finance fashion’s mega players are being more cautious, forcing companies to be more creative as they prepare to power out of any consumer slowdown or to just keep the lights on.]"
190,997f4306-d41c-3136-ae11-73eebc6597fb,WFC,2023-01-04,Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) shareholders have endured a 24% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-nyse-wfc-shareholders-120053077.html,1672833653,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), since the last five years saw the share price fall 34%.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years over which the share price declined, Wells Fargo's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 0.1% each year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 8% per year, over the period. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past. The low P/E ratio of 10.65 further reflects this reticence.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Wells Fargo's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Wells Fargo's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Wells Fargo, it has a TSR of -24% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Wells Fargo shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 18% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 20%. Given the total loss of 4% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. Whilst Baron Rothschild does tell the investor ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", buyers would need to examine the data carefully to be comfortable that the business itself is sound. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Wells Fargo better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.09, up 0.93% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $24.13 billion, up 1.22% from the prior-year quarter.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.66% lower within the past month. Pfizer is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Pfizer has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.93 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.99.Meanwhile, PFE's PEG ratio is currently 0.88. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

The study will be conducted in two parts and will enroll nearly 2,300 participants.The CIC vaccine combines NVX-CoV2373, Novavax’s authorized protein-based COVID vaccine, and its investigational influenza vaccine in a single formulation. Management believes that, like influenza, COVID-19 will be a seasonal infection and intends to target both indications through a single formulation.Management plans to announce initial data from this study in mid-2023. Based on this data, Novavax will decide whether to advance these candidates to late-stage development.Shares of Novavax have plunged 92.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 21.0% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe initiation of this study was based on positive data, announced this October, from the phase I/II study on the CIC vaccine. Data from the study proved that the CIC vaccine was feasible, well-tolerated and immunogenic, inducing antibody and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and homologous and heterologous influenza strains in the subjects.Initially, Novavax announced initial results from the phase I/II study of the CIC vaccine candidate back in April 2022. The CIC vaccine exhibited the potential to reduce total COVID-19 and influenza antigen amounts by up to 50% overall. The immune responses were comparable to the standalone influenza vaccine candidate and standalone NVX-CoV2373 formulations.Though management conducted a late-stage study for its influenza vaccine, it had paused the development of the same and prioritized development of its COVID-19 vaccine at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was at large.Story continuesLike Novavax, several other companies like Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA are also developing combination vaccines targeting both influenza and COVID-19 indications.Earlier this month, Pfizer along with partner BioNTech, announced that their mRNA-based vaccine candidate targeting influenza and COVID-19 was granted fast-track designation by the FDA. The vaccine combines Pfizer/BioNTech’s authorized Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine and their investigational quadrivalent modRNA-based influenza vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech are currently evaluating the candidate in a phase I study that was initiated last month.Moderna is evaluating mRNA-1073, its own mRNA-based combination vaccine, in a phase I/II study. mRNA-1073 is a combination of Spikevax (mRNA-1273), Moderna’s approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccine, and mRNA-1010, an investigational flu vaccine currently in phase III development. Moderna’s phase I/II study is evaluating mRNA-1073 to co-administered mRNA-1010 and mRNA-1273 and to mRNA-1010 and mRNA-1273 administered alone.Novavax, Inc. Price Novavax, Inc.

F as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Roche RHHBY, AstraZeneca AZN and Pfizer PFE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:DocuSign is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that provides electronic signature software in the United States and internationally. DocuSign became very popular during the pandemic as it was a great solution to sign documents when not physically present. The company became a go to for many businesses that needed to digitally prepare, sign, act on, and manage agreements.COVID helped the stock surge to $315 from the $80 level and now the stock is trading at $55. From a long-term perspective, current levels look attractive after the company posted a solid earnings beat.More About DocuSignThe company incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It employs over 7,000 people and has a market cap of $11 billion.DocuSign serves enterprise, commercial, and small businesses to whom it sells its products through direct, partner-assisted, and Web-based sales.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Growth, but “F” in Value. The Forward PE is 29 and the stock pays no dividend.2022 Stock SlideDocuSign posted big numbers during the pandemic, beating earnings by triple digit percentages multiple times. The momentum continued until late 2021, when the stock crashed after a disappointing Q4 earnings beat of 26%.For most companies, a beat of that magnitude would be a positive. However, DOCU investors priced in the best possible scenario so when growth appeared to slow, the stock was sold aggressively.2022 has not been kind to investors as the stock continued to slide as earnings disappointed. In June, the company posted a 17% earnings miss. This brought the stock down to pre-pandemic levels.Story continuesEarnings TurnaroundWhile 2022 was very tough, 2023 could be shaping up to be a much better year. Earlier in December, the company posted a 39% EPS beat. This was the biggest surprise to the upside since Q2 of 2021.Looking into the quarter, DocuSign guided Q4 revenues at $637-641M v the $640M expected. The company raised their FY23 revenue guide to $2.49-2.50B v the $2.48B expected.Billings were up 17% y/y, while subscription revenue was up 18% y/y.Estimates RisingAnalysts are starting to take their numbers higher after the most recent quarter. Over the last 30 days, the current quarter estimates have gone from $0.40 to $0.53, or 32% higher. Expectations for next quarter have been lifted as well, with estimates going up by 17%.Looking down the road, estimates continue to tick higher. For the current year, we have seen estimates go from $1.63 to $1.92 over the last month, or 17%. For next year, estimates spiked to $2.15 from $1.80, or 19%.After earnings, analysts for the most part remained neutral on the stock. Multiple firms stuck with the “Hold and “Neutral” ratings. But more recently CitiGroup reiterated its Buy rating and took its price target to $72 from $59. This target is about 30% higher from current prices.The Technical TakeThe stock won't be making a full recovery anytime soon, but the current technical setup is favorable.After posting that 39% EPS beat earlier this month, the stock went from $41 to $61. That is a big move and the stock retraced to the halfway back mark at $51. Sideways trading has set in, but the stock could see a scenario early next year where the stock runs back over the recent highs to the $66 area. This is where the 200-day MA resides and where bulls should target.In Summary2022 is over and it's time to look for beaten down stocks that could bounce back in 2023. After a big earnings beat, DocuSign could be one of those names.Watch for a rally early in the year and if that is sustained, look for bulls to buy the stock up to the 200-day moving average.Bear of the Day:Ford Motor Co. is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles worldwide.The stock is trading near 2022 lows after a handful of earnings misses that has forced analysts to lower estimates. The stock is still well off its pre-COVID lows and investors should be nervous that the stock could break $10.About the CompanyFor is headquartered in Dearborn, MI. The company was founded in 1903 and currently employs over 180,000 people. Ford operates through three segments: Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit.Ford is valued at $46 billion and has a Forward PE of 6. The company holds Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value, but “C” in Growth. The stock has a nice dividend, paying 5%, which should draw investors into the name.Q3 EarningsIn late October, the company reported earnings of $0.30 v the $0.31 expected. Revenue came in light and the company cut their FY22 adjusted EBIT to $11.5BIn the company’s outlook, Ford sees 10% year over year growth in wholesale shipments and higher earnings in North America. In post-earnings comments, the CFO said they are expecting a mild to moderate recession in 2023.EstimatesWhen looking at estimates, we see a slight downward trend across all timeframes.Next quarter is the most concerning for Ford, with estimates falling to $0.24 from $0.49 just 60 days ago. This 50% drop is fairly large and investors might want to stay away from the stock until Ford gets through that quarter.Looking to next year, estimates have fallen from $1.94 to $1.81, or 7%.Technical TakeFord made 2022 lows of $10.61 back in July. From there, the stock rallied to $16 and is now trading under the $12 level.The $16 resistance was the 200-day MA, which has fallen below $14. Sellers will likely show up there on any rally. But before the bulls can even consider that, they must contend with the 50-day at $13 and the 21-day at $12.50.If the sellers show up under $11, the stock will likely break the $10 level and head to the 2019 trading range between $8 and $9. At those prices, the dividend will likely offer support to the stock.In SummaryFord is a popular brand that had a good run during the pandemic. However, a weakening economy and inflationary trends are hurting earnings. The stock will likely face a couple more quarters of pressure so investors should shy away until the environment improves.Additional content:Big Pharma Roundup: FDA Decisions &amp; MoreThis week, the FDA approved Roche’s Lunsumio, a first-in-class bispecific antibody, for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), the most common slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The FDA also accepted Pfizer’s biologics license application (BLA) for a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (MenABCWY). The Japanese regulatory authority approved a combination of AstraZeneca’s immunotherapies, Imfinzi (durvalumab) and Imjudo (tremelimumab), for two cancer types, advanced liver and lung cancer.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approves Roche’s Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab):The FDA approved Roche’s CD20xCD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody, Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab) , for treating relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The accelerated approval is for adult patients who have been treated with two or more lines of systemic therapy. Lunsumio was approved for a similar indication in the European Union earlier this June. Off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy, Lunsumio will help treat patients who do not respond to multiple lines of treatment and help them achieve disease remission. A commercial launch of the therapy is expected in the coming weeks.FDA’s Accepts Pfizer’s Meningococcal Vaccine BLA: The FDA accepted and granted standard review to Pfizer’s biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval of its pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (MenABCWY). The BLA seeks approval of MenABCWY for adolescents and young adults, 10-25 years of age, for the prevention of meningococcal disease caused by five meningococcal serogroups that cause the majority of invasive meningococcal disease: serogroups A, B, C, W and Y. The FDA assigned a standard review to the BLA, with a decision expected in October 2023. A pentavalent vaccine, if approved, can simplify what is currently a complex meningococcal vaccination schedule in the country.Pfizer’s phase III study on hemophilia B gene therapy candidate, fidanacogene elaparvovec, met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint of the study was non-inferiority and superiority in the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of total bleeds post-fidanacogene elaparvovec infusion versus prophylaxis regimen with Factor IX (FIX), administered as part of regular care. In the study, a single dose of 5e11 vg/kg of fidanacogene elaparvovec resulted in a 71% reduction in ABR. Key secondary endpoints demonstrated a 78% reduction in treated ABR and a 92% reduction in annualized infusion rate. Pfizer plans to share this data with regulatory authorities in early 2023.AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi+Imjudo Gets Japan Nod for 3 Cancers: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved AstraZeneca’s dual immunotherapy regimen, comprising PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi plus CTLA-4 antibody Imjudo (tremelimumab), in combination with chemotherapy, for treating unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The MHLW also approved the Imfinzi+Imjudo combination for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Imfinzi plus Imjudo was approved by the FDA for advanced liver and NSCLC cancers in October/November. The Japanese regulatory authorities also approved Imfinzi as monotherapy for unresectable HCC and curatively unresectable biliary tract cancer in combination with chemotherapy.The MHLW also granted approval to AstraZeneca’s BTK inhibitor, Calquence as a first-line treatment for adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (including small lymphocytic lymphoma). Calquence is already approved in Japan for treating relapsed or refractory CLL. It is approved for both treatment-naïve and relapsed or refractory settings in several countries, including the United States and Europe, and also for mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and some other countries.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 0.25% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnIn the last five trading sessions, Novartis rose the most (0.8%), while Roche declined the most (0.9%).In the past six months, Merck rose the most (19.9%), while Roche declined the most (5.8%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here:LLY’s 2023 View, MRK-MRNA Joint Cancer Vaccine Data &amp; More)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

It's the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance today. The stock kicking off the new year on an upbeat note. Look at that. We're looking at gains of just about 5%. Now that coming after Truist upgraded the stock to a buy, making the case that investors seem to be, quote, ""too negative"" on the stock at this point.

I'm looking at some numbers here. 4P, 15, that's very fair. Last quarter, $7 billion revenue, 20% margins. I mean, this is a great kind of business.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.72%.Heading into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 4.42% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 8.46% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.57% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from IBM as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect IBM to post earnings of $3.57 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 6.57%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.49 billion, down 7.24% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. IBM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that IBM has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.45 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.45, so we one might conclude that IBM is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.Meanwhile, IBM's PEG ratio is currently 2.32. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. IBM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.82 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 99, which puts it in the top 40% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Be sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

208,4c4392ae-cc4f-3724-b6b4-975a4123caad,IBM,2023-01-04,Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-international-business-140002536.html,1672754402,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +6.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.32 billion and $59.9 billion estimates indicate -16.2% and +1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corp. HES, Marathon Petroleum MPC, ExxonMobil XOM and Schlumberger SLB.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will These 5 Energy Stocks See Another Bull Run in 2023?The year 2022 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in what was its worst performance in more than a decade. With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight the persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s steepest annual loss since 2008, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with commodity prices soaring to new highs and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the year. The standout performers of 2022 were Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Energy Outperforms Amid CarnageAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the year deep in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while all others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index continued to move higher last year after comfortably topping the S&amp;P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It generated a total return of 58% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7%.Story continuesThe energy market continued to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union putting a price cap on Russian oil exports — even at the cost of their economies — the oil bulls have got a fresh impetus.While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the market’s precariously low level of spare capacity, China’s emergence from its strict COVID-19 restrictions, a stretched-out refining system, plus the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in 2022 and gained approximately 20% last year despite a steep selloff at the end of unseasonal warm weather projections for January. But overall, the commodity’s performance in 2022 was driven by a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat in the United States, high demand in Europe (as the continent reduces its dependence on Russian gas) and strong LNG shipments.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in 2022, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the yearly sectoral gains were Occidental Petroleum, Hess, Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Will these winners maintain their run in 2023 too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.This stock handily outperformed all other companies and was up 117.3% during the period, ranking first on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Occidental continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and benefit from the acquisition of Anadarko, the American multinational might have run out of steam. In particular, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company‘s massive long-term debt of more than $20 billion and exposure to volatile commodity prices could limit further share price gains.Hess Corporation: Hess is a leading global integrated energy company. The company’s E&amp;P activities are concentrated in Denmark, Guyana, Canada, Suriname, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and the United States. Additionally, Hess provides gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs.Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 91.6% last year. Its slew of discoveries in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, is a big positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Guyana is expected to become one of HES’ major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the energy operator’s rising costs and expenses, in addition to its relatively high debt-to-capitalization of 50.9%, can affect its financial flexibility. Finally, the dividend yield of Hess compares unfavorably to most of its peers and the S&amp;P 500.Marathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 81.9% in the past year. MPC’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement, per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the COVID lows, the continued increase in costs over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential for #3 Ranked MPC.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. XOM is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production, to refining and marketing.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 80.3% higher in the last twelve months. ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. With steadily increasing cash flows, XOM recently said that it will now buy back $50 billion of stock through 2024.However, the energy giant’s above-average capital spending program has got investors concerned. Also, the integrated energy major has been witnessing lower oil equivalent production volumes, which might affect the bottom line.Schlumberger: Schlumberger is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ended 78.5% higher in the January-December period. High commodity prices have increased demand for its services in energy markets across the globe. Schlumberger's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength, while its healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well.Additionally, its disciplined capital spending will likely benefit shareholders over the long term. While macro headwinds could still impact SLB’s EPS growth In 2023, it’s still a good investment for those interested in the energy market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

210,5f197ef7-1ae2-343f-b792-f601a9a188e8,MPC,2023-01-04,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-trending-140002793.html,1672754402,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this refiner have returned +3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Marathon Petroleum falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $5.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +345.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -27.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $25.15 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +926.5%. This estimate has changed -13.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.68 indicates a change of -41.6% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -13.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $32.19 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -9.6%. The $171.5 billion and $123.31 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.8% and -28.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.8%. EPS of $7.81 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.43%. The EPS surprise was +14.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

211,b46ceb05-eb66-3855-8f28-e3751749d9c9,MPC,2023-01-04,Will These 5 Energy Stocks See Another Bull Run in 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-energy-stocks-see-another-131901653.html,1672751941,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', '^GSPC', 'XOM', 'OXY', 'HES', 'MPC']","[The year 2022 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in what was its worst performance in more than a decade. With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight the persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s steepest annual loss since 2008, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with commodity prices soaring to new highs and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the year. The standout performers of 2022 were Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES, Marathon Petroleum MPC, ExxonMobil XOM and Schlumberger SLB.Energy Outperforms Amid CarnageAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the year deep in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while all others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index continued to move higher last year after comfortably topping the S&amp;P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It generated a total return of 58% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7%.The energy market continued to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union putting a price cap on Russian oil exports — even at the cost of their economies — the oil bulls have got a fresh impetus.While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the market’s precariously low level of spare capacity, China’s emergence from its strict COVID-19 restrictions, a stretched-out refining system, plus the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in 2022 and gained approximately 20% last year despite a steep selloff at the end on unseasonal warm weather projections for January. But overall, the commodity’s performance in 2022 was driven by a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat in the United States, high demand in Europe (as the continent reduces its dependence on Russian gas) and strong LNG shipments.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in 2022, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the yearly sectoral gains were Occidental Petroleum, Hess, Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Will these winners maintain their run in 2023 too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.This stock handily outperformed all other companies and was up 117.3% during the period, ranking first on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Occidental continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and benefit from the acquisition of Anadarko, the American multinational might have run out of steam. In particular, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company‘s massive long-term debt of more than $20 billion and exposure to volatile commodity prices could limit further share price gains.Hess Corporation: Hess is a leading global integrated energy company. The company’s E&amp;P activities are concentrated in Denmark, Guyana, Canada, Suriname, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and the United States. Additionally, Hess provides gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs.Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 91.6% last year. Its slew of discoveries in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, is a big positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Guyana is expected to become one of HES’ major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the energy operator’s rising costs and expenses, in addition to its relatively high debt-to-capitalization of 50.9%, can affect its financial flexibility. Finally, the dividend yield of Hess compares unfavorably to most of its peers and the S&amp;P 500.Marathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 81.9% in the past year. MPC’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement, per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream. But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the COVID lows, the continued increase in costs over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are negatives in Marathon Petroleum story. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential for #3 Ranked MPC.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. XOM is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production, to refining and marketing.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 80.3% higher in the last twelve months. ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. With steadily increasing cash flows, XOM recently said that it will now buy back $50 billion of stock through 2024. However, the energy giant’s above-average capital spending program has got investors concerned. Also, the integrated energy major has been witnessing lower oil equivalent production volumes, which might affect the bottom line.Schlumberger: Schlumberger is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ended 78.5% higher in the January-December period. High commodity prices have increased demand for its services in energy markets across the globe. Schlumberger's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength, while its healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well. Additionally, its disciplined capital spending will likely benefit shareholders over the long term. While macro headwinds could still impact SLB’s EPS growth In 2023, it’s still a good investment for those interested in the energy market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $20.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Molson Coors shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Molson Coors is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Beverages - Alcohol industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.01 per share to $1.07 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Molson Coors right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(NAPA). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Molson Coors Brewing and The Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that TAP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.TAP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.31, while NAPA has a forward P/E of 27.16. We also note that TAP has a PEG ratio of 3.41. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NAPA currently has a PEG ratio of 4.47.Another notable valuation metric for TAP is its P/B ratio of 0.83. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NAPA has a P/B of 2.15.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to TAP's Value grade of A and NAPA's Value grade of D.TAP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NAPA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that TAP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The figure brought Tesla's 2022 total deliveries to 1.3 million units, up 40% year-over-year but below the company's guidance for 50%.The delivery miss further fueled concerns on the Street on the demand for Tesla's vehicles — a key factor in sending shares spiraling 65% lower in 2022.

Tight supplies kept car and truck prices elevated, even as auto inventory improved in the second half of the year.Toyota Motor Corp has been among those hit acutely by parts shortages, which forced the Japanese company to cut its full-year production target in November.The cutback will lead to the company ceding its spot as the top-selling U.S. automaker in 2022 to GM, which gave up that position at the end of 2021 for the first time since 1931, according to Cox Automotive and automotive marketplace TrueCar.GRAPHIC : U.S. auto sales over the years - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-AUTOS/lgpdkkydqvo/chart.pngGM's 2022 U.S. sales are set to rise 2.3%, while Toyota's is expected to fall 9%, according to Cox Automotive.

But that’s not how it works, there’s only one F-series. In fact Ford hasn’t made corporate clones of its F-Series pickup since 2002 (Remember the Lincoln Blackwood?).Those 640,000+ trucks sold would also make the F-Series the best-selling overall vehicle in America for the 41st consecutive year. Ford says if you lined up every Ford pick-up sold last year it would stretch 2,400 miles, or longer than the driving distance from Los Angeles to Detroit.Ford will also likely have sold around 15K or so F-150 Lightning pickups in 2022 — its first year on sale — and which also brings us to another bit of Ford news.In a leaked report to clients, automotive production research firm AutoForecast Solutions (AFS) predicted the 2nd-gen Ford F-150 Lightnings will go into production starting on August 18, 2025. The report states that the 2nd-gen and 1st-gen Lightnings will be jointly in production for around 4 months before Ford fully transitions to the 2nd-gen platform, which will be the electric only TE1 platform. The current Lightning platform is shared with the regular gas-powered F-150.Sam Fiorani, AFS VP of global vehicle forecasting, had this to say about the Lightning in a phone interview with Yahoo Finance:“The most recent info we have shows that the nex-gen F-series Lightning will go into production in August 2025. In the development of a new vehicle, dates change all the time, but current planning has that date in mind,” Fiorani said.Story continuesFiorani noted that AFS tracks production of vehicles in about 60 countries around the world, so “making sure that these dates are accurate allows our clients — both suppliers and manufacturers — to make sure they know when the market is changing.”Ford may reveal more about its electric plans on February 2, when the company reports Q4 earnings. It will also be the last time Ford will combine results of its gas-powered and electric business lines in its quarterly earnings, as the company plans to break out the division results starting in 2023.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The stock at one point hit its lowest level since August 2020, with investors reacting to a lackluster fourth-quarter delivery figure released on New Year's Day. Tesla was the top-trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform.Tesla saw fourth-quarter deliveries rise 18% sequentially to 405,000, missing consensus forecasts of 418,000. The figure brought Tesla's 2022 total deliveries to 1.3 million units, up 40% year over year but below the company's guidance for 50%.The delivery miss only fueled further concern on the Street on the demand for Tesla's vehicles — a key factor in sending shares spiraling 65% lower in 2022.JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cut his profit estimates and price target on Tesla in the wake of the soft results.Brinkman sees Tesla missing fourth-quarter earnings estimates ($1.19) when it reports later in January. For 2023, Brinkman is now modeling for earnings of $4.60 a share, down from $4.84 previously.The Tesla store is closed at the King of Prussia Mall on December 11, 2022 in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)The analyst's price target moved down to $125 from $150. He continues to rate the stock underweight (sell equivalent).""Beyond the impact to near-term financials, another implication we see from 4Q’s combination of softer than consensus volume and pricing is the impact on the stock’s growth narrative which has allowed many investors to believe the company is likely to grow unit volume at upwards of a ~+50% CAGR [compound annual growth rate] until such time as it is the world’s largest automaker (management outlook is for “Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries”),"" Brinkman explained.

Stocks with high liquidity levels have always been in demand, owing to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should be careful about investing in a stock with a high liquidity level. High liquidity may also indicate that the company cannot utilize its assets competently.Besides having sufficient cash, an investor might also consider a company’s capital deployment abilities before investing in the stock. A healthy company with favorable liquidity may be a profitable pick for one’s portfolio.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — also known as the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also suggest that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — also called the ‘acid-test ratio’ or the ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable.Story continuesCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet current debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.A ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified for the screen:Inter Parfums manufactures, distributes and markets a wide array of fragrances and related products. Inter Parfums continues to see solid momentum in its travel retail business.

224,100c662b-cfbf-3d47-b1c7-6b814c528cfd,PNW,2023-01-04,Estimating The Fair Value Of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-pinnacle-west-110546985.html,1672830346,STORY,['PNW'],"[Does the January share price for Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital The ModelWe have to calculate the value of Pinnacle West Capital slightly differently to other stocks because it is a electric utilities company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%. Compared to the current share price of US$74.6, the company appears about fair value at a 7.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$3.6 / (6.4% – 2.0%)= US$80.6dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pinnacle West Capital as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Story continuesSWOT Analysis for Pinnacle West CapitalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Intuitive Surgical is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Intuitive Surgical compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Intuitive Surgical here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Intuitive Surgical, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 20%, but since then they've fallen to 14%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Intuitive Surgical's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Intuitive Surgical. Furthermore the stock has climbed 88% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.If you're still interested in Intuitive Surgical it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Estimates for Energy, Utilities, Autos and Basic Materials have modestly increased.Story continuesThe future course of revisions will depend on how the underlying economic outlook unfolds in response to the Fed tightening cycle.I am of the opinion that a relatively benign outcome for the U.S. economy where it is able to dodge a nasty recession will be consistent with an earnings outlook that is roughly in-line with current earnings estimates.I am not suggesting that estimates do not need to come down further. But rather than aggregate estimates outside of the Energy sector already down by almost -12% since mid-April, there may not be a whole lot of further room to fall as long as the economic outlook doesn't materially deteriorate.Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Apple have declined -27.9% over the past year against the Zacks Tech sector's decline of -37.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -20.9% pullback.

The ruling was a milestone for Cuban-Americans seeking compensation for Cold-War era asset seizures.""The plantiff is awarded $109,671,180.90 in damages,"" the ruling against Carnival said, while the rulings against Norwegian, Royal Caribbean and MSC - the latest of which was published on Tuesday - saw the plaintiff awarded $109,848,747.87 from each liner.Royal Caribbean in a comment to Reuters said it ""disagree(d) with the ruling and will appeal. Carnival also said it ""strongly"" disagreed and would be appealing, and had engaged in ""lawful travel.""Norwegian Cruise Line declined to comment and MSC Cruises did not reply to a request for comment.Havana Docks sued the cruise lines under the Helms-Burton Act, which allows U.S. nationals to sue over use of property seized in Cuba after 1959.""This is a very important ruling by Judge Bloom. The commercial use of confiscated property in Cuba in violation of U.S. law carries clearly detailed and well-known and publicized legal consequences,"" said Roberto Martinez, attorney for Havana Docks.""The undisputed facts established that the cruise lines collected in excess of $1.2 billion in revenues from their cruises that used the confiscated terminal -- and paid nothing to Havana Docks Corp or the Cuban people,"" he added.The rulings could fuel more lawsuits by Cuban exiles pursuing claims, which according to one estimate are worth $2 billion, over asset seizures under late Cuban leader Fidel Castro.(Reporting by Isabel Woodford and Anthony Esposito; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

236,89401b54-67d7-37a8-9960-01ef5c6dab55,RF,2023-01-04,Is Republic Bancorp (RBCAA) a Great Value Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-bancorp-rbcaa-great-value-144002220.html,1672756802,STORY,"['RBCAA', 'RF-PC']","[The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is Republic Bancorp (RBCAA). RBCAA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.07, which compares to its industry's average of 9.44. Over the past year, RBCAA's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.87 and as low as 8.95, with a median of 11.14.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is RBCAA's P/B ratio of 0.97. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.93. Within the past 52 weeks, RBCAA's P/B has been as high as 1.25 and as low as 0.91, with a median of 1.07.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. RBCAA has a P/S ratio of 2.52. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.76.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that RBCAA has a P/CF ratio of 8.03. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. RBCAA's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.25. RBCAA's P/CF has been as high as 12.95 and as low as 7.51, with a median of 9.16, all within the past year.Regions Financial (RF) may be another strong Banks - Southeast stock to add to your shortlist. RF is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Shares of Regions Financial are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8.55 and a PEG ratio of 0.84 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 9.44 and 1.03, respectively.RF's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 12.16 and as low as 7.77, with a median of 9.09, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.93 and as low as 0.27, with a median of 0.60, all within the past year.Additionally, Regions Financial has a P/B ratio of 1.49 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.93. For RF, this valuation metric has been as high as 1.62, as low as 1.13, with a median of 1.34 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Republic Bancorp and Regions Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that RBCAA and RF is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Performed in 2022Among the major stock exchanges in the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fared the best in 2022, declining just 8.8%. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.The Dow Jones, the 30-stock blue-chip index, had rallied almost 19% in 2021. But higher interest rates (the central banks across the globe tightened the monetary policy), 40-year-high inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty (heightened risk of a recession in the near term) roiled the markets in 2022, with the index slipping into the bear market in September-end. Further, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country, adding fuel to the fire.The outperformance of the Dow Jones index was driven by its exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors performed well last year, with energy being the best performing on the higher oil price. Additionally, industrials gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector received a boost from rising interest rates. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Visa and American Express – that are part of the index.In 2022, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP lost 15.3%, 10.2%, 4.1% and 9.7%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in these quality franchises.Story continuesPerformance in 2022While the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term remain a big headwind. Until now, cooling consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report and strong manufacturing activity suggest that a large part of the economy is holding up well. But higher rates have made borrowing expensive, pushing up the cost of buying a new car or house, increasing the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightening the risk of a recession.Hence, investors are cautious about entering the stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The bank has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of its competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions too.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. It has made substantial progress on this front, having already added more than 230 new branches and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past month.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In August 2022, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company acquired robo-advisor NextCapital. In April 2022, Goldman closed the acquisition of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., while in March, the company closed the buyout of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, the company acquired Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Such inorganic growth efforts will diversify the fee-revenue base and offer top-line stability.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first nine months of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 10.89, which is lower than the industry average of 14.50. Also, its P/B ratio of 1.07 is below the industry average of 1.56.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past seven days for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top-line growth in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #3 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that AXP is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company has formed strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It has also announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(TSE:AYA) Before Long,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-expect-breakeven-aya-gold-110730245.html,1672830450,STORY,"['GC=F', 'SI=F']","[We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc.'s (TSE:AYA) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the acquisition, exploration, evaluation, and development of precious metal properties in Morocco. The company’s loss has recently broadened since it announced a US$307k loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$2.3m, moving it further away from breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Aya Gold &amp; Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. View our latest analysis for Aya Gold &amp; Silver Consensus from 4 of the Canadian Metals and Mining analysts is that Aya Gold &amp; Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2023, before generating positive profits of US$54m in 2024. So, the company is predicted to breakeven just over a year from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 86% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthGiven this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Aya Gold &amp; Silver's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Aya Gold &amp; Silver currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making metals and mining company, which typically has high debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are too many aspects of Aya Gold &amp; Silver to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Aya Gold &amp; Silver's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of pertinent aspects you should look at:Valuation: What is Aya Gold &amp; Silver worth today?

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the World.Nickel production started globally in 1824 through cobalt blue production while the first large-scale production began in 1848 in Norway. The demand for nickel increased in the late 19th century and its production started to make progress in the early 20th century with the discovery of the metal in Canada, Russia, and South Africa. Currently, Indonesia is the country with the largest nickel reserves at 21 million metric tons out of the global 95 million metric tons of reserves (1 ton = 2000 pounds, 1 tonne, or metric ton = 2,240 pounds).Significance in the EV market and Other UsesThe first common use of nickel was to make coins. However, it is fast becoming one of the most important components in EV batteries. According to BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), the demand for nickel will increase 4x in the next 30 years due to the rise of the EV industry. The company’s 85% of the nickel sulfate production is used in batteries. According to a Reuters report, there is enough lithium and nickel to power 14 million EV batteries in 2023 and the number is expected to reach 21 million EVs globally by 2025. Between 2021 and 2030, the global EV market is expected to show a CAGR of 18.2% and reach $823.75 billion by 2030. Global EV sales were recorded at 2 million in 2020, which increased by over 100% to 4.2 million in 2021.Apart from the EV industry, the aerospace and defense industry is another prospect for nickel market growth. Nickel alloys are used by the aerospace and defense industry for turbines of jet engines, exhaust valves, thermostat valves, tanks, and piping due to nickel’s heat-resistant nature and metal integrity.The most common use of nickel is in stainless steel production. Over 66% of the global nickel ore is used to produce stainless steel for kitchen equipment, chemical industries, metallurgy, and several other industries.Story continuesNickel Market History, Growth, and FutureNickel reached its peak per tonne price in April 2007 at $50,000 mainly due to low inventory levels. After its 2007 peak, the industry saw a decline over the years to approximately $8,100 in May 2016. In the current year, the metal peaked at $48,000 in March before recording the lowest level of $21,100 in September. Currently, Nickel is trading at $30,234. In March 2022, the metal price went up to $100,000 for a few moments, which will be discussed later.The average nickel price in the first three quarters of 2022 was $25,684 per tonne which was 43% higher than in the same period of 2021. In addition, at the end of September, the nickel stocks on London Metal Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange amounted to 55,080 tonnes, compared to 161,570 tonnes at the end of September 2021.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global nickel market was worth $33.31 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $59.14 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period. According to the report, stainless steel used by the automotive, consumer goods, and construction industries will be the primary growth driver for the metal’s price and demand.Some of the biggest nickel mining companies include OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel (LSE:MNOD), Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), and Glencore plc (OTC:GLNCY).Chaos in MarchOn March 8, the nickel prices surged by 66% within a day to $48,078 at 5:42 am. Later on, the prices saw a sudden surge of 250% to over $100,000 per tonne around 6 a.m. The main reason for this sudden price hike was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The prices spread mayhem in the market as there was a giant short position held by Xiang Guangda, the founder of Tsingshan Holding Group.The Russian invasion led to sanctions on the country which spread the fear that the world’s third-largest producer’s nickel might be banned in Europe, causing the supply deficit to be much greater than the demand. The short position held by Xiang Guanda led him to hot waters as his firm had to pay $10 billion due to margin calls. However, to curb the situation, the London Metal Exchange stopped the trade for a couple of hours which brought the price back to $48,000 per tonne levels.10 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyAfter an assessment of the nickel industry and the biggest nickel mining companies, we chose the 10 biggest nickel mining companies.

Both contracts plummeted over 4% each on Tuesday.A sharp recovery in the dollar also weighed on crude prices, with the dollar index surging more than 1% on Tuesday as traders positioned for the minutes of the Fed’s December meeting, due to be released later on Wednesday.Focus will be on whether policymakers support a further slowing in interest rate hikes, following an increasing number of signs that U.S. inflation has likely peaked. But given that inflation is still trending well above the Fed’s target range, markets remained on edge.A slew of U.S. data this week is also expected to shed more light on the world’s largest oil consumer, starting with manufacturing activity data for December due later in the day. Nonfarm payrolls data for December, due on Friday, is also expected to provide more insight into the jobs market.Traders fear that a sustained rise in U.S. interest rates could weigh on economic activity and potentially trigger a recession in 2023- a scenario that is negative for crude demand. The prospect of a recession triggered wild swings in oil prices through 2022, and is expected to cause more volatility in the near-term.Concerns over a delayed economic recovery in China were also heightened after President Xi Jinping struck a more cautious tone than expected during his new year's address. The country is grappling with an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases after it relaxed several restrictions in December.Story continuesAnalysts warned that rising infections in the country are likely to delay an economic reopening, and could potentially damage the Chinese economy even further in the near-term.

However, no agreement was forthcoming, prompting the two sides to raise the stakes to protect their interests in the mine, known as Cobre Panama.The dispute, which began at the end of 2021, has become a litmus test of Panama's ability to remain attractive to business even as the government seeks to reduce inequality by reviewing longterm deals that many analysts regard as too generous to business.""Cobre Panama is the only metal mine operating in the country and many foreign companies started operations in Panama with its arrival. What happens will have a huge impact that seems to have not been properly weighed by both parties,"" said Zorel Morales, director of Panama's mining chamber.Failure to reach a deal could spook foreign investors at a time when Panama is looking to develop three other copper deposits that could bring in investments similar to Cobre Panama's, said Morales.Panama's demand that the company pay at least $375 million in annual tax has been at the center of the dispute, and during last week's talks First Quantum raised points it wanted included in its contract after a Dec. 14 deadline to reach agreement expired, according to a source linked to the government.Exclusive rights to explore other minerals, enlarge the area of its concession, a $1 billion tax credit for its investment and a demand that no laws enacted after the new contract affect its operations were among the issues raised, the source said.The company declined to comment on details of the negotiations. A spokesperson for the government did not reply to a request for comment.Story continuesPanamanian President Laurentino Cortizo said on Monday the government had presented a final contract offer to the company.On Tuesday, lawmakers voted to summon the country's commerce and industry minister and environment minister to answer questions on the company, covering operating permits, royalties, sanctions for environmental offences and the progress of negotiations on the new contract.The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.First Quantum paid $61 million in royalties to Panama's government in 2021, while the Cobre Panama mine posted sales revenues of $3.2 billion for the year, company data showed.Meanwhile, other businesses circle the mine, which started production in 2019. Government records show at least two requests are under review to explore gold and other metals near First Quantum's concession.Both parties have publicly said they want to strike a deal, but their failure to do so before the latest government deadline expired prompted Panama to order a halt to the mine's operations and the company to start arbitration proceedings.LUCRATIVE ASSETIn 2021, Cobre Panama represented more than half of First Quantum's earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). It also accounts for about 3.5% of Panama's gross domestic product.The firm has invested over $10 billion in the mine and paid only nominal dividends to shareholders during its initial years, according to company data.Cobre Panama represents about 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, interacts with some 1,800 suppliers and is the country's biggest private investment, according to business adviser Rene Quevedo, from consultancy GS&amp;S Consultores.Mining was the country's most dynamic sector during 2021, more than doubling in output. Fitch Ratings revised Panama's credit outlook to stable from negative in February, highlighting booming copper exports.The mining row could hamper government plans as Cortizo wants to pump some $190 million from the miner's annual payments into Panama's national pension scheme, which risks running out of funds in 2024, according to the International Labor Organization.""If there's no agreement, the damage would be serious,"" Quevedo said.The company has said the cost of halting operations remains ""uncertain"". Cortizo's government has not disclosed any assessment of how the dispute could affect Panama.Panama's government says it is prepared to face all legal scenarios to defend the national interest.""It's a Panama Canal type of negotiation,"" said Hernan Arboleda, director of public policies at the economy and finance ministry, pointing to the country's experience in negotiating with the United States to secure control of its famous waterway.""Panama can demonstrate to international authorities that this is not an equitable contract,"" he told Reuters.(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire; Additional reporting by Milagro Vallecillos; Editing by Dave Graham; Marguerita Choy and Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

Based on the last year's worth of payments, Verizon Communications has a trailing yield of 6.5% on the current stock price of $40.12. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Verizon Communications is paying out an acceptable 56% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Verizon Communications generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The company paid out 98% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.While Verizon Communications's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Verizon Communications to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Verizon Communications, with earnings per share up 7.4% on average over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Verizon Communications has lifted its dividend by approximately 2.7% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Verizon Communications? Earnings per share have grown somewhat, although Verizon Communications paid out over half its profits and the dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. It's not that we think Verizon Communications is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that being said, if you're still considering Verizon Communications as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Verizon Communications you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

255,ab8edfeb-cf2f-3bb3-b428-ee98f91168fe,TPR,2023-01-04,15 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-luxury-companies-world-143723421.html,1672756643,STORY,"['TPR', 'LULU', 'RL', 'LEVI', 'COLM', 'CPRI', 'GIL', 'VFC']","[In this article, we will discuss the 15 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World. You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Luxury Companies in the World.The luxury industry consists of manufacturers of personal luxury goods and companies that sell luxury experiences, such as those in the hospitality business. The demand in this sector is frequently correlated to income levels, especially in developed economies where the primary target market is located. However, in 2022, the global luxury market defied this logic, as it continued to grow under uncertain economic times, as per a report issued by Bain &amp; Company. The luxury sector experienced a sales boom in 2021 following COVID-19, and this trend persisted in 2022. According to Bain, the market for personal luxury products was expected to reach €353 billion by the end of 2022, a 22% YoY rise. Bain also forecasted the global luxury market to grow by 21% in 2022, closing the year at €1.4 trillion.An expanding customer base and the use of a multi-touchpoint ecosystem make the luxury market resilient against economic upheavals. Luxury companies are expanding this ecosystem to the virtual world, with several brands launching their metaverse strategies in 2022. LMVH, home to luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, launched its immersive virtual world at VivaTech, allowing customers to experience its innovations. L'Oréal has been dabbling in NFTs and is even considering adopting crypto as a payment method. Gucci also launched Gucci Town, a Roblox-based online marketplace for virtual clothing and games.Demand from Generation Z is the other main factor driving expansion. Millennials and Gen Z accounted for 72% of the global luxury market in 2022. Explaining the rise in demand from these younger customers, a Morgan Stanley report notes that a rising number of these younger customers have not yet moved out of their parents' houses. When young individuals free up their budget for daily essentials, they are left with more disposable income to spend on wants, which explains the rising demand for luxury items. The RealReal 2022 Luxury Resale Report also finds that, due to the development of a solid resale market, more customers, particularly Gen-Z, are viewing their luxury purchases as investments.Story continuesThe future of luxury corporations thus depends not only on macroeconomic conditions but also on how they can maintain their appeal to the socially and politically active Gen-Z and launch successful omnichannel marketing campaigns.littleny/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe focused more on the luxury clothing space for this article and picked the biggest luxury companies operating in the clothing, apparel, footwear and related industries.15.

Investments in product upgrades, though augur well for the industry’s long-term prospects, often weigh on margins and profitability in the near term. The recent slowdown in manufacturing activities, thanks to rising interest rates, implies that the industry is likely to experience lower demand in the near term.Amid the prevalent headwinds in the industry, Stanley Black &amp; Decker and Kennametal are likely to struggle in the near future.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry comprises companies that develop and distribute hand and mechanics tools, hydraulic tools, engineered fastening systems, and heavy-lifting technology solutions. Arc-welding products, robotic-welding packages, fume-extraction equipment, oxy-fuel cutting equipment, plasma cutters, healthcare solutions, electronic security solutions and other products are also produced by some tool-makers.The highly advanced tools are used in industrial, commercial, oil &amp; gas, mining, automotive and other industries. The providers of electronic security solutions cater to commercial, retailers, government, financial and healthcare markets. Talking about international operations, some industry players provide products and services to customers in North and South America, Japan, Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Tools IndustryWeakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Amid the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy tightening, the recent slowdown in manufacturing activities points to a lower output scenario for the industry participants at least in the near term. Per the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) latest report, the manufacturing index touched 49% in November 2022, contracting for the first time since May 2020.Story continuesA figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. With the reduction in new order rates, the index was 1.2 percentage points lower than that recorded in October. Industrial production declined 0.2% in November, with a 0.6% decrease in manufacturing output.Supply Chain &amp; Cost Woes: Despite the situation improving, supply chain constraints, mainly related to the availability of semiconductor chips, and cost inflation continue to be major headwinds for the industry at least in the first half of 2023. Raw material, freight and logistics cost inflation are hurting the margins and profitability of industry participants. A dearth of skilled workers in the United States has been a perennial problem for the industry participants.Hefty Investments in Product Development: The industry participants often make significant investments to upgrade products and services to stay competitive in the market. While these bode well for long-term prospects, frequent investments hurt the margins and profitability of these companies. Successive acquisitions to expand product portfolio, boost technological capabilities and extend geographical presence often leave these companies with a highly leveraged balance sheet.Zacks Industry Rank Suggests Bleak ProspectsThe Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry is a six-stock group within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #236, which places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from weak earnings prospects for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in the group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have been revised downward by 51.9% over the past year.Now, let’s take a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Underperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite index and the sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has declined approximately 45%, compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 index’s decrease of 13.9% and 21.2%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward P/E (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing tools and related product stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.58X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.68X. It is also below the sector’s P/E (F12M) ratio of 17.64X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.49X, as low as 10.87X and at the median of 15.62X.Should You Buy the Dips?Below we mention two stocks from the industry that are reeling under the effects of supply chain woes and high raw material costs. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell). So, it’s not wise to buy the dips in these stocks.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kennametal: Based in Latrobe, PA, Kennametal is a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of high-speed metal cutting tools, tooling systems and wear-resistant parts. Weakness in the transportation market due to supply-chain restrictions, mainly related to chip availability, is a major challenge for the company. Escalating raw material costs are denting KMT’s earnings, while foreign currency headwinds are hurting its top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kennametal’s fiscal 2023 earnings (ended Jun 30, 2023) has been revised southward by 13.3% in the past 60 days. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 company have declined 36.4% in the past year.Stanley Black: Headquartered in New Britain, CT, Stanley Black manufactures and provides tools and related accessories and engineered fastening systems. Weakness in the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment due to reduced retail and consumer demand, thanks to an increase in interest rates, is weighing on the company’s performance. Supply-chain restrictions, primarily semiconductor constraints, and logistics and input cost increases are likely to continue to hurt SWK’s operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stanley Black’s 2023 earnings has been revised downward by 18.6% in the past 60 days. Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 company have plunged 60.9% over the past year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

258,683fdb1e-a902-3c74-96b9-8fc0b272fec9,SWK,2023-01-04,Should You Buy the Dip in These 2 Manufacturing Tools Stocks Amid Industry Challenges?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-dip-2-manufacturing-tools-132901546.html,1672752541,STORY,"['KMT', '^GSPC', 'SWK']","[The Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry is plagued by persistent supply chain disruptions and raw material cost inflation. Investments in product upgrades, though augur well for the industry’s long-term prospects, often weigh on margins and profitability in the near term. The recent slowdown in manufacturing activities, thanks to rising interest rates, implies that the industry is likely to experience lower demand in the near term.Amid the prevalent headwinds in the industry, Stanley Black &amp; Decker SWK and Kennametal KMT are likely to struggle in the near future.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry comprises companies that develop and distribute hand and mechanics tools, hydraulic tools, engineered fastening systems, and heavy-lifting technology solutions. Arc-welding products, robotic-welding packages, fume-extraction equipment, oxy-fuel cutting equipment, plasma cutters, healthcare solutions, electronic security solutions and other products are also produced by some tool-makers. The highly advanced tools are used in industrial, commercial, oil &amp; gas, mining, automotive and other industries. The providers of electronic security solutions cater to commercial, retailers, government, financial and healthcare markets. Talking about international operations, some industry players provide products and services to customers in North and South America, Japan, Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Tools IndustryWeakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Amid the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy tightening, the recent slowdown in manufacturing activities points to a lower output scenario for the industry participants at least in the near term. Per the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) latest report, the manufacturing index touched 49% in November 2022, contracting for the first time since May 2020. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. With the reduction in new order rates, the index was 1.2 percentage points lower than that recorded in October. Industrial production declined 0.2% in November, with a 0.6% decrease in manufacturing output.Supply Chain &amp; Cost Woes: Despite the situation improving, supply chain constraints, mainly related to the availability of semiconductor chips, and cost inflation continue to be major headwinds for the industry at least in the first half of 2023. Raw material, freight and logistics cost inflation are hurting the margins and profitability of industry participants. A dearth of skilled workers in the United States has been a perennial problem for the industry participants.Hefty Investments in Product Development: The industry participants often make significant investments to upgrade products and services to stay competitive in the market. While these bode well for long-term prospects, frequent investments hurt the margins and profitability of these companies. Successive acquisitions to expand product portfolio, boost technological capabilities and extend geographical presence often leave these companies with a highly leveraged balance sheet.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Suggests Bleak ProspectsThe Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry is a six-stock group within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #236, which places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from weak earnings prospects for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in the group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have been revised downward by 51.9% over the past year.Now, let’s take a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Underperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite index and the sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has declined approximately 45%, compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 index’s decrease of 13.9% and 21.2%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward P/E (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing tools and related product stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.58X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.68X. It is also below the sector’s P/E (F12M) ratio of 17.64X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.49X, as low as 10.87X and at the median of 15.62X, as the chart below shows:Price-to-Earnings Ratio Price-to-Earnings Ratio Should You Buy the Dips?Below we mention two stocks from the industry that are reeling under the effects of supply chain woes and high raw material costs. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell). So, it’s not wise to buy the dips in these stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Kennametal: Based in Latrobe, PA, Kennametal is a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of high-speed metal cutting tools, tooling systems and wear-resistant parts. Weakness in the transportation market due to supply-chain restrictions, mainly related to chip availability, is a major challenge for the company. Escalating raw material costs are denting KMT’s earnings, while foreign currency headwinds are hurting its top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kennametal’s fiscal 2023 earnings (ended Jun 30, 2023) has been revised southward by 13.3% in the past 60 days. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 company have declined 36.4% in the past year.Price and Consensus: KMTStanley Black: Headquartered in New Britain, CT, Stanley Black manufactures and provides tools and related accessories and engineered fastening systems. Weakness in the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment due to reduced retail and consumer demand, thanks to an increase in interest rates, is weighing on the company’s performance. Supply-chain restrictions, primarily semiconductor constraints, and logistics and input cost increases are likely to continue to hurt SWK’s operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stanley Black’s 2023 earnings has been revised downward by 18.6% in the past 60 days.

259,07baab5f-779a-3f1d-a697-5abeb93da6b0,NVDA,2023-01-04,Some Investors May Be Worried About NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-nvidias-nasdaq-120056379.html,1672833656,STORY,['NVDA'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$7.3b ÷ (US$40b - US$6.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 22%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceIn the above chart we have measured NVIDIA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NVIDIA.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at NVIDIA, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 33% where it was five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's ROCEWhile returns have fallen for NVIDIA in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 159% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.Story continuesLike most companies, NVIDIA does come with some risks, and we've found 3 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Frequent rate hikes by the Fed act as another tailwind for insurers. However, continued catastrophic events and persistent inflationary headwinds might create roadblocks in the way of P&amp;C insurers.Premiums, being the most significant contributors to insurers’ top lines, remain well-poised for growth as an improved pricing environment encourages insurers to implement price hikes. With consistent rate increases, insurers can pursue uninterrupted claim payments, which is of dire need amid an active catastrophe season. According to the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate average annual premium growth of 2.1% in 2023 and 2024.Though an active catastrophe environment comes with its share of worries, they usually accelerate the policy renewal rate. P&amp;C insurers also remain equipped with reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development to counter catastrophe losses and shield their underwriting results.An improving interest rate scenario usually boosts the investment yields of insurers. Seven rate hikes were implemented by the Fed last year. Reports have surfaced hinting at rate increases in early 2023.A solid capital position motivates P&amp;C insurers to increasingly undertake mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). These growth initiatives aim to strengthen an insurer’s capability and bring about a diversified portfolio, which minimize concentration risks for insurers. However, the looming fear of recession and continued interest rate increases might slow down the pace of entering M&amp;A deals by industry players.The insurance industry pursues significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics for ramping up claim payments and bringing about automation in processes. These investments will save operational costs and boost the margins of insurers in the long-run.Story continuesThe prevailing scenario makes us optimistic regarding consistent growth in the industry, which should boost the prospects of companies with sound business fundamentals.The Zacks P&amp;C Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, has gained 10.4% in the past six months compared with the sector’s growth of 2.6%. The S&amp;P Index dipped 0.5% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Against this backdrop, let’s take a look at the two P&amp;C insurers, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV and The Allstate Corporation ALL, with market capitalizations of $43.9 billion and $36 billion, respectively. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's delve deeper into specific parameters to ascertain which company is better positioned at the moment.Price PerformanceThough shares of both companies have underperformed the industry’s rally of 10.4% in the past six months, Travelers has the edge over Allstate on this front. TRV and ALL gained 9.6% and 3.8%, respectively, in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Earnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise track helps investors get an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.Travelers’ bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 25.39%. Meanwhile, Allstate’s earnings surpassed the mark in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 8.29%. It is clear that TRV has a better reading than ALL here.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a profitability measure, which indicates how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders' funds.Travelers’ ROE of 14.3% compares favorably with Allstate’s ROE of 5.1% and remains higher than the industry’s average of 6.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ValuationPrice-to-book (P/B) value is the best multiple used for valuing insurers. Compared with Allstate’s trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 2.31, Travelers is cheaper, with a reading of 2.21. The P&amp;C insurance industry’s P/B ratio is 1.52. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Debt-to-Equity RatioThe lower the debt-to-equity ratio, the better it is for the company, as it implies a sound solvency level. Both stocks have a higher leverage ratio than the industry’s average of 25.8%. TRV’s leverage ratio of 36.6% betters ALL’s ratio of 45.4%. Therefore, Travelers holds an edge over Allstate on this front. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Dividend YieldBoth companies are regular dividend payers. Allstate’s dividend yield of 2.5% betters Travelers’ metric of 2% and remains higher than the industry’s average of 0.4%. ALL wins over TRV on this front.Growth ProjectionBoth stocks' expected long-term earnings growth rate is lower than the industry’s average of 9.7%. However, the metric for Travelers is pegged at 5.5%, better than Allstate’s figure of 5.1%.VGM ScoreVGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum. Both Travelers and Allstate have an impressive VGM Score of B, faring equally on this front.Insurance PremiumsOne of the major contributors to a P&amp;C insurer’s revenues is its premiums. Net written premiums of Travelers improved 11% year over year in the first nine months of 2022. Meanwhile, Allstate’s premiums rose 8.4% year over year in the same time frame. Thus. TRV is the winner in this context.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Travelers is better-poised than Allstate with respect to most metrics barring the ones on dividend yield and VGM Score. With the scale significantly toward TRV, the stock appears to be better positioned than ALL.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm putting a buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to 310 a share. Joining us now to discuss is the analyst behind that note. We want to bring in Ken Leon, CFRA's director of equity research. Ken, it's great to have you here. So let's talk about why you're more bullish on Netflix. Certainly, 2022 was a tough year for not only Netflix, but really the industry at large. Why do you see that tide turning this year?KEN LEON: Well, thanks for having me. And 2023 and '24 are going to be, I think, great years for Netflix after a challenging '22. We had a sell rating for most of '22. And mostly, we were too severe, I think, on our valuation where we feel it was-- or felt was no different than any of its peer group.But then we took another look at this company, and we looked at some of the new catalysts for 2023. And we say Netflix does deserve a premium. We're talking about a company where it has management in place for over 10 years. That's not true for Disney, Warner Brothers, or even Paramount. Secondly, the company's single focus on video streaming and the secular shift is from linear networks to video streaming.Additionally, they have really invested in both programming content and technology platform that they're getting-- they're reaping the benefits not only in the US and Europe, but also in markets like South Korea, Turkey, et cetera. So where that leads you is a premium valuation. So we raised our target up to 310. We still think this company has lots of opportunity with new revenue sources. Widely noted is advertisers and marketers for the first time will be using Netflix platform.Second would be the new ad pay plan at $6.99 per month, more likely to bring in demographics, more middle class, less affluent. And it won't cannibalize their current base, which goes as high as 19.99 per month for, really, a lot of features you can't get at the lower rate.Story continuesAnd lastly-- and this is kind of the unspoken truth-- is so many of us and friends and family share our account. And that's going to be, I'll say gracefully, pulled back or where you can be added for maybe $2 or $3 a month. So all that leakage is going to create revenue and cash flow for Netflix. So I like what I'm seeing. I also think, again, they continue to deliver great new episodes, great new features, and they're not spending billions of dollars on a market loss leader, which is sporting events, which has become so crazy to compete with to get any of those.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it's interesting to see them stay out. It does look like a good decision when you consider $75 billion a year for the NBA. But it's that ad tier that was supposed to be the game changer. And the initial rollout didn't sound so good. Only 9% of new signups chose that tier. And Netflix had to return money to advertisers. Why does that not factor in? And where do you see that improving?KEN LEON: We see it improving in the second half of this year into 2024. When you look at the 47 analysts who cover this stock, they do have growth in both revenue-- and this is part of it-- in '23, but then up in '24 and a significant increase in EBITDA, which is an important measure for valuation.So again, what we haven't seen yet is not only this lower rate ad pay plan, but which is, true, small out of the gate, but also the advertisers, both for spot and longer term contracts, which are going to get new business. And they're going to take that away from some of the broadcast networks in terms of advertising.SEANA SMITH: Ken, when it comes to live sports, a number of arrivals, Netflix's rivals, have turned to that in order to drive some of that subscription growth. You make the case that you don't think that's necessary. I guess, why not? Is it purely just based on the amount that some of these rivals are paying for those rights?KEN LEON: It really is. It just-- it's such a high hurdle that to really have that kind of investment, it's-- the returns are just very challenging. But if you're live sports and live news like Fox, and we have a buyer in FOXA, and they're staying out of streaming, they do that very well. Paramount is trying to do both. Disney with ESPN is trying to do sports and streaming.Disney's got a lot of challenges, but the stock has been so hit that we think Bob Iger is going to create some new catalysts to get the stock higher, which is why we have a buy in Disney. But again, for best in class, that premium to the peer group and a management that executes and trusts each other for over 10 years, I think we're going to see good things from Netflix in 2023.DAVE BRIGGS: Ken, Netflix spent 450 million to acquire the ""Glass Onion"" franchise, if you will, the ""Knives Out"" franchise. ""Glass Onion,"" terrific movie. What is stickier for streamers right now? Is it movies like that, or is it the shows that they have really found success with, more like ""Emily in Paris""? Is that worth the money?KEN LEON: They have both. So whereas if you go to Amazon Prime Video, a major competitor that spent billions just related to getting the ""Lord of the Rings"" or, in the case of HBO Max, with, of course, ""House of Dragons,"" which was great, but it was over in, what, 10 episodes? So, you know, Netflix is just prolific. They spend about $17 billion. It looks like the list-- you have to remember, again, this is an organically grown company that hasn't made acquisitions other than this one recently.And they've been able to generate an enormous library of their known franchises and episodes, as well as movies. So, more to come from Netflix, and they're actually more confident generally of their own creation versus spending over a billion and getting a flash. And then once it's over, you have higher churn.So, you know, a lot more to see here on these issues. But again, Netflix has confidence in how they do business. I don't believe Paramount, Warner Brothers, Discovery, or Disney have video streaming figured out yet. And then there's a host of other players here that are here either for one big spend, big event, whether it's Amazon or even perhaps YouTube getting Sunday NFL streaming. And they're all experimenting, but Netflix fully understands this business. That gives them an edge.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, CFRA director of equity research, Ken Leon, good to see you, sir. Thank you.]"

Streaming profitability.""Streaming losses [are] the absolute number one issue on hand,"" Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Yahoo Finance Live. ""We've seen the streaming business at Disney already lose about $8 billion. They're expected to lose another $3 billion in fiscal 2023, so obviously Bob Iger really has to go back and articulate a much better strategy.""In late November, Iger gave investors a taste of what seemed to be the first step of that strategy — firing Kareem Daniel and restructuring Disney's Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) division, one of former CEO Bob Chapek's first big swings.""As you know, this is a time of enormous change and challenges in our industry, and our work will also focus on creating a more efficient and cost-effective structure,"" Iger said at the time of the reorganization.Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the European premiere of ""The Lion King"" in London, Britain July 14, 2019. REUTERS/Henry NichollsIn its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year. High content costs were largely to blame as the company upped its content budget by $8 billion in 2022 to a whopping $33 billion.Story continuesManagement said it expects streaming losses to shrink by about $200 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 before reaching profitability in fiscal 2024.One way the company plans to stick to that timeline is through layoffs and hiring freezes first implemented by Chapek shortly before his ouster.Iger, while speaking at a town hall with employees, revealed there were no plans to reverse the hiring freeze as he continues to evaluate Disney's current cost structure — an evaluation investors will be hyper-focused on in 2023.Will Disney buy out Comcast's stake in Hulu? As Iger charts a path to streaming profitably, he will likely have to decide the fate of streaming giant Hulu.Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal controlling the rest. Under the terms of the 2019 agreement, which set Disney's guaranteed minimum equity value for Hulu at $27.5 billion, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake as early as January 2024.Which is what NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said he expects will happen.""We have a put, they have a call,"" Shell said at an investor conference last month. ""We think [Hulu] is worth a lot of money because it's sold on a full control basis as if you were auctioning it off. And I think [there are] no indications that anything else is going to happen [other] than Disney writing us a big check for the asset in 2024.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Some analysts, however, have suggested Disney could sell its majority stake to help offset accelerating streaming losses amid an ultra-competitive landscape.""Personally, I think selling Hulu would be a good idea,"" Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.The analyst, who said Hulu is ""not a Disney-branded product,"" explained the media giant ""would be better off really focusing on the strengths of the company — that branded, high-quality, family content, rather than trying to be everything to everybody.""Lightshed Partners’ Richard Greenfield agreed, writing in a November blog post: ""Hulu’s actual worth is unclear if Disney wants to keep the Hulu original programming created by Disney for Disney+.""""Essentially, Iger has to decide on a streaming strategy,"" Greenfield said. ""Does Disney want to run multiple streaming services as they do now, focus all their energy on a vertically-integrated and more narrow Disney+ strategy or do they envision a world with just one 'everything' Disney service (combining Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+)?""ESPN: Keep or spin off?In addition to Hulu, media analysts have long questioned the murky future of ESPN and whether or not Disney should consider spinning off the popular sports network — a suggestion previously made by Third Point's Dan Loeb.Loeb argued ESPN would have greater flexibility to pursue business initiatives, such as sports betting, if it were not part of Disney.""DIS will begin the spin-off process for ESPN &amp; ABC including launching ESPN in streaming a la carte,"" Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall wrote in a note published late last month. ""Cost rationalization and balance sheet options are critical to reaching this outcome. The result is a better-off remaining DIS.""But not everyone agrees.""We're very much against spinning off ESPN... that's the dumbest thing ever,"" Jason Bazinet, managing director at Citi, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.Bazinet went on to explain ESPN has the potential to be a much bigger global business, especially if Disney chooses to leverage the internet for distribution. He also said the network generates the bulk of Disney's cash flow, which will ultimately fund its pivot to direct-to-consumer and help offset accelerating streaming losses.""What Disney is embarking upon with a direct-to-consumer business is very much like a cable company or a telecom company,"" Bazinet said, stressing how DTC bridges the gap between the consumer and sports rights. ""They should not spin it off.""In its most recent fiscal year, Disney's operating income for its Linear Networks segment — which includes ESPN — totaled $8.52 billion.Parks: Will Iger do away with Chapek-era price hikes? Following earlier price hikes in February 2022, Disney again raised prices for most of its Florida theme parks on December 8, upping the costs of single-day and multi-day tickets, in addition to the renewals for its annual pass program, the Genie+ app, merchandise, food, and other in-park purchases.The price hikes, which were already in effect at Disneyland Anaheim, were a cause of widespread backlash during former CEO Bob Chapek's tenure.Disney fans angered by recent price hikes at its theme parksEven Iger was reportedly taken aback by the sharp increases.According to The Wall Street Journal, the executive was ""alarmed by increases in prices at Disney theme parks that Mr. Chapek argued would boost revenue and limit overcrowding.""Disney's theme parks missed expectations in its latest quarter as recession fears pressured consumer demand. Revenue from the company's parks, experiences, and consumer products division came in at $7.43 billion (vs. estimates of $7.59 billion), with operating income hitting $1.51 billion (vs. estimates of $1.9 billion.)Although it is unlikely that Iger will reverse the price hikes, could Disney fans see a reduction in the number of increases in 2023?Who will be the next Disney CEO?Even though Iger just regained his CEO position, investors are already thinking about his replacement.Rumors have swirled that internal candidates like Dana Walden, Disney General Entertainment Content Chairman, Alan Bergman, Walt Disney Studios Chairman, or Josh D'Amaro, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Chairman, could be next in line.Other possibilities include former employees Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, who left the company in 2020 after being passed over by Iger for the CEO role that ultimately went to Chapek.Mayer and Staggs currently run Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, which recently acquired Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine production company in a deal worth $900 million. Could Iger possibly purchase Candle Media to lure back Mayer and Staggs?Whatever occurs, analysts have said Iger's surprise return will likely complicate the journey in finding a long-term CEO.""For Iger to come back after just a few years and retake control, whoever is the next CEO of Disney, they're going to be looking over their shoulder from day one wondering if they're really the CEO of the company or if they're going to get pushed out like Chapek did,"" Doug Cruetz, media analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.""That's not a great position for Disney to be in if they're trying to find a person who can lead the company successfully, starting in 2024 and forward,"" he cautioned.Disney's top contenders to succeed CEO Bob IgerAlexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Zillow Group constantly adds new features to bolster experience for property managers and consumers.

288,6312de13-6674-353d-b443-6b4a031662fd,AKAM,2023-01-04,The 7 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy for the Coming Boom,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-edge-computing-stocks-201035822.html,1672517435,STORY,"['MSFT', 'NVDA', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'ANET', 'FSLY', 'AKAM']","[Although the broader technology space suffered a massive beatdown, investors still ought to consider the narrative undergirding the best edge computing stocks to buy. In simple terms, edge computing refers to a range of networks and devices positioned close to the end user. As you might suspect, the goal here is to bring processing “meat” closer to the source of demand, enabling greater efficiencies.Ultimately, the main objective of most businesses associated with edge computing stocks centers on productivity enhancements. In other words, it’s not about reinventing the computer but making it better. Sure enough, the segment already captures extraordinary relevance, reaching a valuation of $44.7 billion in 2022. Experts project that this space will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 17.8% to hit $101.3 billion by 2027.While certain subsegments present a higher-risk profile, the industry covers a wide spectrum, from public cloud providers to hardware manufacturers to content delivery networks. Below is a diverse list of edge computing stocks to buy for the coming boom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAMZNAmazon$84.00MSFTMicrosoft$239.82GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$88.73NVDANvidia$146.14ANETArista Networks$121.35AKAMAkamai$84.30FSLYFastly$8.19Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAn obvious choice among the biggest edge computing stocks to buy, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has long graduated from just being an e-commerce specialist. Among its many compelling business units stands Amazon Web Services, its public cloud computing network. Despite its exceptional relevance, AMZN presently occupies foreign territory: on a year-to-date basis, shares hemorrhaged 52% of equity value.I’m not going to hold back any punches. Such a magnitude of volatility imposes grave concerns about its viability. Nevertheless, it’s also fair to point out that the tech sector overall suffered disproportionately in 2022. From global supply chain woes to geopolitical flashpoints to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy to control inflation, growth-oriented AMZN absorbed some body blows.Story continuesHowever, daring contrarians of edge computing stocks may want to target Amazon. For one thing, its relevant business units (such as its cloud network) should become more prominent. As well, Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for a fair market value imply that AMZN is significantly undervalued.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comBoth a software and hardware giant, from a broader tech perspective, you arguably can’t go wrong with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). One of my many arguments favoring MSFT focuses on the underlying business ecosystem. Essentially, the company’s Windows operating system (OS) dominates the global desktop OS market. Therefore, if you want to succeed in business, you must be fluent in Microsoft.As both enterprises and individual professionals gravitate toward cloud computing, MSFT will subsequently garner more demand. Regarding the topic of best edge computing stocks to buy, Microsoft Azure has quickly risen up the ranks, supporting edge initiatives in both hardware and software.To be fair, MSFT – like Amazon above – does not represent pure-play edge computing stocks. This diverse profile widens vulnerabilities, thus forcing MSFT to slip 30% YTD. However, as society normalizes, previously underappreciated business units may rise to the forefront, lifting shares.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the top names in big tech, no discussion about edge computing stocks to buy would be complete without mentioning Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Through its Google Cloud network, enterprises and individual worker bees can connect and collaborate, fostering (arguably) superior productivity. As well, the sheer dominance and intuitiveness of the wider Google ecosystem bring much intrigue to the table.Because seemingly everybody uses Google – whether through its internet search engine or Gmail service – the ecosystem represents an organic transition. That’s going to be especially important with the burgeoning gig economy. With more people sick of the corporate nine-to-five branch out on their own, they will need mechanisms for client communications. Google is friendly, Google is familiar.To be sure, what’s not so friendly is Alphabet’s market performance. For instance, the Class C GOOG dropped over 40% in equity value since the start of the year. Still, as workplace norms change, Google’s cloud network offers a compelling narrative. Thus, it’s one of the best edge computing stocks to buy.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPerhaps when most folks hear the name Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), their minds immediately recall graphics processing units for video-gaming applications. While that’s one of the bread-and-butter business units for the company, Nvidia also ranks among the best edge computing stocks to buy, specifically in the hardware department.Basically, Nvidia’s GPUs – which serve to accelerate computing processes – have also been integrated into cloud-based data centers. In addition, Nvidia also leverages its acumen toward innovations that may benefit from edge-computing infrastructures, such as self-driving cars. Obviously, with automated transportation, you want data to be as close to the source of demand as possible. Unsurprisingly, Nvidia represents one of the leaders in this exciting arena.To be fair, what’s not so exciting is NVDA’s market performance. Since the beginning of the year, it’s lost over 53% of its equity value. As well, shares suffered a beatdown based on ongoing semiconductor industry weakness. Still, as I mentioned recently, the silver lining centers on analyst ratings. Wall Street experts still rank NVDA as a consensus strong buy.Arista Networks (ANET)Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the pioneers in software-driven cloud computing equipment, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) offers an intriguing case for edge computing stocks to buy. That’s because Arista has recently focused on what it terms “campus cloud,” essentially building smaller data centers for enterprises’ private use. In other words, the company extended the edge to a very localized level, potentially imparting myriad efficiencies.Another factor that should bolster the case for ANET as a candidate for edge computing stocks to buy is cybersecurity. Per the underlying company’s website, “Arista is the only modern AI-driven security platform that offers key building blocks for a zero-trust strategy, automated and advanced, threat hunting as well as network forensics.”As with other edge computing stocks, 2022 has not been kind to ANET, with shares dropping 16% YTD. However, the back half of the year presented an auspicious narrative heading into 2023. In the trailing six months, ANET gained almost 26% of its market value. It’s one to keep on the radar as the new year approaches.Akamai (AKAM)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA heavyweight in content delivery networks – which focus on moving and securing data between entities – Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) easily ranks among the best edge computing stocks to buy. Per its website, “Akamai has deployed the most pervasive, highly distributed content delivery network (CDN) with approximately 345,000 servers in more than 135 countries and over 1,300 networks around the world.”Unfortunately, for the moment, Wall Street doesn’t quite see the potential for AKAM yet. Since the start of the year, shares fell 28%. Nevertheless, as cloud-computing demand increases, the need for CDN service providers should likewise rise. Enticingly, the market prices AKAM at 14.4 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 23.3 times.This might be a deal too good to pass up. At the least, it should warrant further investigation.Also, AKAM features a consensus moderate buy rating among covering analysts. Perhaps most convincing of all, hedge funds have started bidding up AKAM, especially compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Fastly (FSLY)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksSometimes, you need to take some risks in life to move ahead. But does this sentiment apply to edge computing stocks? The leadership team at Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) would probably like you to think so. A CDN specialist, Fastly utterly dominated during the middle phase of the post-pandemic new normal. For instance, between late 2020 to early 2021, FSLY occasionally reached an average three-digit price tag.Unfortunately, circumstances changed for the worst in recent months. Presently, shares trade hand for a little over eight bucks a pop. In terms of performance, this framework translates to an almost 78% YTD loss. Not surprisingly, investment resource Gurufocus.com labels Fastly as a possible value trap. So, why would anyone consider FSLY as one of the edge computing stocks to buy?Fundamentally, the underlying CDN market may expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23% from 2022 to hit sector revenue of $95.37 billion by 2030. When assessing the smart money, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment for FSLY is “very positive.”It’s risky as an F-bomb, let me be 1,000% clear. But if you want to roll the dice, Fastly is available.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Higher premiums, policy charges and fee income attributable to the growth of business drive growth in Life Planner operations.U.S. businesses should continue to gain from a higher net investment spread, which includes benefits from variable investment income and rising interest rates. Favorable underwriting owing to declining COVID-related mortality experience and lower expenses on the back of cost savings initiatives should also add to the upside.PRU continues to invest in acquisitions and partnerships that enable it to grow in emerging markets.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -7.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 7.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share, indicating a change of +43.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +145.3%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.83 indicates a change of +2% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13%. The $19.91 billion and $19.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +67.1% and -2.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering United Rentals (URI), which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry.This equipment rental company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.32%.For the most recent quarter, United Rentals was expected to post earnings of $9 per share, but it reported $9.27 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.57 per share, while it actually produced $7.86 per share, a surprise of 19.63%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor United Rentals, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.United Rentals currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.35%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Oracle's shares before the 9th of January in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 24th of January.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.32 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.28 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Oracle has a trailing yield of approximately 1.5% on its current stock price of $83.72. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Oracle's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Oracle Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Oracle paying out a modest 39% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 41% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Oracle, with earnings per share up 7.3% on average over the last five years. Management have been reinvested more than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company has been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Oracle has delivered an average of 18% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Oracle for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Oracle is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Oracle is halfway there. There's a lot to like about Oracle, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Oracle you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

At the same time, customers stay cautious about replenishment given the excess industry supply and low pricing environment, impacted by continued macro headwinds.With on-hand inventories at end customers across PC, servers, and smartphones to a lesser extent, still above normal levels, Vinh expects the inventory correction to continue to pressure pricing in 1H23.Vinh notes that NAND pricing declines worsened further across all timeframes, reflecting tougher supply-demand dynamics vs. DRAM.Demand for mobile and PCs remains sluggish, most notably in China and Europe, as impacts from the prolonged COVID disruptions, Russia/Ukraine war, and inflationary pressure continue to impact consumer spending and the domestic economic outlook. At the same time, the holiday sell-through in the U.S. also sees signs of softness.For servers, U.S. CSPs procurement remains cautious given the pricing downturn and sufficient levels of memory inventory on hand, despite secular demand trends remaining largely intact.On the other hand, macro uncertainties continue to impact the demand from enterprise customers due to tightening budgets.Despite the majority of memory producers having chosen to moderate supply bit-growth, Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd's (OTC: SSNLF) decision to increase production will likely continue to pressure pricing as oversupply conditions persist through 2023, pressuring NAND margins more than DRAM.Story continuesTherefore, Vinh expects 1Q NAND pricing to decline low-teens% Q/Q, as demand trends remain challenging and broad-based inventory adjustments continue and will likely persist into 1H23.Vinh views the December pricing results as broadly consistent with Micron Technology, Inc's (NASDAQ: MU) earnings and negative for DRAM and NAND.Vinh maintained a positive long-term view that secular trends in 5G, data centers, and edge/endpoint devices will drive memory demand.Vinh views the DRAM market as healthier and more profitable than NAND over the long term, given industry consolidation, with three significant producers remaining (MU, Samsung, and SK Hynix), long-term solid demand drivers, disciplined capacity expansion, and extended equipment lead times.Price Action: MU shares traded higher by 0.83% at $50.40 on the last check Tuesday.Latest Ratings for MUDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022WedbushUpgradesNeutralOutperformJan 2022Goldman SachsMaintainsBuyJan 2022New Street ResearchInitiates Coverage OnBuyView More Analyst Ratings for MUView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaHuawei's Business Comes Out Of The Woods, Chair Eric Xu SaysIndia's 5G Smartphone Shipments Likely To Beat 4G: CounterpointIf You Invested $1,000 In Dogecoin On Jan. 1, 2021, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Dogecoin (DOGE/USD)Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

These companies are gaining from growing testing needs of newer biological drugs, ever-increasing complexity in molecular structure and rising instrument orders across the globe. Increasing healthcare spending is a key catalyst, driven by aging demography, and continued innovation in the pharma and life sciences end-markets.Higher demand for generic drugs and biosimilars drives growth for scientific tool and apparatus providers. However, the industry is suffering from the lingering effects of COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown in China.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry comprises companies offering scientific instruments, analytical tools, diagnostic solutions, precision instruments &amp; services, and test &amp; sensor solutions. The primary end markets served by the industry participants are life science research in academia, medical schools and government, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, microbiology and diagnostics, nanotechnology, and materials science research.A few companies also serve the food and nutritional safety, biochemical and industrial spaces. Most industry participants are under stringent regulatory scrutiny worldwide. They have to adhere to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) norms, as well as rules set by other global regulatory bodies, for serving highly regulated end-markets like life sciences and pharma.3 Trends Shaping the Instruments-Scientific Industry's FutureEnd-Market Demand Strong: The industry is benefiting from strong end-market demand, particularly from the life science, pharmaceutical and academic markets. Increasing demand for generic drugs and biosimilars is driving growth for scientific tool and apparatus providers. Pharma companies are focused on rapidly growing areas like proteomics and phenomics, biopharma and applied, microbiology and diagnostics, and neuroscience and cell microscopy. This creates significant demand for the instruments provided by the industry participants.Story continuesAging Demography Driving Spending: Socioeconomic factors like aging demography and increasing environmental regulations are fueling the demand for scientific measurement solutions. Robust worldwide healthcare spending is another major growth driver.Emerging Market Prospects Solid: The industry is gaining from increasing exposure to developing economies like China and India. Prospects in China are huge as regulators attempt to raise the country’s biopharma industry to global standards. Efforts to improve the country’s drug development process and production quality are noteworthy. These factors result in strong demand for instruments.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it at the bottom 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Oct 30, 2021, the industry’s 2022 earnings estimates have moved up 8.2%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Instruments – Scientific industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector but has lagged the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 13.9% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 21.2% and the broader sector’s slip of 35.5%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing scientific instrument stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 27.44X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.69X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 21.29X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 36.31X, as low as 21.24X and at the median of 25.46X.3 Scientific Instruments Providers to WatchMettler-Toledo: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from the solid momentum across its laboratory and industrial segments.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mettler-Toledo’s strengthening presence in the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World is a positive. Portfolio strength, cost-cutting efforts, robust sales and marketing strategies, benefits from investments in Spinnaker sales, and field resources are contributing well. A strong core industrial business is encouraging. Solid demand across pharmaceutical and life science markets is another tailwind.Shares of this Polaris Parkway, Columbus, OH-based company have lost 13.7% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mettler-Toledo’s current-year earnings has declined by a penny to $39.02 per share in the past 30 days.PerkinElmer: The Waltham, MA-based company is benefiting from the rising use of AI in healthcare.

These companies are gaining from growing testing needs of newer biological drugs, ever-increasing complexity in molecular structure and rising instrument orders across the globe. Increasing healthcare spending is a key catalyst, driven by aging demography, and continued innovation in the pharma and life sciences end-markets. Higher demand for generic drugs and biosimilars drives growth for scientific tool and apparatus providers. However, the industry is suffering from the lingering effects of COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown in China.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry comprises companies offering scientific instruments, analytical tools, diagnostic solutions, precision instruments &amp; services, and test &amp; sensor solutions. The primary end markets served by the industry participants are life science research in academia, medical schools and government, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, microbiology and diagnostics, nanotechnology, and materials science research. A few companies also serve the food and nutritional safety, biochemical, and industrial spaces. Most industry participants are under stringent regulatory scrutiny worldwide. They have to adhere to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) norms, as well as rules set by other global regulatory bodies, for serving highly regulated end-markets like life sciences and pharma.3 Trends Shaping the Instruments-Scientific Industry's FutureEnd-Market Demand Strong: The industry is benefiting from strong end-market demand, particularly from the life science, pharmaceutical and academic markets. Increasing demand for generic drugs and biosimilars is driving growth for scientific tool and apparatus providers. Pharma companies are focused on rapidly growing areas like proteomics and phenomics, biopharma and applied, microbiology and diagnostics, and neuroscience and cell microscopy. This creates significant demand for the instruments provided by the industry participants.Aging Demography Driving Spending: Socioeconomic factors like aging demography and increasing environmental regulations are fueling the demand for scientific measurement solutions. Robust worldwide healthcare spending is another major growth driver.Emerging Market Prospects Solid: The industry is gaining from increasing exposure to developing economies like China and India. Prospects in China are huge as regulators attempt to raise the country’s biopharma industry to global standards. Efforts to improve the country’s drug development process and production quality are noteworthy. These factors result in strong demand for instruments.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it at the bottom 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Oct 30, 2021, the industry’s 2022 earnings estimates have moved up 8.2%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Instruments – Scientific industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector but has lagged the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 13.9% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 21.2% and the broader sector’s slip of 35.5%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing scientific instrument stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 27.44X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.69X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 21.29X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 36.31X, as low as 21.24X and at the median of 25.46X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio       3 Scientific Instruments Providers to WatchMettler-Toledo: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from the solid momentum across its laboratory and industrial segments.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Mettler-Toledo’s strengthening presence in the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World is a positive.

It signed contracts with several gamemakers and built at least six of its own game studios in cities including Austin, Texas, and Montreal. So far, the results have been mixed. A 2021 game called Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance was received poorly, but one of this year’s most anticipated video game titles is the Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed Baldur’s Gate 3, made by the Belgian developer Larian Studios. Early versions have been received well by players.The growth at Wizards of the Coast has come alongside financial difficulties at Hasbro, whose shares fell 40% last year as higher prices led to lower toy sales.Story continuesThe company also cancelled an internal project code-named Jabberwocky and two other external games that were early in development.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe World’s Love Affair With Japanese Cars Is SouringSilicon Valley Can’t Quit Its Pizza Robot ObsessionIt Takes 6,000 Gallons of Water to Cool the World’s Fastest SupercomputerThe Secret to Ron DeSantis’s Success?

316,2685b473-edf6-39ac-abf7-07f39dbc301c,FIS,2023-01-04,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.'s (NYSE:FIS) Dismal Stock Performance Reflects Weak Fundamentals",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fidelity-national-information-services-inc-133410967.html,1672752850,STORY,['FIS'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Fidelity National Information Services' (NYSE:FIS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 15% over the past three months. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Fidelity National Information Services'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fidelity National Information Services is:2.1% = US$946m ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.02.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Fidelity National Information Services' Earnings Growth And 2.1% ROEAs you can see, Fidelity National Information Services' ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 15%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. For this reason, Fidelity National Information Services' five year net income decline of 23% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Fidelity National Information Services' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 15% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is FIS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Fidelity National Information Services Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Fidelity National Information Services' high three-year median payout ratio of 209% suggests that the company is depleting its resources to keep up its dividend payments, and this shows in its shrinking earnings. Its usually very hard to sustain dividend payments that are higher than reported profits.Moreover, Fidelity National Information Services has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 33% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Fidelity National Information Services' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 9.5%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Fidelity National Information Services. Particularly, its ROE is a huge disappointment, not to mention its lack of proper reinvestment into the business. As a result its earnings growth has also been quite disappointing. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

(NYSE:YUM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-yum-120022892.html,1672833622,STORY,['YUM'],"[Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Yum! Brands’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands What's The Opportunity In Yum! Brands?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 27.85x is currently well-above the industry average of 17.17x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Yum! Brands’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Yum! Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 29% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Yum! Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? YUM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe YUM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on YUM for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for YUM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Yum! Brands as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. For example, we've found that Yum! Brands has 3 warning signs (2 are significant!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.If you are no longer interested in Yum!

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Throughout the pandemic, Starbucks bulked up in China. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Seattle-based giant now has 6,021 locations, compared to 4,706 in the fourth quarter of 2020.This expansion plan extends back to 2017, when Starbucks bought into roughly 50% of its licensed stores in mainland China.Because of this rapid expansion, Starbucks' operating earnings were impacted more than other food service chains, such as McDonald's (MCD) and Yum! Brands (YUM), Senatore explained in her note. However, Starbucks' operating earnings should reach 60% to 70% of its pre-pandemic levels this year, she said.Interim CEO Howard Schultz, meanwhile, has said he is committed to “playing the long game” in China, according to the analyst call following fourth-quarter results. He said Starbucks plans to reach 9,000 stores in China by 2025.“We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category but likely the number-one Western consumer brand in the country,"" he said.Senatore said Starbucks “will have no problem reaching its long-term targets.""Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Mobile orders are a key to Starbucks growth in China.In the fourth quarter of 2022, active Starbucks Rewards members grew 29% from Q4 to over 17 million members, just below historical levels which Schultz noted was “coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China.”As shown in the graph above, Senatore explained how COVID-19 lockdowns impacted Starbucks business in China.""The peak in the second quarter FY21, March, was as people felt more confident in going out and they were allowed to leave their homes. You see the increase of the people who have used the app in the last 90 days, but over the same period of time you're seeing an increase in mobile orders as a share of total,"" she said.She added that mobile orders typically result in a ""larger transaction.""The dips in mobile orders occurred when people ""weren’t leaving their homes"" (during COVID lockdowns). Mobile orders drove 44% of total orders in Q4 and delivery represented 24%.And as more Chinese consumers adopt the morning coffee routine, Starbucks can be seen as an ""accessible luxury"" in China.""Similar to ... the U.S., Starbucks is seen as an accessible luxury for the average consumer at a more premium price compared to that of the others listed [in the report: Costa Coffee, Tim Hortons and McCafe].""Bank of America is one of 14 Starbucks Buys on Wall Street. There are 20 Holds and 1 Sell. In the first day of trading in the new year, shares of Starbucks are up a little more than 1 percent.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It was at 98.7 percent at the end of Q3.The Aon Pension Risk Tracker calculates the aggregate funded position on an accounting basis for companies in the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index with defined benefit (DB) plans.

Versions of the pension tracker are also available for the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S. and for other indices in the UK.Key findings for the year ending Dec. 31, 2022 include:Pension assets lost 15.6 percent over the year 2022.The long-term Government of Canada bond yield increased 160 basis points (bps) relative to the last year-end rate, and credit spreads widened by 45 bps. This combination resulted in an increase in the interest rates used to value pension liabilities from 2.77 percent to 4.82 percent. Given that most plans in Canada are still exposed to interest rate risk, the decrease in pension liability caused by increasing interest rates offset the negative effect of asset returns on the funded status of the plans.""Asset performance was poor in 2022. The poor asset performance was offset by a substantial increase in interest rates and therefore a decrease in liabilities,"" said Nathan LaPierre, partner, Wealth Solutions, Aon.

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Throughout the pandemic, Starbucks bulked up in China. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Seattle-based giant now has 6,021 locations, compared to 4,706 in the fourth quarter of 2020.This expansion plan extends back to 2017, when Starbucks bought into roughly 50% of its licensed stores in mainland China.Because of this rapid expansion, Starbucks' operating earnings were impacted more than other food service chains, such as McDonald's (MCD) and Yum! Brands (YUM), Senatore explained in her note. However, Starbucks' operating earnings should reach 60% to 70% of its pre-pandemic levels this year, she said.Interim CEO Howard Schultz, meanwhile, has said he is committed to “playing the long game” in China, according to the analyst call following fourth-quarter results. He said Starbucks plans to reach 9,000 stores in China by 2025.“We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category but likely the number-one Western consumer brand in the country,"" he said.Senatore said Starbucks “will have no problem reaching its long-term targets.""Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Mobile orders are a key to Starbucks growth in China.In the fourth quarter of 2022, active Starbucks Rewards members grew 29% from Q4 to over 17 million members, just below historical levels which Schultz noted was “coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China.”As shown in the graph above, Senatore explained how COVID-19 lockdowns impacted Starbucks business in China.""The peak in the second quarter FY21, March, was as people felt more confident in going out and they were allowed to leave their homes. You see the increase of the people who have used the app in the last 90 days, but over the same period of time you're seeing an increase in mobile orders as a share of total,"" she said.She added that mobile orders typically result in a ""larger transaction.""The dips in mobile orders occurred when people ""weren’t leaving their homes"" (during COVID lockdowns). Mobile orders drove 44% of total orders in Q4 and delivery represented 24%.And as more Chinese consumers adopt the morning coffee routine, Starbucks can be seen as an ""accessible luxury"" in China.""Similar to ... the U.S., Starbucks is seen as an accessible luxury for the average consumer at a more premium price compared to that of the others listed [in the report: Costa Coffee, Tim Hortons and McCafe].""Bank of America is one of 14 Starbucks Buys on Wall Street.

United Parcel Service (UPS), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this package delivery service has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.03%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, UPS was expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share, but it reported $2.99 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.28%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.14 per share, while it actually produced $3.29 per share, a surprise of 4.78%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for UPS. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UPS currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.50%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 31, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Performed in 2022Among the major stock exchanges in the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fared the best in 2022, declining just 8.8%. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.The Dow Jones, the 30-stock blue-chip index, had rallied almost 19% in 2021. But higher interest rates (the central banks across the globe tightened the monetary policy), 40-year-high inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty (heightened risk of a recession in the near term) roiled the markets in 2022, with the index slipping into the bear market in September-end. Further, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country, adding fuel to the fire.The outperformance of the Dow Jones index was driven by its exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors performed well last year, with energy being the best performing on the higher oil price. Additionally, industrials gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector received a boost from rising interest rates. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Visa and American Express – that are part of the index.In 2022, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP lost 15.3%, 10.2%, 4.1% and 9.7%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in these quality franchises.Story continuesPerformance in 2022While the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term remain a big headwind. Until now, cooling consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report and strong manufacturing activity suggest that a large part of the economy is holding up well. But higher rates have made borrowing expensive, pushing up the cost of buying a new car or house, increasing the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightening the risk of a recession.Hence, investors are cautious about entering the stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The bank has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of its competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions too.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. It has made substantial progress on this front, having already added more than 230 new branches and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past month.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In August 2022, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company acquired robo-advisor NextCapital. In April 2022, Goldman closed the acquisition of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., while in March, the company closed the buyout of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, the company acquired Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Such inorganic growth efforts will diversify the fee-revenue base and offer top-line stability.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first nine months of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 10.89, which is lower than the industry average of 14.50. Also, its P/B ratio of 1.07 is below the industry average of 1.56.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past seven days for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top-line growth in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #3 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that AXP is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company has formed strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It has also announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

This company, which is in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This credit card issuer and global payments company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.25%.For the most recent quarter, American Express was expected to post earnings of $2.42 per share, but it reported $2.47 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.07%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.37 per share, while it actually produced $2.57 per share, a surprise of 8.44%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for American Express. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.American Express currently has an Earnings ESP of +13.38%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

334,ee498571-90c9-3993-8965-38830253d5c2,AXP,2023-01-04,Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Performed in 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-4-dow-finance-stocks-131101921.html,1672751461,STORY,"['GS', 'AXP', 'V', 'JPM', '^DJI', 'COMP', '^GSPC', 'GSBD']","[Among the major stock exchanges in the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fared the best in 2022, declining just 8.8%. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.The Dow Jones, the 30-stock blue-chip index, had rallied almost 19% in 2021. But higher interest rates (the central banks across the globe tightened the monetary policy), 40-year-high inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty (heightened risk of a recession in the near term) roiled the markets in 2022, with the index slipping into the bear market in September-end. Further, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country, adding fuel to the fire.The outperformance of the Dow Jones index was driven by its exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors performed well last year, with energy being the best performing on the higher oil price. Additionally, industrials gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector received a boost from rising interest rates. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP – that are part of the index.In 2022, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP lost 15.3%, 10.2%, 4.1% and 9.7%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in these quality franchises. Performance in 2022Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term remain a big headwind. Until now, cooling consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report and strong manufacturing activity suggest that a large part of the economy is holding up well. But higher rates have made borrowing expensive, pushing up the cost of buying a new car or house, increasing the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightening the risk of a recession.Hence, investors are cautious about entering the stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The bank has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of its competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions too.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. It has made substantial progress on this front, having already added more than 230 new branches and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past month.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In August 2022, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company acquired robo-advisor NextCapital. In April 2022, Goldman closed the acquisition of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., while in March, the company closed the buyout of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, the company acquired Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Such inorganic growth efforts will diversify the fee-revenue base and offer top-line stability.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first nine months of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 10.89, which is lower than the industry average of 14.50. Also, its P/B ratio of 1.07 is below the industry average of 1.56.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has been revised upward.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past seven days for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top-line growth in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #3 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that AXP is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company has formed strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It has also announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ZBH is gaining from an ongoing business recovery from the COVID-led pandemic impact. The company has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. However, consistent pricing pressure and rising costs do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 21.6% compared with a 9.1% rise in the industry and a 4.4% rise in the S&amp;P 500.The renowned musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $26.76 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 7.7% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13.1%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayBusiness Recovery Continues: Despite the near-term pressure, Zimmer Biomet is putting efforts into business recovery in 2022. In the third quarter, U.S. sales rose 3.2% on the back of strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in Zimmer Biomet’s Knee and Hip businesses. EMEA performed better than expected, driven by procedure recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets.Focus on Emerging Markets to Drive Growth: Over the recent past, Zimmer Biomet has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. The company's strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. While the integration of Biomet is over, the combined company has started to get benefitted from a strong presence in emerging markets with an extended portfolio that includes upper and lower joints. According to the combined company, this will help develop the extremities and trauma business going forward. Zimmer Biomet expects to establish critical mass in spine and dental that will position the company to compete effectively and gain share in these significant markets.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesDental and Spine Spin-Off to Bode Well: Zimmer Biomet recently completed its planned spin-off procedure of the dental &amp; spine arm. According to Zimmer Biomet management, this planned spin-off of its Spine and Dental business is part of the company’s third phase of ongoing transformation, which includes changing the complexion of the business through active portfolio management to accelerate growth and drive value creation. As per management, for Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important next step in the company’s transition into a more streamlined company with a focus on greater and more optimized resource allocation towards innovation in profitable core businesses and where it sees attractive markets with opportunities to become market leaders.DownsidesPricing Pressure Continues to Persist: Pricing continues to remain a major headwind for Zimmer Biomet. During the second-quarter earnings call, the company noted that increasing inflationary pressure would pull through into 2023. The company expects about 50-100 basis points of headwind from inflation in 2023 versus the previous estimate of about 50 basis points.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is highly competitive with players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. Zimmer Biomet must constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Estimate TrendZimmer Biomet has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2022.

CAG is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Jan 5. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3,269 million, suggesting an increase of 6.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 65 cents per share. The projection indicates growth of 1.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.We expect second-quarter net revenues to be up 2.9% year over year to $3,219 million and the bottom line to jump 3.4% to 66 cents a share.Conagra Brands has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.8%, on average. This consumer-packaged goods food company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.6% in the last reported quarter.Conagra Brands Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseConagra Brands Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseConagra Brands price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Conagra Brands QuoteThings to ConsiderConagra Brands’ efficient pricing initiatives have been offering respite amid cost headwinds. Management expects the inflationary landscape to persist in fiscal 2023.Moreover, in fiscal 2023, CAG anticipates gross inflation (input cost inflation before hedging and other sourcing gains) in the low-teens range, which is likely to be weighted toward the first half of the year. To counter inflation, management unveiled an additional price increase in its last earnings release, which is likely to have been effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.We believe that efficient pricing, together with innovation, bodes well for sales. Prudent innovations have been helping the company modernize its portfolio and meet consumers’ changing needs aptly. Some of the company’s new products have been top-performing in several categories, such as toppings, plant-based protein and single-serve meals.Recovery in the Foodservice business, with restaurant traffic picking up, has also been a driver. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Foodservice segment’s sales advanced 14.6% to $274.9 million.With a continued rise in outdoor dining trends, the Foodservice business looks well-placed. Moving on, the strength of Conagra Brands’ frozen and snacks categories is noteworthy.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Conagra Brands this time.

With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight the persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s steepest annual loss since 2008, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with commodity prices soaring to new highs and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the year. The standout performers of 2022 were Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Energy Outperforms Amid CarnageAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the year deep in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while all others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index continued to move higher last year after comfortably topping the S&amp;P 500 leaderboard in 2021. It generated a total return of 58% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7%.Story continuesThe energy market continued to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity. The Biden administration’s ban on the import of Russian crude and energy products contributed to oil’s rapid price increase. Agreed, crude has pulled back from those lofty levels but with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution and the European Union putting a price cap on Russian oil exports — even at the cost of their economies — the oil bulls have got a fresh impetus.While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have been more than offset by the market’s precariously low level of spare capacity, China’s emergence from its strict COVID-19 restrictions, a stretched-out refining system, plus the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in 2022 and gained approximately 20% last year despite a steep selloff at the end of unseasonal warm weather projections for January. But overall, the commodity’s performance in 2022 was driven by a late-season cold and then a quick turnaround to summer heat in the United States, high demand in Europe (as the continent reduces its dependence on Russian gas) and strong LNG shipments.While most energy investors have had something to cheer about in 2022, some stocks certainly performed better than the others. The five largest contributors to the yearly sectoral gains were Occidental Petroleum, Hess, Marathon Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger.Will these winners maintain their run in 2023 too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Occidental Petroleum: Founded in 1920, Houston, TX-based Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY is also a producer of a variety of basic chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals.This stock handily outperformed all other companies and was up 117.3% during the period, ranking first on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Occidental continues to increase production from high-quality asset holdings and benefit from the acquisition of Anadarko, the American multinational might have run out of steam. In particular, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company‘s massive long-term debt of more than $20 billion and exposure to volatile commodity prices could limit further share price gains.Hess Corporation: Hess is a leading global integrated energy company. The company’s E&amp;P activities are concentrated in Denmark, Guyana, Canada, Suriname, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and the United States. Additionally, Hess provides gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting operations for both crude oil and NGLs.Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 91.6% last year. Its slew of discoveries in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, is a big positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Guyana is expected to become one of HES’ major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the energy operator’s rising costs and expenses, in addition to its relatively high debt-to-capitalization of 50.9%, can affect its financial flexibility. Finally, the dividend yield of Hess compares unfavorably to most of its peers and the S&amp;P 500.Marathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 81.9% in the past year. MPC’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement, per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the COVID lows, the continued increase in costs over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential for #3 Ranked MPC.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. XOM is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production, to refining and marketing.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 80.3% higher in the last twelve months. ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. With steadily increasing cash flows, XOM recently said that it will now buy back $50 billion of stock through 2024.However, the energy giant’s above-average capital spending program has got investors concerned. Also, the integrated energy major has been witnessing lower oil equivalent production volumes, which might affect the bottom line.Schlumberger: Schlumberger is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ended 78.5% higher in the January-December period. High commodity prices have increased demand for its services in energy markets across the globe. Schlumberger's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength, while its healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well.Additionally, its disciplined capital spending will likely benefit shareholders over the long term. While macro headwinds could still impact SLB’s EPS growth In 2023, it’s still a good investment for those interested in the energy market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

The optimism led by a solid third-quarter 2022 performance, along with potential in General Surgery, is expected to contribute further. Headwinds from regulatory requirements and data security threats persist.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 40.9% compared with 10.7% decline of the industry and 21.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global medical products manufacturer specializing in surgical instruments and devices has a market capitalization of $2.70 billion. The company projects 10.3% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in the other, the average surprise being 4.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Potential in General Surgery: CONMED’s continued strength in General Surgery raises our optimism. In the third quarter of 2022, revenues in the General Surgery segment improved robustly at constant exchange rate (CER). Domestically, General Surgery sales also rose year over year on a reported basis, while international sales at CER were also strong. According to the company’s investor presentation, global General Surgery products are anticipated to grow at above-market rates on a long-term basis on the back of additional sales representatives and improving customer engagement.Broad Product Spectrum: CONMED offers a broad line of surgical products, which includes several new devices in the Orthopedic, Laparoscopic, Robotic, Open Surgery, Gastroenterology, Pulmonary and Cardiology sections. Products like Hi-Fi Tape and Hi-Fi suture interface represent a critical component of repair security in the rotator cuff repair space.Other notable offerings include the MicroFree platform in Orthopedics, the TruShot, the Y-Knot Pro and the CRYSTALVIEW Pump. The Anchor Tissue Retrieval bag is a unique product under the General Surgery arm.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: CONMED’s solid third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed strong segmental performances across its Orthopedic Surgery and General Surgery units. It saw sales growth in domestic and overseas markets. The expansion of both gross and operating margins bodes well for the stock.DownsidesRegulatory Requirements: Substantially all of CONMED’s products are classified as class II medical devices subject to regulations of numerous agencies and legislative bodies worldwide. As a manufacturer of medical devices, the company’s manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on-site inspection and continuing review by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulations.Data Security Threats: CONMED relies extensively on information technology systems for storing, processing and transmitting its electronic, business-related information assets used in or necessary to conduct business. The data that the company stores and processes may include customer payment information and other types of sensitive business-related information.Estimate TrendCONMED is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 5.1% south to $3.15.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $306.5 million, suggesting an 11.9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fourth-quarter revenue estimate of $308 million, suggesting a 12.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

If you want to see more of the most valuable silicon valley companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World.Silicon Valley is a region in Northern California located around the San Francisco Bay Area that includes San Jose, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Plato Alto, Menlo Park, Cupertino, and also some other cities.Just as New York is known as the capital of finance, Silicon Valley has long been thought of by many as the capital of innovation. Given the region's history, many of the world's leading tech companies have their headquarters in the area.One reason for Silicon Valley's success is that the area has one of the world's leading universities located in the area in Stanford. Another world class university, Berkeley, is only 30 miles away. Another reason is that many of the world's top venture capital firms are based there such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. With smart founders, smart employees, and VC funding, many start ups have grown into giant world class companies today.Silicon Valley also benefits from being in the United States, which has the single largest economy in the world. By being American, companies headquartered in Silicon Valley have access to a huge market that could give them substantial economies of scale if they grow enough. Given the United States is the leader of the Western world, Silicon Valley companies also have access to many other developed markets as well.HistorySilicon Valley arguably started when William Shockley coinvented the transistor in the 1940s. Later, in 1956, Shockley would found Shockley Semiconductor Labs in Silicon Valley as the first company to make transistors out of silicon. In 1957, several Shockley employees would found Fairchild Semiconductor and later they would help found other leading tech companies such as Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and Kleiner Perkins.Story continuesAs a result of the semiconductor industry in Silicon Valley, the computer industry took off in the area in later decades. As a result of the concentration of computer companies and venture capital, the internet industry grew substantially in the area beginning in the 1990's and 2000's.2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has had to increase interest rates substantially in 2022 and many Silicon Valley tech companies have faced headwinds as a result. Although the tech industry as a whole has more growth in the future, there could be more downside for individual companies if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Intel, Semiconductor, ChipPhoto by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World, we took the 15 most valuable companies with headquarters in Silicon Valley from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest tech companies by market cap list.Because Silicon Valley is mostly known for its technology, we only included tech companies on our list.

U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino also sentenced Zheng to pay a $7,500 fine and serve one year of post-imprisonment supervised release.U.S. officials have said the Chinese government poses the biggest long-term threat to U.S. economic and national security, and is carrying out unprecedented efforts to steal critical technology from U.S. businesses and researchers. China denies the allegations.Zheng was employed at GE Power in Schenectady, New York, as an engineer specializing in turbine sealing technology. He worked at GE from 2008 until the summer of 2018, the Justice Department said.The trial evidence showed Zheng and others in China conspired to steal GE's trade secrets surrounding its ground-based and aviation-based turbine technologies to benefit China, including China-based companies and universities that research and manufacture parts for turbines, the Justice Department added.""This is a case of textbook economic espionage. Zheng exploited his position of trust, betrayed his employer and conspired with the government of China to steal innovative American technology,"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department's national security division.The United States had accused the former GE engineer and another Chinese businessman named Zhaoxi Zhang in 2019 of stealing secrets and spying on GE to aid China.

Work's transformation over the past few years has been marked by speed and urgency, which remain consistent variables influencing the road ahead. Shifts in the labor market and global economy have demanded a level of adaptability that's now become table stakes for employers. Employee expectations have shifted too – permanently – as workers rethink their priorities. This heightened focus on employee experience is influencing the way employers approach talent challenges in real-time, making the future of work even more fluid. To help businesses navigate forward, ADP experts highlight guidance, resources, and solutions focused on addressing the key themes shaping work's evolution in 2023.Dig deeper into what's shaping HR tech's transformation""Work this year will be about...delivering an employee experience that integrates people's full lives.""""Work has always been about people, and people aren't static,"" said Sreeni Kutam, president of global product and innovation at ADP. ""Their lives are continuously in motion, shaping the needs and the expectations they have of their employers. Work this year will be about listening and responding to those needs with greater urgency and delivering an employee experience that integrates people's full lives. That experience starts with recruitment and hiring, but it spans career growth and development, workplace experience, and health and wellbeing. At ADP we're focused on addressing these trends by tapping into data and providing intuitive and personalized tools that will help employers build meaningful connections with their people.""Key Drivers Shaping the World of Work People are forever changed and want work to be personal.It's not about leading by the rule, but rather the exception. The pandemic permanently shifted traditional expectations of the workplace, as workers – driven by social and economic stressors – have begun to rethink the notion of job security and how work fits into their lives. The resulting shifts in employee sentiment have left employers to navigate new expectations of flexibility, career choices and job roles, and purpose. In fact, according to ADP research, 76 percent of workers across all ages, income and education levels wanted earned wage access. Going forward, the tools people use at work will be more personalized, with employers leveraging offerings from personalized pay options like earned wage access to tailored career profiles to enrich the employee experience they deliver and drive talent engagement.Story continuesPeople are providing real-time feedback, expecting a real-time response.With the world constantly changing and largely digitalized, people have come to expect immediacy. When issues arise, they expect a swift and thorough response. Employee listening is a rising trend, with companies deploying survey tools and other real-time listening posts to tap into what's on their workers' minds so they can react and address feedback quickly. In fact, in a recent internal survey of ADP clients, employee survey capabilities surfaced as one of the top three priorities for HR practitioners. To respond meaningfully in real-time, it will be important for employers to leverage data-driven technologies to ensure they're asking the right questions at the right moments.People are empowered by data and expect transparency.With data readily available, there's greater expectations for companies to leverage it for good. With evolving legislation and compliance considerations around pay transparency and data privacy, employers will need to consider how data can impact their workforce. This includes a heightened focus on closing pay equity gaps and driving progress in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Since its launch, 70 percent of companies leveraging ADP's Pay Equity Storyboard have shown improvement in pay equity, returning an average of $4,000 or more in additional pay to over 400,000 workers deemed to be below benchmark from a pay equity perspective, for a cumulative impact of over $1.6 billion returned to communities. To continue driving progress, employers will need to tap into solutions that can provide benchmarks and insights continuously updated to reflect market trends, help them craft an action plan, and monitor for improvement.People want to work differently, demanding employers find innovative solutions.Having honed the ability to adapt over the past few years, employees expect new approaches from employers on how work gets done and how they can advance in their career journeys. Actively looking to grow, employees complete 29M learning courses through ADP each year. These expectations demand that employers graduate from embracing change to driving it within their organizations. Looking ahead, employers will need to explore ways to cultivate talent and unlock innovation at work, including AI-driven career pathing technologies to mine internal talent for development opportunities, prescriptive learning recommendations, and insights-driven team leader coaching to help employees stretch and develop needed skills.For more information on key drivers impacting the workforce in 2023, please register for our upcoming webinar here.About ADP (NASDAQ: ADP)Designing better ways to work through cutting-edge products, premium services and exceptional experiences that enable people to reach their full potential.  HR, Talent, Time Management, Benefits and Payroll.  Informed by data and designed for people.  Learn more at ADP.comADP, the ADP logo, and Always Designing for People, are trademarks of ADP, Inc.

A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is American Airlines (AAL). AAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. AAL has a P/S ratio of 0.18. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.48.Finally, investors should note that AAL has a P/CF ratio of 12.51. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 20.64. Over the past 52 weeks, AAL's P/CF has been as high as 36.69 and as low as -305.42, with a median of 14.63.If you're looking for another solid Transportation - Airline value stock, take a look at Delta Air Lines (DAL). DAL is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Furthermore, Delta Air Lines holds a P/B ratio of 4.59 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.08. DAL's P/B has been as high as 9.62, as low as 3.92, with a median of 5.71 over the past 12 months.Story continuesValue investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are likely undervalued currently.

Don't Ignore These 2 Finance Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002224.html,1672754402,STORY,['AFL'],"[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Aflac (AFL) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.26 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2023.AFL has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.13%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.26 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21.AFL is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE).Apple Hospitality REIT, which is readying to report earnings on February 28, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.33 a share, and APLE is 56 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple Hospitality REIT is $0.33, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.54%.Story continuesAFL and APLE's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

382,7ed0b55c-c364-33bd-a8c4-d23d6aced41b,FCX,2023-01-04,Investors Heavily Search FreeportMcMoRan Inc. (FCX): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-freeportmcmoran-inc-140002744.html,1672754402,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this mining company have returned -2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has lost 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -62.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -27.5%. This estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.68 indicates a change of -26% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -12.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.46 billion and $22.62 billion estimates indicate -1.7% and +0.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.8%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.89 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.75%. The EPS surprise was -23.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is evaluating a higher dose of aflibercept with less frequent injections in the targeted population. The successful label expansion of the drug in this indication will further propel sales and boost the top line.Regeneron is jointly developing aflibercept 8 mg with Bayer AG BAYRY. While REGN records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Regeneron’s top line is also boosted by its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent. Partner Sanofi SNY records global net product sales of Dupixent. Solid sales of Dupixent (approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis) have boosted the sales of the drug. Dupixent was recently approved by the European Commission (EC) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Regeneron is also looking to diversify in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The European Commission recently approved the label expansion of Libtayo as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. It was also approved in Japan for the same purpose.Story continuesRegeneron has approximately 35 product candidates in clinical development, including approved drugs being evaluated for additional indications. The FDA has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Evkeeza (evinacumab-dgnb) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies to treat children aged 5 to 11 years with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The FDA has set a target action date of Mar 30, 2023.Regeneron’s shares have gained 17% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 19.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, stiff competition from the potential entry of generics and new treatment options weighs on Eylea. While Libtayo holds promise, the competition is stiff in this oncology space with many formidable drugs. The contribution from REGEN-COV, a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab) — for COVID-19, has seen a massive decline in 2022 from 2021, thereby pulling down year-over-year growth.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
