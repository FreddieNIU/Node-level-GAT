If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.', ""The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace."", ""For instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance."", 'Additionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.', ""Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry."", 'At the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors. The notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)."", 'Photo by Sunrise King on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology ', ""To make our list of the stocks to buy in different sectors, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge fund portfolios and picked out stocks from Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare, Industrial, Communications, Consumer Cyclical, Consumer Defensive, Utilities, and Energy sectors with the highest hedge fund shareholders as of Q3 2023.

It\'s about to take a similar approach with its shares.', ""The giant retailer plans to conduct a 3-for-1 stock split on Feb. 26. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a press release that the company is taking this action to make its shares more affordable to its associates. Of course, shares will also be more affordable to investors who don't work for the company. Should you buy Walmart stock ahead of its stock split?"", ""Let me say right off the bat that it's probably not a great idea to buy Walmart shares just because of the upcoming stock split. Nothing will change about the company's underlying prospects when it increases the number of outstanding shares."", 'Yes, stock splits can sometimes cause a stock to jump. The idea is that the lower price results in heavier buying by retail investors who might have avoided the stock when it was more expensive.', ""However, such gains are usually temporary. That's been the case with Walmart in the past. The company has conducted nine stock splits in the past. The most recent occurred on April 20, 1999, when Walmart conducted a 2-for-1 stock split. Although shares rose moderately immediately after the split, all of the gains evaporated within a couple of weeks."", ""Although buying Walmart solely because a stock split is on the way isn't the best move, there are other good reasons to consider buying the stock. I'd put the company's competitive position near the top of the list."", 'Walmart ranks as the biggest retailer in the world based on revenue. It has textbook moats of cost advantages and economies of scale. The company generates strong cash flow. Few businesses are as resilient as Walmart.', 'The discount retailer also continues to deliver solid growth. Walmart reported 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2023. On a constant-currency basis, its revenue jumped 7.9%.', 'Walmart has multiple ways to continue growing. E-commerce especially stands out. The company is also expanding its global advertising business with revenue soaring 20% year over year in Q4.', ""Income investors have a lot to like with Walmart's dividend. The retail giant's dividend yield currently stands at 1.35%. Walmart joined the Dividend Kings club last year with its 50th consecutive year of dividend increases."", ""I think there's one main knock against Walmart for investors to consider. Its shares are relatively expensive -- and I'm not talking about the share price itself."", 'Walmart stock trades at nearly 24 times expected earnings. This forward earnings multiple is higher than the level from 30 years ago, when the company arguably had significantly greater growth prospects ahead of it.', ""Some investors could especially be concerned about Walmart's valuation with the company's near-term growth prospects. Walmart's 2024 guidance projects that revenue will increase by only 2.5% to 3% on a constant-currency basis."", 'My view is that Walmart remains a good pick for long-term investors.

Through its recent acquisitions of home health provider Signify, and primary care provider for seniors Oak Street, CVS is continuing to look for ways to create a closed loop for patients within its own system.', '""Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at risk lives an increase of 27% versus the prior year. Through January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled,"" said CEO Karen Lynch on the recent earnings call.', '""Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signify\'s strong capabilities in other products, including individual exchange and Medicaid,"" Lynch said.', 'Chief medical officer Sree Chaguturu told Yahoo Finance the company is ""building a world of health around every consumer.""', '""We are not looking to build the entire health care delivery ecosystem. But where we are choosing to build is where we believe there\'s the greatest opportunity to improve health outcomes. That\'s primary care, retail health, home services and physician enablement and accountable care — and that\'s helping physicians participate in value-based care,"" Chaguturu said in a recent, wide-ranging interview.', 'When asked if those services step on the toes of legacy providers, like hospital systems and physician groups, by taking market share away from less complex cases, Chaguturu said it was the opposite.', '""These are the most complex patients in our healthcare ecosystem, with multiple chronic diseases, and in addition to the chronic illnesses, many aspects of social fragility and social determinants of need,"" he said.', ""The company's recent earnings beat Wall Street expectations, reporting $93.8 billion in revenue for 2023, compared to an expected $90.7 billion. But it cut its 2024 outlook, expecting an expensive year ahead."", 'That includes increased utilization costs for Aetna Medicare Advantage patients as delayed services from the pandemic continue to come back, and pharmacy benefits managers, like CVS Caremark, becoming a target for lawmakers in Congress who are looking at ways to reduce the power of such ""middlemen."" Typically, such middlemen are blamed for increased costs in the health ecosystem, but Chaguturu says they will help in the rush of use of weight loss drugs.', 'The frenzy over GLP-1s, drugs that have been used for diabetics to help increase insulin production and help slow digestion, have been approved in the past few years for weight loss in obese patients.', 'Though GLP-1s, named for the hormone in the body they mimic, are not new, the latest formulations have had record weight loss results. That has spurred a rush of interest ranging from patients to online health platforms looking to take advantage of the trend by offering prescriptions.', 'Still, according to CVS, 80% of the prescriptions for the four top-selling drugs, from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), are for Type 2 diabetes patients.', 'Chaguturu said the PBMs will continue to drive down pricing to ensure access for more patients, and expects that more competition — which could begin as early as the end of this year — will also help drive down costs. CVS benefits by earning fees on the prescriptions of the drug it fills, as well as the rebates it gains from the drug manufacturers for covering the drugs and providing access to patients.', ""But it isn't an unfettered gold rush. CVS is working with hesitant customers, like insurers and employers, who worry about the increased costs. The roughly $1,000-per-month GLP-1 drugs have caused some employers and insurers to stop covering them, or to require prior authorization in order to fill the prescription."", 'That includes CVS\'s own insurer, Aetna, which told Yahoo Finance previously that, ""Prior authorization is required for coverage of these medications. This process allows our clinicians to review the request using evidence-based guidelines to ensure that coverage is appropriate given the member’s clinical status. The prior authorization process may include a review of the member’s age, body mass index, previous medical history and response to previous therapy.""', 'CVS is also building clinical support for the employers and insurers, to ensure patients who get prescriptions actually need them, and then providing support to manage any side effects, according to Chaguturu.', 'He said clients are taking a variety of approaches to GLP-1s, including waiting until prices come down, or until a way to ensure appropriate prescribing is in place, before agreeing to cover them.', '""In addition to bringing down pricing, we offer coverage and clinical solutions to help employers and health plans have access,"" he said.', 'He expects new competitors on the scene, driving the ability to bring down pricing per prescription and net cost of prescription over the coming years.', 'Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

The real estate investment trust (REIT) owns properties that produce durable rental income. That gives it the money to pay its attractive 5.8%-yielding monthly dividend.', 'The REIT has increased that payout 123 times since its public market listing 30 years ago. It should be able to continue growing it in the future. Driving that view is its ability to continue acquiring income-producing properties. That ability to pay a durable and growing monthly dividend makes it a great place to invest $100 right now. Investors could buy about two shares of a REIT that should produce a steadily rising stream of monthly dividend income. ', ""Realty Income recently unveiled its latest acquisition. The REIT is buying a portfolio of properties in Europe from Decathlon SE, one of the world's top sports companies and sporting goods retailers. Realty Income is purchasing 82 retail properties from Decathlon SE in a sale-leaseback transaction valued at 527 million euros ($578 million). It's the company's first pan-European transaction, with properties in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal. "", ""Those properties will supply Realty Income with incremental rental income to support its growing dividend. Meanwhile, the acquisition enhances the company's diversification by adding a new tenant with a strong operating history and financial position. The deal also furthers the company's European expansion by adding several new countries. Before the purchase, Realty Income's European portfolio included 354 properties across the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Ireland. The company will have now invested over $9.5 billion into building out its European real estate portfolio since entering the continent in 2019. "", 'Realty Income\'s initial sale-leaseback transaction with Decathlon could be the first of many between the two companies. ""We hope that this is the first step in a long and mutually beneficial global relationship between Decathlon and Realty Income,"" stated Neil Abraham, President of Realty Income International, in the press release unveiling the deal. Decathlon currently operates 1,751 stores across more than 70 territories worldwide, including 27 in Europe, 14 in Asia, and four in Latin America. Realty Income could acquire additional properties from Decathlon in future sale-leaseback transactions, further expanding its international operations. Future deals would also provide additional rental income to support dividend growth. ', 'The Decathlon deal is the latest in a string of value-enhancing investments by the REIT in recent months. It started 2024 on a strong note by closing its $9.3 billion acquisition of fellow REIT Spirit Realty. The company expects the merger to add over 2.5% to its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share this year. That puts it more than halfway to achieving its annual target of increasing its adjusted FFO by 4% to 5% per year. ', ""Realty Income's focus in recent years has been on increasing its scale through consolidation deals like the Spirit Realty merger and expanding its portfolio into new growth verticals (property types, investment platforms, and geographies). For example, in addition to expanding deeper into Europe, Realty Income has made investments in the gaming sector (Encore Boston and The Bellagio Las Vegas), credit investments (preferred equity investment in The Bellagio Las Vegas), and data centers ($200 million development joint venture with leading data center REIT Digital Realty). These investments will increase its adjusted FFO in the near term while providing it with new growth platforms to drive future cash flow and dividend growth. "", 'Realty Income is a great way to generate passive income from real estate. With its stock price recently around $50 a share, you can pick up a couple of shares for around $100. They will supply you with an attractive and growing income stream. With a nearly 6% yield and 4% to 5% annual adjusted FFO per share growth target, Realty income could generate double-digit total annualized returns in the future (enough to double your money every seven years).

Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com and we plan to file our Form 10-K next week.

It's hard for me to believe that I've been with the company for eight months already. Time has flown by, as I've gotten to know the fantastic employees of this company who are dedicated to serving our customers every day. Some of you have heard me say previously that I consider myself to be a good teller of great stories. While our employees have given me a great story to tell for 2023 and I'll do my best to tell it well. This morning, I'll provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. I will discuss some regulatory milestones that we recently achieved. We are also unveiling today an exciting capital investment program focused almost entirely on our wires business."", 'Over the next five years, we plan to invest $26 billion in our regulated system to improve reliability and the customer experience. This represents an increase of more than 44% compared to our last five-year plan. We will maintain our vigilance on affordability as our current rates are below our in-state peers. Jon will provide more detail on this later. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FirstEnergy delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.30 per share compared to a loss of $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating earnings for the quarter were $0.62 per share, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and compared to $0.50 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year 2023, the company delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.96 per share and operating earnings of $2.56 per share, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range.', 'Employees work diligently throughout the year to overcome significant headwinds. The impact of market conditions on our pension plan created an earnings drag of $0.30 per share and unusually mild weather impacted earnings by $0.28 per share. Through our continuous improvement program, employees were able to drive base O&M down over $200 million or 14% versus 2022. Half of those savings are sustainable and this tremendous effort buoyed our full year results by $0.32 per share, allowing us to meet our operating earnings targets. In 2023, the company put $3.7 billion of CapEx to work to improve reliability and the customer experience. This was 16% more than was invested in 2022 and 9% more than budget. 93% of the 2023 CapEx was invested directly into our wires businesses.', 'Our projects and construction organizations were able to take advantage of the improving supply chain environment and the mild weather to put the incremental dollars to work. 2023 was a game-changing year for the company in terms of strengthening its balance sheet to enable future investment and growth and are mostly wires regulated business. In February 2023, the company announced a second transaction with Brookfield to sell 30% of FET for $3.5 billion. With the successful completion of our Pennsylvania consolidation, and the anticipated order approving the filed settlement of the transaction, we are on track to close on this asset sale by the end of March. At that time, we will receive the majority of the proceeds in cash with the balance to be paid before the end of the year.', 'In May, we successfully executed a $1.5 billion convertible debt issuance at a 4% coupon. We used these proceeds to pay down debt and make a $750 million contribution to our pension assets. In late December, we executed a $700 million pension lift-out representing over 8% of our total pension liability and reducing volatility in our pension plan by 10%. Our improved financial condition gave the Board the confidence to raise the targeted dividend payout ratio to 60% to 70% of operating earnings. In September, the Board had the confidence to raise the quarterly dividend for the first time in more than three years. Of course, subject to Board approval, our 2024 plan includes dividend declarations of $1.70 per share versus $1.60 per share in 2023.', ""This represents a 6.25% increase. Going forward, we anticipate growing our dividend with operating earnings growth. The significant improvement in our balance sheet puts FirstEnergy energy in a growth and investment mode. The fact that we do not expect incremental equity to fund our CapEx growth beyond our employee benefit programs differentiates FirstEnergy for many of our peers. We are introducing a $26 billion five-year capital investment program to improve reliability and our customers' experience. We are branding this program, Energize 365 and John will provide more details in his remarks. These investments should enable 9% average annual growth in rate base over the period. We are guiding to $4.3 billion of investment in 2024, an increase of 15% over 2023."", ""Energize 365 represents a significant increase in our investments and rate base with improved earnings quality. We expect to maintain a strong customer affordability position versus our in-state peers. We are reaffirming our 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth rate.

The midpoint is 7% above 2023's operating earnings guidance midpoint. Turning to slide 6. Let's take a look at our regulatory calendar. One of the questions investors have asked is, how will we know what FirstEnergy can obtain fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes? The answer that we have given is, to look for milestones in our near-term results."", 'In 2023 and early 2024, we have achieved several milestones demonstrating constructive regulatory outcomes. Let me highlight a few. As we mentioned in our last call, we received a reasonable outcome in our Maryland distribution rate case. The commission there approved a $29 million revenue increase that supports equity returns of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 53%. We are pleased to serve and invest in Maryland to provide reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. In West Virginia, we filed a settlement in our ENEC case with staff of broad intervener support for a recovery of $255 million over three years with a carrying cost after year one. The settlement has no disallowances. In January of this year, we filed a settlement in our base rate case with staff and broaden and leaner support for $105 million rate adjustment based on a 9.8% allowed ROE and 49.6% equity ratio.', ""This settlement reflects the $700 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2014. Of course, we did not get everything we asked for, but the settlement is fair and constructive and it demonstrates West Virginia as an attractive place to invest for our customers. In New Jersey, JCP&L filed a base rate case settlement last Friday, with staff and broad intervener support that reflects an $85 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of 9.6% and a 52% equity ratio. The settlement reflects the $400 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2021. The settlement will have a modest 3.4% increase in the average residential bill and JCP&L's rates will be 26% below our in-state peers. If approved, the settlement will be a fair and reasonable outcome that will incentivize JCP&L to make investments to improve customer reliability."", ""In Pennsylvania, we received an order in December, improving the consolidation of our Pennsylvania operating companies and approving the transfer of West Pan Power's transmission assets to CATCo. Both transactions were executed on January 1 of this year. We are awaiting commission approval of the filed settlement for the bit minority interest sale, which is anticipated soon. We anticipate filing a base rate case in Pennsylvania by April. For investors looking for milestones of FirstEnergy's ability to receive reasonable and constructive regulatory outcomes, these recent examples provide convincing evidence. In Ohio, we are actively working our way through our ESP 5 and Grid Mod 2 cases. We are fully engaged in the regulatory process with staff and interveners and expect constructive outcomes in both cases."", 'We plan to file a base rate case in May. Turning to slide 7. I want to briefly review the new segment reporting that FirstEnergy will adopt in 2024, to reflect how we are managing the company. Individual companies will not be split among the segments, leading to simplicity and transparency in reporting as well as accountability and management. Our Distribution segment will house our Ohio and Pennsylvania pure-play distribution-only companies. Our Pennsylvania consolidation and the transfer of the West Penn Power transmission assets to KATCo make this segment transparent and clean. This segment will represent about $10.9 billion in rate base serve 4.2 million customers, and account for about 45% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. A senior executive will lead each of FE Pennsylvania and Ohio.', 'Our integrated business segment will report on JCP&L, Potomac Edison and Mon Power, our companies with combinations of distribution, transmission and generation. This segment will represent about $8.7 billion in rate base, serve 2 million customers, and account for about 35% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. A senior executive will lead JCP&L and another will leave Mon Power and Potomac Edison. Our last major business segment will be standalone transmission and it will house our pure-play transmission-only companies, consisting of our ownership interest in FET as well as KATCo. This segment will represent about $7.7 billion in consolidated rate base, and account for about 20% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. One executive will be responsible for these businesses.', ""Finally, the Corporate and Other segment will be similar to the current segment with Aetna. It will report holding company interest, legacy investments, former subsidiaries and pension and OPEB. A recast of 2023 into the new segments is available in our fact book and we will provide quarterly and year-to-date reconciliations throughout 2024. Let me provide some key updates on Slide 8. In regard to the Ohio organized crime investigations Commission, there's nothing new to report. We continue to cooperate with the commission and answer any questions they ask. The deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ details FirstEnergy's involvement and there is nothing new with respect to the company. In the updated climate strategy published to our corporate responsibility website yesterday, we are providing an update to our greenhouse gas emissions goals."", ""In 2020, we set a goal of achieving net carbon neutrality by 2050, with an interim goal of reducing our Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. Achieving the 2030 interim goal was predicated on meaningful emissions reductions at our Fort Martin and Harrison power plants in West Virginia, which account for approximately 99% of our greenhouse gas emissions. We've identified several challenges to our ability to meet that interim goal, including resource adequacy concerns in the PJM region and state energy policy initiatives. Given these challenges, we have decided to remove our 2030 interim goal. Through regulatory filings in West Virginia, we have forecast the end of the useful life of Fort Martin in 2035 and for Harrison in 2040. We remain focused on achieving our aspirational goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050."", 'In the fourth quarter of last year, we made two-key additions to our leadership team. In November, we announced our hiring of Toby Thomas, as Chief Operating Officer. Toby joined us from American Electric Power, where he spent more than two decades in various leadership positions, including growing and managing one of the largest wires businesses in the country. He is responsible for system planning and protection, transmission, substation and engineering, project and construction management and system operations. Wade Smith joined the company in December, as the President of FirstEnergy Utilities. He was previously the Chief Operating Officer of Puget Sound Energy. Wade brings more than three decades of experience running large-scale multi-state transmission and distribution companies.', 'The presidents of our five operating businesses will report to him. Ohio, Pennsylvania, JCP&L, our standalone transmission business and Mon Power and Potomac Edison. We are actively reviewing internal and external candidates to run these businesses and expect to make hiring announcements in the coming months. Wade and Toby are key additions to the leadership team that will grow and transform this company into a premier electric utility. In 2023, and continuing into 2024, we have made transformational strides to improve the financial strength of FirstEnergy. We have organized our company with a singular focus on growing our five regulated, mostly wires companies. We are making the investments needed to improve reliability and the customer experience.', 'Our strong balance sheet and organic investment opportunities differentiate FirstEnergy for many of our peers. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon.', ""Jon Taylor: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm also very proud of our performance in 2023, and I'm excited to turn a new page in our company's history. Today, I'll briefly review our 2023 results, but more importantly, discuss our enhanced five-year plan and 2024 guidance. Our results in 2023 speak to our employees' dedication and tremendous performance, which included strategic and transformational initiatives, while doing the hard work to meet our financial commitments in a very challenging year and emerge as a stronger, more nimble company. Since I've been at the company, I can't recall a more challenging year in terms of the financial headwinds we faced including the most abnormal weather conditions that I can remember, the extremely volatile interest rate environment and a significant impact on our pension plan from the interest rate and equity market performance in 2022."", ""But at the same time, our employees demonstrated their grid and resiliency to overcome these adversities while making strategic advancements to improve our operational and financial performance. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.62 a share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.50 a share. For the year, operating earnings were $2.56 a year, also above the midpoint of our guidance range. This represents 7% growth of 2022's guidance midpoint and compares favorably to operating earnings of $2.41 a share in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year results are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website last night. As we pointed to throughout the year, we largely offset the headwinds I mentioned earlier through a strong focus on reduced operating expenses across each of our business units."", ""The deployment of proceeds from the low-cost convertible debt offering in the spring and certain tax benefits realized in the third quarter. Our focus on operating expenses across the company resulted in a 14% or over $200 million reduction year-over-year, representing a $0.32 per share year-over-year benefit. As we've discussed, about 50% of that represents unique items or work that was accelerated in 2022 from 2023, the other 50%, which largely includes productivity improvements across the company, lower contractor usage, and reduced corporate spending on areas such as branding and advertising are sustainable reductions to our cost structure. Our 2023 results benefited from our formulary investment programs across our transmission and distribution businesses, which resulted in a $0.20 per share improvement year-over-year."", 'As Brian mentioned, we successfully deployed $3.7 billion of capital in 2023, about $300 million or close to 10% above our original capital investment plan for the year. In our transmission business, earnings increased $0.08 a share or close to 10% for the year, primarily from our investment programs, which resulted in rate base growth of 9% compared to 2022. Formula rate investments in our transmission business were $1.8 billion, an increase of 28% compared to 2022 and $100 million or 6% above our original plan due to emergent projects. In our distribution business, earnings declined year-over-year, primarily from the lower weather-related distribution sales and the lower pension credit I spoke of earlier, but also reflect the impact of our formula rate investment programs, new rates that went into effect in Maryland in mid-October, higher weather-adjusted demand, and lower operating costs that I spoke of.', 'Distribution CapEx of $1.9 billion represents an increase of 5% compared to 2022, and exceeded our original plan by $220 million or 13% as part of our planned increases we announced last year. Finally, in our Corporate segment, 2023 results benefited from lower O&M and a consolidated effective tax rate of about 16% versus nearly 21% in 2022, mostly as a result of planned use of state net operating loss carryforwards. And a final point on 2023, as Brian discussed, we executed a $700 million pension lift-out in December, representing about 8% of our total pension liability associated with our former generation subsidiaries. Removing this obligation from our balance sheet at a 5% discount will reduce future earnings volatility related to fluctuations in pension assets and liabilities and lowers overall pension plan costs.', ""We will continue pursuing opportunities to further derisk the pension plan through additional lift-outs and pursuing pension tracking mechanisms through the regulatory process. Now, let's shift gears and talk about our outlook going forward. We are very pleased to introduce our five-year financial plan supporting our commitments to our investors, including 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth with significantly improved earnings quality, investment-grade credit metrics, and dividend growth in line with earnings growth. The cornerstone of this plan is a robust Energized 365 grid evolution investment plan of $26 billion, with approximately 75% of planned investments in formula rate programs that provide real-time returns. The plan includes increasing annual investments in our transmission and distribution system each year, resulting in 9% average annual rate base growth."", ""Energize 365 supersedes our long-standing Energizing the Future transmission program, which we're sunsetting after a decade of strong performance. Our planned targets investments that improve the customer experience and supports the energy transition or new load requirements, while ensuring a fair and reasonable regulated return for our investors. The capital program is 45% weighted in FERC-regulated transmission investments in our stand-alone transmission and integrated businesses, and includes investments to enhance and upgrade the transmission system, add operational flexibility to support projects like New Jersey offshore wind and new data center load and regulatory required projects. On the distribution system, the plan includes investments by our distribution and integrated segments to improve the customer experience through reliability enhancements, grid modernization and clean energy investments such as smart meter deployment, distribution automation and energy efficiency programs."", 'This comprehensive five-year instrument plan is very solid with flexibility to adjust as projects and programs emerge. Over the next couple of years, we anticipate an increase in earnings from our formula rate investment programs and as we rerate base distribution rates for over $19 billion of state regulated rate base. Our plan builds off the approved or settled base rate cases in Maryland, West Virginia and New Jersey, our integrated segment, representing $7 billion in rate base that was earnings 400 basis points below the allowed returns, as well as scheduled base rate cases in Pennsylvania and Ohio later this year, where we have $12 billion in projected rate base in our distribution segment. It is also forecasted to be under earning. The true-up of returns will allow us to earn closer to our allowed regulated returns and to significantly improve the earnings quality of the company with the expected declines in the earnings contribution from Signal Peak.', ""In longer term, annual rate base growth with planned investments in formula rate programs, more timely recovery of base capital investments and cost discipline with our operating expenses will result in less regulatory lag than we've seen historically with modest and reasonable customer bill impacts. We expect our utilities to maintain their strong affordability position and keep rates at/or below our in-state peers. Energize 365 will be funded with cash from operations, which we expect to average $4 billion-plus annually, building off our 2024 cash flow projections, as well as regulated long-term debt issuances and a portion of the $3.5 billion in proceeds from the FET transaction. And our plan does not include any incremental equity needs beyond our existing employee equity programs and it supports FFO to debt of 14% to 15% and FE Corp debt at/or below 20% of total debt."", ""Our 2024 guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 a share represents a 7% increase off the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which will largely be back-end loaded given the timing of new rates in West Virginia and New Jersey and O&M mark plan for Q1 of this year. With this in mind, our projection for the first quarter are operating earnings of $0.48 a share to $0.58 a share. To give you some color on the year-over-year increase, our midpoint of $2.71 a share reflects 12% consolidated regulated growth offset by a decline in Signal Peak's earnings contribution. The increase reflects new rates and investments largely from approved or settled base rate cases in our integrated segment, where we anticipate new rates for our West Virginia and New Jersey settlements to be implemented late in the first quarter and ongoing formula rate investments in each of our businesses."", ""A return to normal weather-related customer demand, higher operating expenses reflecting the timing of O&M activities that I spoke of earlier, and new depreciation rates on our fossil generating facilities as part of the settlement we reached in West Virginia. It's important to note that our 2024 planned O&M is $140 million or 10% below 2022 levels. And when you adjust for timing such as planned generation outages, our O&M is $100 million or 6% below 2022, reflecting permanent cost reductions. Other drivers include improved earnings quality from the lower earnings contribution from our Signal Peak mining asset and a higher effective tax rate. The dilution from the FET transaction is largely offset by lower interest expense, representing planned debt retirements and interest income from the vendor take-back note as part of the FET transaction."", ""Our $4.3 billion capital investment plan for this year represents a 16% increase compared to 2023. And is largely funded with $4 billion in cash from operations, which has improved year-over-year from several unique items that occurred in 2023, such as the $750 million pension contribution, contract termination costs and severance and employee separation costs, as well as increases from growth and cost recovery in our regulated businesses and improved working capital. With the improvement in cash flow, closing on our FET minority interest sale and deployment of those proceeds, we're targeting 14% to 15% FFO to debt by year-end. 2023 was a challenging but remarkable year, a year of significant transition, innovation and improvement with outstanding operational and financial execution from our 12,000 employees."", ""Today, our company is a much stronger position, and we have a comprehensive plan for continued growth. Thank you for your time today. But before we go to Q&A, I'll turn the call back over to Brian."", ""Brian Tierney: Thank you all for joining us today. I'm excited about our company. We're building a strong track record of execution. We have a fantastic business model and a robust plan for the future. Starting with the initial Brookfield and Blackstone investments announced in late 2021, we have significantly improved the balance sheet via $7 billion in equity capital, and it was raised in a very shareholder-friendly manner, the equivalent of issuing common equity at $87 per share. In the past year, we've achieved several important regulatory milestones, representing constructive outcomes for FirstEnergy and our customers. This includes $219 million of increased revenues through base rate cases that will fuel our investments in reliable and affordable service."", ""Energize 365, our five-year $26 billion investment plan is an increase of more than 44% from our previous five-year capital investment plan and it's funded with organic internal cash flow and utility debt, not incremental equity. We have a long-term 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth trajectory with significantly improved earnings quality. This tremendous work together with the cultural changes and focus on continuous improvement has transformed our company. We have accomplished a lot and we're committed to executing on our plan to deliver the full value of this company to shareholders. Now, let's open the call to your questions."", 'See also 13 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy and 12 Safest Places to Retire in Mexico.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 3.4% to hit US$1.9b. Ralph Lauren reported statutory earnings per share (EPS) US$4.19, which was a notable 18% above what the analysts had forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Ralph Lauren after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren ', ""Following the latest results, Ralph Lauren's 19 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$6.90b in 2025. This would be a satisfactory 4.5% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to step up 19% to US$10.91. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.85b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$10.66 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""The consensus price target rose 18% to US$177, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Ralph Lauren at US$244 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$113. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Ralph Lauren's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 3.6% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 1.8% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.1% per year.

And that doesn't include the value of the dividends it has paid."", 'And those dividends, by the way, have grown steadily over the course of the past decade, from $0.03 per share per quarter back in early 2014 to $0.24 per share per quarter now.', ""Veteran investors may recall the fallout from 2008's subprime mortgage crisis hit banks hard, and BofA was no exception. Not only did the situation force the bank to cut its previously generous dividend payment down to a nominal $0.01 per share for several years, Bank of America shares are still priced below their pre-crisis peak. It's a reasonable argument for not owning a stake in this (or any other) bank ever again."", ""Don't jump to long-term conclusions about an industry based on temporary, extraordinary circumstances, though. Yes, banks should have known better than to extend so many risky loans facilitating purchases of overpriced homes. The world still needs banks more than it doesn't, however, and as long as there's money, there's a profit to be earned by being in the banking business. Bank of America's sheer size keeps it positioned to win at least its fair share of this business."", ""To simply call Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) a software company is a bit of an understatement. It's arguably the software company. Numbers from GlobalStats indicate Microsoft's various Windows operating systems are installed on 73% of the planet's computers. Even if the company didn't offer any other software, it would still be one of the planet's best-positioned gatekeepers to the internet. Other software companies still code their software to first and foremost work with Windows."", ""Microsoft, of course, doesn't stop at operating systems. Its office-productivity software like Word, Excel, and Outlook accounts for about half of this market, according to numbers from technology market research outfit Enlyft. It's not just its dominance of all things PC that makes Microsoft a name worth owning for the long haul, either. The software giant is a key player in the cloud computing market as well. Synergy Research Group reports Microsoft's share of the global cloud infrastructure market grew to 24% last quarter, up from only 15% as of the end of 2018. That not only makes it the fastest-growing cloud computing operation over that time frame but puts it within reach of Amazon's market-leading 31% share. Then there are Microsoft's Xbox video gaming brand, LinkedIn, search engine Bing, a few artificial intelligence projects, and a bunch of other business services you might not even realize Microsoft offers."", ""Sure, the company's highest-growth days are likely in the past. Its revenue model is also evolving. Much of its software is now rented rather than outright purchased, which supports more predictable revenue, but at growth rates below those seen during the company's heyday in the 1990s and early 2000s."", 'Take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. All of its products and services are going to be just as necessary a few decades from now as they are now. By offering access to its tools and tech via affordable monthly subscriptions, Microsoft is ensuring it will remain a market leader well into the future.', ""Last but not least, add credit card middleman Mastercard (NYSE: MA) to your list of stocks to buy and hold if you'd like a shot at retiring with $1 million."", ""You know the company. In fact, if you have any credit cards at all, then odds are good you're a customer. Roughly 43% of adults in the United States carry a Mastercard card. Globally, it processes a quarter of credit card transactions. The company handled nearly 171 billion transactions last year, facilitating the purchase of more than $7.3 trillion worth of goods and services. That translated into $25.1 billion worth of 2023 revenue for Mastercard, and net income of $11.2 billion."", ""Yes, credit card networks are incredibly profitable. They always have been -- a detail too many investors seem to overlook. But what does the future hold for Mastercard's business?"", ""It's not an unfair question to ask. Most of the company's potential growth has already been tapped, after all. Insider Intelligence reports that debit cards are now used about as often as cash is on a worldwide basis, with credit cards not being far behind. Digital wallets are in the mix as well. Cash is even less frequently used within the United States. On balance, the now-relatively modest overall use of cash seemingly limits how much new business any credit card company will be able to win going forward."", ""Mastercard has an edge when it comes to setting itself up for continued growth, however. That's its willingness and ability to innovate -- including innovations that don't directly drive more revenue-bearing card transactions."", 'As an example, did you know that Mastercard operates a consulting business that helps merchants get a better handle on how they can adapt to the ongoing evolution of AI? The company is also in the music business. Its Artist Accelerator arm is helping artists use artificial intelligence and other music-making digital tools -- including some made by Mastercard itself -- to create songs. And, just last month, the company announced a partnership with Indian healthcare tech company Remedinet aimed at streamlining cashless payments being made by insurers to hospitals.', 'None of these efforts will inspire consumers to whip out their cards any more than they already are. All of these initiatives, however, ensure Mastercard is positioned to capitalize on whatever the future holds for the payments business.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them.

That's a signal for some that it's time to invest elsewhere."", 'In reality, a dividend is mostly just a signal that management may not see as many investment opportunities, so instead of wasting the money or letting it sit in its coffers, they return funds to shareholders. That should be a signal for investors to get into the stock.', 'When talking about tech companies, particularly software companies, this is the point where their high operating leverage generates more and more revenue every year without a significant increase in operating expenses. So when a tech company starts paying a dividend, it\'s more often a signal that it\'s reached ""escape velocity"" so to speak, and that leverage will start producing a lot more free cash flow and earnings well into the future.', ""That's been quite evident in the returns Microsoft has produced since it first declared a dividend in 2003."", 'Microsoft declared its first dividend for shareholders on Jan. 16, 2003, alongside its second-quarter earnings report for that year. The dividend, paid annually, was $0.16 per share, or just $0.08 per share after the stock split in February of that year.', 'A lot has changed at Microsoft since then.', 'In 2003, Microsoft was generating the bulk of its revenue from sales of the Windows operating system and Office suite. The two combined to account for about 60% of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2003. Its server platform business was focused on providing software tailored toward different enterprise applications. It also had a burgeoning home and entertainment segment bolstered by Xbox.', 'Total revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2003 was $16.3 billion, which resulted in a profit of $5.3 billion and $8.9 billion in cash from operations.', 'Microsoft looks a lot different today.', ""Microsoft's biggest segment these days contains that server platform business. It also added Github, a code repository for software developers. However, the biggest driver of the segment is its Azure cloud computing platform. The product didn't even exist in 2003, but it's become the driving force behind Microsoft's business over the past decade. The segment accounted for over 40% of revenue through the first half of the year, and it's the fastest-growing reporting segment at the company."", 'Meanwhile, Microsoft has seen shifts in its Office business, which is now largely a software-as-a-service subscription business. Windows is lumped in with its devices and gaming segment, which recently added Activision Blizzard to the mix.', ""In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (July to December 2023), Microsoft generated almost $119 billion, resulting in $44 billion in net income and $49 billion in cash from operations. That's a sevenfold increase in sales and an eight-fold increase in net income since 2003."", ""If you bought shares of Microsoft the day after it announced its dividend (since it was announced after the bell), the most you'd pay would be $53 per share. Let's say you bought 19 shares for $1,000. After the stock split in February 2003, you'd have 38 shares."", 'Those 38 shares are now worth about $15,700.', ""But that's just the half of it. Microsoft also paid you a dividend every year."", ""Total dividends received from those 38 shares would amount to $1,067 in that time. That's right, you'd have received more in dividends than your original investment. But if you'd chosen to reinvest those dividends instead, you'd have seen your total investment climb to about $24,800. That's over $8,000 more than if you took your dividends in cash."", ""Microsoft's total return over the last 21 years blew away the S&P 500. $1,000 invested an S&P 500 index fund would've turned into a respectable $8,300, but that's just one-third of what you'd have today by investing in Microsoft."", ""Microsoft continues to show strong momentum, producing tons of profit and cash flow for shareholders. It's consistently raised its dividend most years, now paying $3 per share annually."", ""The outlook remains strong, as its investment in OpenAI put it in a leading position in drawing AI developers to its Azure platform. It's one reason shares remain attractive even as they trade around their all-time high."", ""But there's a broader lesson for investors in Microsoft's story. Investing in a tech company when it declares a dividend can be a great idea as the company begins leveraging fixed costs and growing earnings. What's more, it's not an admission that it has no better way to invest cash to grow the company -- see the growth of Azure, the transformation of Office, and the acquisitions of LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard."", 'That should point investors to take a closer look at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), which just initiated a dividend alongside its fourth-quarter earnings release.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the social media leader announced on Feb. 1, 2024 that it's initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. This translates to a dividend yield of around 0.44%. It's not great, but it's a start."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) trails Meta as Tepper's second-largest position. Appaloosa owned 1.64 million shares of the technology giant at the end of the third quarter of 2023, enough to make up nearly 10.2% of the hedge fund's portfolio."", ""Many big tech companies don't pay dividends.

Appaloosa owned 1.02 million shares of Nvidia at the end of Q3."", ""Unlike Amazon, Nvidia pays a dividend. Granted, it's not a huge one: The chipmaker's dividend yield is only 0.02%. Still, the company has increased its payout by 88% since initiating a dividend program in 2015. With a dividend payout ratio of barely over 2%, the company could easily boost its dividend a lot more if it chooses."", ""Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is Appaloosa's ninth-largest holding, lagging behind several stocks that don't pay dividends. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the hedge fund owned 6.25 million shares of Intel, representing nearly 4.4% of its portfolio."", ""Ordinarily, Intel's dividend yield of close to 1.2% wouldn't be anything to get excited about. Compared to most of Tepper's top holdings, though, this yield looks fantastic."", ""However, there's a yellow flag to note: Intel slashed its dividend payout by more than 65% last year as part of a larger cost-cutting effort."", ""Not every dividend stock that Tepper owns is in the tech sector.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has jumped 41% so far, maintaining its blistering pace from 2024, and Meta Platforms, another big winner last year, is up 33%.', 'The strong start is the latest evidence that investors are living through another iteration of the dot-com boom when the Nasdaq Composite jumped 582% from the start of 1995 to its peak in March 2000.', 'One well-regarded tech analyst has called the new tech boom multiple times, touting that ""It\'s 1995."" That\'s Wedbush\'s Dan Ives. At least since last June, Ives has said we\'re in another 1995 moment, explaining in a recent post on X: ""In my opinion we are on the doorstep of an internet moment with AI that will transform tech forever. Will change the growth trajectory of the tech sector.""', 'The internet is one of the most important transformational innovations in history, and in a generation it has reshaped the way we communicate, entertain ourselves, work, and shop.', 'It would be a tall task for any new technology to achieve a similar transformation, but many of the top tech CEOs believe that artificial intelligence (AI) could be equally transformative, if not more so. Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison, who has been in the industry since the early days of the computer, said: ""Is generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Probably."" Tesla CEO and tech visionary Elon Musk has said that AI has the potential to be the most disruptive force in history, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates called AI the most revolutionary technology in decades', ""In addition to the forecasts from tech's biggest luminaries, it's also clear that analysts can't keep up with the soaring growth from companies like Nvidia, which has surged past expectations in every quarter since the launch of ChatGPT."", ""The current predicament in the tech industry offers further evidence that the AI boom is only just starting. Nvidia's revenue and profit have surged in spite of a shortage of its products. There is more demand than the company can fill, and hyperscalers, start-ups, and others need its processors to run the powerful models required for generative AI."", 'It will be hard to judge the potential of AI until every company that wants the necessary infrastructure has it, but demand is clearly surging right now.', 'Billionaire investor George Soros famously advised, ""When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy.""', 'It might be too early to call the rally in AI stocks a bubble, but the most obvious plays are often the best ones in these situations, much like stay-at-home stocks such as Zoom Video Communications and Peloton were big winners in the early stages of the pandemic.', ""By that same logic, Nvidia still looks like a good choice in the AI revolution. The stock's gains over the past year aren't built on air. Its profit has soared because its technology is in high demand, and its processors are well ahead of the competition. While some expect that gap to close, there are also signs competitive dynamics could move in the opposite direction as Nvidia presses its competitive advantage. For instance, it unveiled new AI PC chips in January, threatening to take market share in a category that Intel\xa0has long led."", ""Nvidia also seems well priced, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 33 based on this year's earnings estimates. If the company can exceed that target, the stock will surely move higher."", ""Microsoft looks like another easy AI stock to own. While the company doesn't have the same direct exposure to AI demand that Nvidia does, it seems to be the company that's best positioned to benefit from AI in a diverse set of ways. Its partnership with OpenAI has already paid off significantly as its AI-based Copilot is in programs such as Azure, Office 365, Bing, and GitHub. The company said on its recent earnings call that AI was responsible for six additional percentage points of growth, helping it outpace its competition, and it now has 53,000 Azure AI customers."", ""Microsoft's early lead also ensures that its highly profitable core product will remain relevant and in demand, helping to block out potential competition."", ""Finally, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is the third AI stock worth buying for a new tech boom. Like Nvidia, Supermicro has found itself in the envious position of making hardware that helps run AI-based models like those that ChatGPT uses. Supermicro makes server and storage equipment that's in high demand in the AI revolution, driving revenue up 103% in its most recent quarter, and the company is currently supply constrained since it relies on Nvidia chips, meaning that growth could be even stronger."", 'Like Nvidia, Supermicro is also profitable and trades at a reasonable forward P/E of just 31. Those estimates could easily move higher if supply improves.', 'If Ives is right and this is 1995, then there should be plenty of winners in the AI boom. Investors are best off focusing on stocks that are solidly profitable and already clearly benefiting from AI.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.', ""The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace."", ""For instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance."", 'Additionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.', ""Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry."", 'At the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors.

Through its recent acquisitions of home health provider Signify, and primary care provider for seniors Oak Street, CVS is continuing to look for ways to create a closed loop for patients within its own system.', '""Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at risk lives an increase of 27% versus the prior year. Through January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled,"" said CEO Karen Lynch on the recent earnings call.', '""Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signify\'s strong capabilities in other products, including individual exchange and Medicaid,"" Lynch said.', 'Chief medical officer Sree Chaguturu told Yahoo Finance the company is ""building a world of health around every consumer.""', '""We are not looking to build the entire health care delivery ecosystem. But where we are choosing to build is where we believe there\'s the greatest opportunity to improve health outcomes. That\'s primary care, retail health, home services and physician enablement and accountable care — and that\'s helping physicians participate in value-based care,"" Chaguturu said in a recent, wide-ranging interview.', 'When asked if those services step on the toes of legacy providers, like hospital systems and physician groups, by taking market share away from less complex cases, Chaguturu said it was the opposite.', '""These are the most complex patients in our healthcare ecosystem, with multiple chronic diseases, and in addition to the chronic illnesses, many aspects of social fragility and social determinants of need,"" he said.', ""The company's recent earnings beat Wall Street expectations, reporting $93.8 billion in revenue for 2023, compared to an expected $90.7 billion.

Typically, such middlemen are blamed for increased costs in the health ecosystem, but Chaguturu says they will help in the rush of use of weight loss drugs.', 'The frenzy over GLP-1s, drugs that have been used for diabetics to help increase insulin production and help slow digestion, have been approved in the past few years for weight loss in obese patients.', 'Though GLP-1s, named for the hormone in the body they mimic, are not new, the latest formulations have had record weight loss results. That has spurred a rush of interest ranging from patients to online health platforms looking to take advantage of the trend by offering prescriptions.', 'Still, according to CVS, 80% of the prescriptions for the four top-selling drugs, from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), are for Type 2 diabetes patients.', 'Chaguturu said the PBMs will continue to drive down pricing to ensure access for more patients, and expects that more competition — which could begin as early as the end of this year — will also help drive down costs.

And if you believe Sysco should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Sysco’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy.

Results overall were respectable, with statutory earnings of US$4.87 per share roughly in line with what the analysts had forecast. Revenues of US$1.8b came in 6.5% ahead of analyst predictions. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from TransDigm Group's 21 analysts is for revenues of US$7.71b in 2024. This would reflect a meaningful 10% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 12% to US$27.31. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$7.63b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$28.17 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year."", ""Althoughthe analysts have revised their earnings forecasts for next year, they've also lifted the consensus price target 7.3% to US$1,182, suggesting the revised estimates are not indicative of a weaker long-term future for the business. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic TransDigm Group analyst has a price target of US$1,380 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$705. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting TransDigm Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 14% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 6.3% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.5% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that TransDigm Group is expected to grow much faster than its industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for TransDigm Group going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.."", ""And what about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for TransDigm Group   (of which 2 are potentially serious!) you should know about."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Phillips 66, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$7.9b ÷ (US$78b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Thus, Phillips 66 has an ROCE of 13%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 37% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 13%. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", 'To sum it up, Phillips 66 has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.', 'On a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  you should be aware of.', ""While Phillips 66 isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

But for defense stocks in particular, earnings season wrapped up with a blockbuster report from Huntington Ingalls. Now that the noise has died down, it's time to start looking for winners and losers within the sector."", ""And with its shares up 7.3% since earnings were released last month, it's clear that General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) is one of the biggest winners."", ""Shares of the defense major, known mainly as a builder of naval warships for the Navy, and armored vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps (with a nice side business building Gulfstreams for civilian jet-setters) were buoyed by strong Q4 sales growth, up 7.5% to $11.7 billion. They weren't hurt badly by earnings, either -- although those rose less than 2% to just $3.64 per share."", ""That may have been an indication of investors' happiness with any growth at all in GD's Q4 earnings. For the full year, the company produced sales growth similar to what we saw in Q4 (7.3%, to $42.3 billion) -- but its earnings actually declined by 1.4%, to $12.02 per share. The fact that General Dynamics was able to boast of Q4 as producing its best-ever earnings per share, and its best-ever quarterly revenue as well, also may have contributed to investors' satisfaction with the results."", ""The question for investors now is whether General Dynamics will be able to keep the sales growth going in the New Year. And even more importantly, will be it able to turn around last year's lackluster earnings, and resume growing its profit as well?"", ""Unfortunately for investors, that's not at all a rhetorical question. Because in several respects, the trends do not appear to be particularly good friends to General Dynamics. Consider:"", ""Growth performance across this defense giant's several divisions was decidedly mixed. While the company's highest-profile marine systems (warships) and combat systems (tanks and APCs) divisions enjoyed strong double-digit sales growth, the operating profit margin at both divisions in 2023 declined versus 2022."", ""As a matter of fact, the only division that grew its profit margin at all in 2023 was General Dynamics' historically high-profit-margin civilian aerospace business, which builds Gulfstream jets. Sales growth there, however, was entirely lackluster, at less than 1%. Showing similarly weak performance was General Dynamics' IT-focused Technologies division, which grew its sales barely 3% year over year, and suffered a 50-basis-point decline in profit margins."", ""Overall, General Dynamics' operating profit margin across its four divisions declined by 70 basis points to 10%, its weakest profit margin since 2012."", ""Yet for investors considering a new position in General Dynamics stock, I'm not sure that's necessarily a bad thing."", ""On one hand, yes, weak profit margin sapped much of the potential for GD to grow its earnings last year. On the other hand, when it comes to cyclical defense contractors, I'm actually more leery of a high profit margin than of a low one, because when these kinds of companies get too profitable, it's often a signal that they've got nowhere to go but down. In contrast, with General Dynamics now earning a profit margin significantly lower than the 13.5% rates it was achieving in 2015 and 2017, for example, I suspect the company might be able to eke out some improvements in margin if it tries."", ""This is especially true when you consider that when it comes to the armored-vehicles market, the company really doesn't face a whole lot competition. Aside from America's Textron and Britain's BAE Systems, General Dynamics is pretty much the only game in town when the U.S. Pentagon, absolutely, positively feels it needs to buy a few more main battle tanks or armored personnel carriers. And it's even more true when it comes to building military warships. Huntington Ingalls is GD's biggest rival in that field, and as we saw last week, profit margins are moving on up for Huntington Ingalls lately."", ""I'd expect we'll see a similar dynamic at General Dynamics before long."", 'Long story short, at a P/E ratio of 22.3 and a price-to-sales ratio of 1.8, General Dynamics is not currently my favorite defense stock to own. I do believe the stock is still too expensive, and I wouldn\'t be surprised to see it fall further if the profit margin continues to get squeezed. Longer term, however, I see the potential for profit margins to turn around, and for this stock to become a ""buy"" once again.', ""I'm just waiting for the right price to make that happen."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Dynamics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Dynamics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Dynamics wasn’t one of them.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Wynn Resorts' shares on or after the 16th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.00 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Wynn Resorts has a trailing yield of 0.9% on the current share price of US$105.60. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Wynn Resorts is paying out just 12% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Wynn Resorts, with earnings per share up 3.9% on average over the last five years. Growth has been anaemic. Yet with more than 75% of its earnings being kept in the business, there is ample room to reinvest in growth or lift the payout ratio - either of which could increase the dividend."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Wynn Resorts has seen its dividend decline 22% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy."", 'From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Wynn Resorts? Wynn Resorts has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Wynn Resorts ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.', ""While it's tempting to invest in Wynn Resorts for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

Masco reported US$8.0b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.02 beat expectations, being 5.5% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Masco ', ""Taking into account the latest results, Masco's 22 analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$8.02b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$4.08, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$7.98b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.93 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Masco's earnings potential following these results."", ""The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 11% to US$77.62. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Masco at US$89.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$59.50. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Masco's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 6.9% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 5.1% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Masco."", 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Masco following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.', ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Grand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will soar 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030. That implies an annual growth of 37% over that time frame.', 'Investors can capitalize on that opportunity by purchasing individual AI stocks. But that strategy requires quite a bit of work. Before buying a stock, investors should thoroughly research the underlying business. Additionally, investors must keep tabs on all the companies they own over time to ensure their investment theses remain sensible.', ""Alternatively, investors can buy AI index funds. It's a strategy that requires much less work. Index funds are ready-made portfolios that spread capital across many different companies. While it simplifies the work, investors must still investigate any index funds they want to own to ensure their capital is spread across the right companies at a reasonable price."", 'To help in that research, here is one AI index fund worth buying, and three AI index funds to avoid.', 'When investors think about artificial intelligence (AI), I doubt an S&P 500 index fund is the first thing that comes to mind. However, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is an excellent way to capitalize on the growing demand for AI because it has a more favorable risk-reward profile than most index funds.', 'How does the S&P 500 relate to AI? A total of 152 S&P 500 companies discussed AI during third-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet. Not all of them will use AI in a way that creates value for shareholders, but some will undoubtedly monetize the technology to great effect.', 'Consider the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the percentage share of the overall fund:', 'Apple: 7%', 'Microsoft: 7%', 'Alphabet: 3.8%', 'Amazon: 3.4%', 'Nvidia: 3%', 'Of those five companies, four are very well-positioned to monetize AI. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are the largest cloud services providers in the world. That means all three should benefit as businesses provision cloud infrastructure to develop AI applications. Moreover, all three have introduced generative AI assistants that extend their ability to monetize AI.', ""Similarly, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in machine learning. The company has also expanded its ability to monetize AI by branching into data center networking equipment, central processing units (CPUs), subscription software, and cloud services -- all purpose-built for AI."", 'Another reason the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a compelling investment is that very few index funds beat the benchmark over time. In fact, just 20% of large-cap funds outperformed the S&P 500 over the last three years, and just 13% outperformed over the last five years, according to S&P Global.', 'Finally, the S&P 500 has been a surefire moneymaker for patient investors. The index has produced a positive return over every rolling 20-year period in history, and it has never failed to recover from any correction, bear market, or recession. Moreover, the S&P 500 returned 241% over the last decade, compounding at 13% annually. At that pace, $100 invested weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would have grown into more than $100,000.', 'When selecting an index fund, investors should ask themselves two questions. First, has the index fund in question consistently outperformed the S&P 500? If the answer is no, think twice about buying it. Settling for underperformance is nonsensical in most cases.', 'Second, is the index fund in question expensive? The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF bears an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.03%, meaning investors would pay just $3 per year in fees on a $10,000 portfolio. It would be silly to pay much more unless the index fund has handily outperformed the S&P 500 in the past.', 'With that in mind, investors should avoid the following index funds.', 'The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ: BOTZ) measures the performance of 42 stocks. Its two largest holdings, Nvidia and Intuitive Surgical, account for 20% of its weight. The index fund underperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, three, and five years. It also bears an above-average expense ratio of 0.69%.', 'The Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKQ) measures the performance of 36 stocks. Its two largest holdings, Tesla and UiPath, account for 20% of its weight. The index fund underperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, three, and five years. It also bears an above-average expense ratio of 0.75%.', 'The iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEMKT: IRBO) measures the performance of 111 stocks. Its two largest holdings, Nvidia and Meta Platforms, account for just 3% of its weight. However, the index fund still underperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, three, and five years. It also bears an above-average expense ratio of 0.47%.', 'Investors need not choose to hold just index funds or individual stocks. A blended strategy is perfectly acceptable. In other words, investors could split their money between an S&P 500 index fund and a select group of AI stocks. That strategy is attractive because it leaves room for outperformance but it also limits downside.', ""Specifically, an investor would beat the S&P 500 if their individual stocks outperformed. But their portfolios wouldn't fare too badly even if their stocks underperformed, provided they allocated enough money to an S&P 500 index fund. Remember, the S&P 500 returned 13% annually over the past decade. It also returned 10% annually over the past three decades."", 'Personally, I prefer the blended approach. Buying individual stocks lets me take a little extra risk, but I balance that risk with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

In a pair of Earth-shaking announcements last week, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) informed Congress of a plan to sell a combined $31.6 billion in new weapons sales to Greece and Turkey.', 'But the biggest of these deals is for Turkey.', 'As you may already know, DSCA is the Pentagon department responsible for coordinating sensitive weapons sales between U.S. defense contractors and foreign governments. Turkey says it wants these new fighter jets to ""expand and modernize"" its air force, which currently comprises primarily older F-16C Falcon and F-4E Phantom fighter jets. Before this sale can go through, though, the U.S. State Department must sign off on the deal as supporting ""the foreign policy goals and national security of the United States"" and unlikely to ""alter the basic military balance in the region"" -- in this case, southern Europe -- and Congress must either approve or reject the sale.', ""That's the stage we're at in this process right now."", 'Absent a refusal by Congress, therefore, Lockheed Martin will be named the ""principal contactor"" on a deal to sell Turkey 40 brand-new F-16 fighter jets. It will also upgrade 79 F-16s that Turkey already owns to a new F-16V (for ""Viper"") configuration.', 'Adjacent to this work, Lockheed will coordinate the delivery of some 48 F110-GE-129D engines from General Electric (NYSE: GE), along with radars, navigation systems, missile launchers, and auto-cannons -- and more than 3,000 assorted bombs, missiles, and ""smart bomb"" guidance kits from a whole series of other U.S. defense contractors.', 'Total cost for all this hardware: $23 billion.', ""And that's not all."", 'Greece also wants to ""modernize its air force."" So simultaneous with the Turkey announcement, DSCA advised Congress of a corresponding deal to arm Turkish neighbor Greece with 40 new F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets. Here, Lockheed Martin will share the principal contractor role with fellow defense contracting heavyweight RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX), which makes the F135 engines that power the F-35, on a sale worth $8.6 billion.', ""In contrast to the Turkey deal, no upgrades will be involved in this sale. (This will be Greece's first purchase of the F-35, after all.) Greece also isn't buying a lot of ordnance, which helps to further explain the sale's smaller size -- although Greece is buying 42 Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 engines from RTX, and additional weapons purchases may follow. Also on the horizon may be even more sales of the F-35 as the country's F-4E and Mirage 2000 aircraft age out of service, and potentially upgrades of Greece's own F-16 fleet (which like Turkey's comprises primarily older F-16C variants)."", 'So keep an eye on that as an opportunity for future Lockheed Martin sales.', ""As for now, the $31.6 billion in total revenue that will flow through Lockheed Martin across these two weapons deals is quite large enough to move the needle on this defense contractor. Even assuming that much of this revenue will ultimately end up at other defense companies, if we apply Lockheed Martin's operating profit margin (10.2% for its aeronautics unit, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence) to the revenue at first point of impact, these two deals alone have the potential to generate in excess of $3.2 billion in operating profit."", ""That's more than one full year's worth of profit for the aeronautics division, and more than 36% of all the profit that Lockheed Martin earned across all divisions in 2023."", ""So what does this mean for investors? Well, it ultimately depends on how long it takes Lockheed to deliver these 80 new fighter jets to (and upgrade 79 more for) its customers. But we seem to be looking here at a combined 47% increase in sales and 36% boost in earnings compared to Lockheed's 2023 sales and earnings. Spread that out over even, say, five years, and I anticipate this weapons deal has the potential to more than double the 3.2% annualized earnings growth rate that most analysts have penciled in for Lockheed Martin."", ""Long story short, analysts' forecasts for Lockheed Martin's growth rate are too low. And Lockheed Martin's stock price should therefore go higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ', 'As you can see below, at the end of December 2023, Lockheed Martin had US$17.5b of debt, up from US$15.5b a year ago.

Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.44b as well as receivables valued at US$15.3b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$28.9b.', 'Lockheed Martin has a very large market capitalization of US$103.1b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""With a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.6, Lockheed Martin uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the alluring interest cover (EBIT of 9.9 times interest expense) certainly does not do anything to dispel this impression. Also positive, Lockheed Martin grew its EBIT by 21% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Lockheed Martin can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Lockheed Martin recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Happily, Lockheed Martin's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its EBIT growth rate also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Lockheed Martin's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin  you should be aware of."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

In this article, we decided to focus on TE Connectivity's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for TE Connectivity is:', '25% = US$3.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""First thing first, we like that TE Connectivity has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for TE Connectivity's moderate 6.2% net income growth seen over the past five years."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that TE Connectivity's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'TE Connectivity has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.', ""Moreover, TE Connectivity is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 28% of its profits over the next three years. However, TE Connectivity's future ROE is expected to decline to 19% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio."", ""On the whole, we feel that TE Connectivity's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

I write a lot about companies that build military equipment. So imagine my surprise when, last week, I learned that one of the companies I follow most actively -- Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) -- may have a military aircraft that's worth up to $100 billion in future revenue."", ""And it's an aircraft whose development has been kept so secret that I'd almost forgotten it even existed."", 'Rumored for more than a decade, the aircraft in question -- an unpiloted drone called the RQ-180 -- made its first real-world appearance in a single random photo snagged by a freelance photojournalist in California in 2020. Further details on the top-secret drone appeared on Medium.com last year, describing the RQ-180 as the culmination of a 20-year-long U.S. Air Force effort to build a ""flying wing"" stealth drone that is ""invisible to enemy radars, infrared sensors, and acoustic detectors, and [able] to fly at high altitudes and long ranges.""', ""Impressive as that already sounds, here's the real kicker for defense investors: According to a new story from Britain's The Telegraph, the RQ-180 stealth drone could add as much as $100 billion to the $200 billion B-21 bomber contract that Northrop Grumman won in 2015."", 'How does this math work?', 'When Northrop Grumman entered its candidate (colloquially known at the time as the ""B-3 bomber"") to replace the Air Force\'s current fleet of B-2 stealth bombers, it envisioned the bomber acting in concert with unmanned stealth drones. These drones would range ahead of the bomber at very high altitude, identifying both anti-aircraft defenses to avoid and targets for the bomber to attack from a safe distance.', 'Thus, the B-21 Raider actually needs to be thought of as just one half (if the more expensive half) of ""a stealthy hunter-killer team"" (emphasis added).', 'Several media outlets confirm that the B-21 Raider will cost approximately $750 million per unit sold. Multiplied by an anticipated 100 to 200 bombers, and factoring in inflation, The Telegraph estimates that the actual cost could approach $200 billion -- the equivalent of five full years of revenue for Northrop Grumman across all its divisions.', 'But here\'s the thing: Calculating that the Air Force will need ""a couple of dozen RQ-180s"" to back up its bombers, The Telegraph argues the actual value of Northrop\'s contract to build both the B-21 Raiders and the RQ-180 drones to accompany them could add $100 billion (i.e., 2.5 more years\' worth of revenue) to Northrop Grumman\'s top line.', 'And that estimate may prove conservative. As a more ""expendable"" vehicle than the piloted B-21, it makes sense that the RQ-180 will be less expensive to manufacture than its piloted partner. And if the drone is both more expendable and cheaper, it makes sense that the Air Force would order more RQ-180s than B-21s -- not fewer. This implies that the revenue opportunity from building RQ-180s might be even greater than what The Telegraph surmises.', ""Granted, there's always the risk that the B-21 bomber program will get cut short before the Air Force ever buys 100 -- much less 200 -- of the airplanes. Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor fighter jet program, for example, famously set a target of 750 airplanes to be produced when its contract was initially awarded in 1991, but cost overruns ended the program prematurely, and ultimately fewer than 200 planes were built."", 'Or consider the case of Northrop\'s B-2 Spirit bomber, the plane the B-21 will replace. The Air Force originally asked Northrop to build 132 B-2 bombers, but as costs ran wild, the program was canceled with just 21 aircraft in service. Ultimately, the B-2 ended up costing $2 billion per unit, forever tagging it as the plane that ""literally cost its weight in gold.""', ""That should not happen with the B-21, however. Unlike the F-22 and B-2 development programs, which were awarded largely under cost-plus contracts, the B-21 program is fixed-price -- an intentional move on the Pentagon's part to prevent the kinds of cost overruns that have terminated other weapons programs prematurely. On the one hand, this has caused Northrop Grumman to incur sizable losses on its first batch of planes built for the Air Force. On the other hand, it may help to ensure that all of the originally desired planes actually end up getting built because the government won't have to worry about costs ballooning over time."", 'Early losses on this contract, due to its fixed-price nature, will certainly sting investors in the short term. But in the longer term, the more planes Northrop ends up building, the more time it will have to make back those early losses -- both from B-21 sales and the RQ-180. Additionally, the more planes that are ultimately built, the more money Northrop should make from servicing, maintaining, and upgrading these planes as well.', ""How much money will Northrop end up getting? This remains to be seen. But according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the company's revenue in 2023 was just under $40 billion. If $300 billion is just the starting point for revenue estimates from the B-21 and RQ-180 programs, I'd say Northrop is off to a very good start."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Northrop Grumman right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Northrop Grumman, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Northrop Grumman wasn’t one of them.

It's the single factor that separates this company's products, which are really just commoditized clothes and shoes, into a profitable revenue stream. If we look out even 10 or 20 years from now, I'm positive that Nike's success will be predicated on how relevant the brand stayed."", ""This business is one of the best marketers in the world. Powerful marketing campaigns attempt to resonate and build deep connections with customers, while exuding a winning mentality. Superstar athletes help the cause. From Michael Jordan in the 1980s (a partnership still thriving today), to LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Serena Williams, and Cristiano Ronaldo more recently, Nike is known for its high-level athlete endorsements. This keeps the brand's visibility extremely high."", ""The result is a gross margin that has averaged 44.7% in the last decade, showcasing customers' willingness to pay up for what Nike is selling. And there is some pricing power here. In the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), average selling prices increased, according to CFO Matt Friend."", 'Management is focused on maintaining the brand image, which is the right strategy. The goal is to try to grow direct-to-consumer sales and rely less on ineffective wholesale retailers.', ""But perhaps the best move is to continue investing in Nike's digital foundation. The company's various digital apps have hundreds of millions of members in total, providing the business with a way to directly engage and communicate the brand's message."", ""Five years ago, the Greater China market was Nike's fastest-growing by far.

There are local home-grown brands, like Anta Sports Products and Li Ning, that are finding great success among the population. Consequently, Nike may be losing share in a country that's supposed to be its most important market outside the U.S. "", ""When reporting fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter results, Nike executives laid out a long-term financial outlook, which stated some high-level goals the business hoped to achieve by fiscal 2025. Revenue growth of high single digits to low double digits is the goal that I'll call out, as it's directly influenced by demand trends."", ""As we are currently halfway through fiscal 2024, it's discouraging for investors to know that the company is coming up well short of this target. Revenue was up by just 1% in the latest quarter. It increased by 4.9% in fiscal 2022 and 9.6% in fiscal 2023. Management expects sales to increase by 1% for the current year.

That cash has been used to fuel a series of acquisitions, business deals, and product development.

If you want to skip our discussion of the gene editing industry, head directly to Top 5 CRISPR Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', ""Genome editing refers to a set of technologies enabling scientists to modify an organism's DNA by adding, removing, or altering genetic material at specific locations in the genome, as defined by MedlinePlus. One prominent method is CRISPR-Cas9, derived from bacteria's natural immune defense system against viruses. In this system, bacteria create CRISPR arrays by incorporating small pieces of viral DNA. If the viruses return, the bacteria use RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to recognize and bind to specific regions of the viral DNA. The enzyme Cas9 then cuts the DNA, disabling the virus. CRISPR-Cas9 stands out for its speed, cost-effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency compared to other genome editing methods."", 'CRISPR has broad medical applications. For example, Swedish researchers utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the rs10071329 genetic variant in human brown adipocytes, transforming it from A/A to G/G. This alteration increased PPARGC1B levels, resulting in elevated triglyceride accumulation, enhanced mitochondrial gene expression, improved mitochondrial respiration, and a heightened lipolysis response to norepinephrine. These findings suggest the potential of PPARGC1B genetic variants as therapeutic targets for precision medicine in obesity. Meanwhile, Chinese researchers demonstrated prime editing using CRISPR-Cas12a and circular RNAs in human cells. They developed circular RNA-mediated prime editor (CPE) systems targeting T-rich areas, enabling potential multiplex editing with efficiencies reaching up to 40.75% in human cells.', 'The valuation of the global CRISPR Cas9 market was $2480.95 million in 2022, and it is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.05% through the forecast period, reaching $14395.61 million by 2028. Cell and gene therapies show potential for treating or curing certain cancers and rare diseases, though they are among the most expensive treatments globally, with some costing between $400,000 and $2 million per dose. Despite the high costs, the Cell and gene therapies market is anticipated to nearly quadruple over the next three years, increasing from $5.3 billion in 2022 to an estimated $19.9 billion by 2027.', ""2023 marked a significant breakthrough for cell and gene therapies, with seven FDA approvals in the US and one in the European Union. The global landscape includes over 2,000 ongoing clinical trials, with approximately 10% in Phase III, suggesting that around 75 therapies could be approved well before 2030. Projections for 2024 estimate approximately 17 approvals in the US and EU combined. Presently, there are 33 approved cell and gene therapy products listed on the FDA's website, with seven of them gaining approval in 2023. These include treatments for sickle cell disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, wounds in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) patients, severe hemophilia A, neutrophil recovery, and type 1 diabetes using innovative cellular and gene-based approaches. In 2024, experts expect the initial approval of adoptive cell therapy for solid tumors and the first approval of an allogeneic T-cell therapy in the United States."", 'To benefit from the growth potential in the gene editing market, some of the stocks to invest in include Pfizer Inc.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown."", ""Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings."", ""Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan."", ""Lachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Against the backdrop of an active news cycle and another robust fall sports schedule, our fiscal second quarter again illustrated the strength of Fox. The growth we delivered in affiliate fee revenues was the standout this quarter, with the Television segment growing by 10% and the Cable segment returning to growth, once again demonstrating the power of our brands and our programming. We now largely completed our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewal cycle, having achieved our commercial goals without disruption and setting a solid foundation for renewals in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter were down, primarily due to comparisons to last year's major cyclical events, including the mid-term elections at the TV stations and the broadcast of the Men's World Cup in the Cable and Television segments."", 'Parsing through the cyclical comparisons, our concentration in News and Sports coupled with the outstanding performance at Tubi is clearly an advantage in a mixed advertising environment. More specifically, sports advertising was very healthy during the quarter and we saw particularly strong demand for the NFL and College Football, which continued into the NFL playoffs. At News, the second quarter was more nuanced, while preemptions and the direct response market adversely impacted quarterly growth, we sequentially narrowed the gap between the current and prior year in ratings and in pricing. We were also able to increase our viewing share over the previous quarter, and the positive trends in share ratings and pricing have carried over into the current quarter.', 'See also 15 Best Inexpensive Tequilas Under $40 that Don’t Taste Bad and 15 Best Rums Under $40.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS — and hadn’t fled to the kitchen for snacks — found themselves watching something completely different.', 'In between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, “Big Brother,” addressed them on a massive screen.', 'Extolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated freedom from “pests of any contradictory true thoughts.”', 'Then, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.', ""Wearing a white tank top and red shorts — and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) — she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother’s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'”"", 'Happy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.', 'Created by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), “1984” elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.', 'Though Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. “It marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,” he told Yahoo Finance recently.', '“It was,” he added, “the first time where the audience went, ‘Wait, wait, wait, don\'t go to the bathroom. Let\'s stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.\'""', 'But Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.', 'IBM = Big Brother?', 'In the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.\xa0In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,\xa0named after Steve Jobs’ daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM’s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.', ""“Apple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit … the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,” said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington."", 'But then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to “stop the world in its tracks” and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job.', 'Along with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline ""Why 1984 won\'t be like \'1984,\'"" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 “like the Jetsons.” But the ad’s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.', '“He came and looked at our initial board … he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,\xa0the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,” Hayden explained. “And so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.”', 'The advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and ""break the spell,"" Hayden said.', 'A new age', 'The heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O’Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “I think it\'s telling that she\'s dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she\'s running for the United States,"" she said.', 'The heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts — think mainframes and IBM —\xa0the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.', '“She was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,” Hayden said.', ""Added Chiat/Day’s Schwartz: “You have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business … When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us … and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.”"", ""But there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. “I had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,” he said. “It didn't match the traditional advertising forms.”"", 'But Jean-Louis Gassée, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recalls\xa0the first time he saw the ad at a 1983\xa0meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. “We had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],” he told Yahoo Finance. “So we could hear what became the highly recognizable “bong” of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.”', 'Though Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended “Big Brother” to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a “fiery” anti-IBM speech, “saying that the Macintosh would change the world,” according to Gassée. “It was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.”', 'Holding up', 'It is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla’s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.', 'At least Jean-Louis Gassée sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and Google. It serves as “a good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.”', 'He added: “I think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.” he said. “So this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.”', 'Enjoy the Super Bowl.', 'Dylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.']"

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase KLA's shares before the 15th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 1st of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.45 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, KLA stock has a trailing yield of around 0.9% on the current share price of US$649.80. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether KLA has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for KLA ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately KLA's payout ratio is modest, at just 27% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 23% of its cash flow last year."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see KLA's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 31% per annum for the past five years. KLA is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. KLA has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years."", 'Is KLA an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? KLA has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.', ""In light of that, while KLA has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for KLA that we recommend you consider before investing in the business."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

While that process continues, here are two exciting AI stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade."", ""The boom in AI last year cast a bright spotlight on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business as its cutting-edge chips became the preferred hardware for AI developers and cloud infrastructure providers everywhere."", 'Its years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training AI models, positioned it to immediately begin supplying hardware to countless AI-minded firms as the market exploded. Nvidia got a head start over rivals like AMD and Intel\xa0and snapped up an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs.', ""Soaring chip sales have sent Nvidia's revenues, operating income, and free cash flow skyrocketing over the last year, propelling its stock up over 215%. The company's free cash flow hit more than $17 billion, significantly higher than AMD's just over $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion."", ""So, despite new GPU releases from both of those rival chipmakers, Nvidia's early advantages in AI have potentially pushed it further ahead, with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy."", ""Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio and price-to-earnings ratio have declined by double-digit percentages in the last six months. And when it comes to these metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value."", 'As a result, now is an excellent time to make a long-term investment in Nvidia that will allow you to benefit from consistently rising demand for its AI GPUs.', 'Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are up 65% since last February, in part due to its significant financial growth and exciting prospects in AI.', 'The company posted its fourth-quarter results last week. Revenue rose 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings per share hit $1.00, compared to the expected $0.80.', ""Over the last 12 months, impressive growth has sent Amazon's free cash flow soaring by 904% to $32 billion."", ""The tech giant's e-commerce business has also returned solidly to growth. However, the best reason to invest in its stock is its highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As the world's leading cloud infrastructure provider, it has the potential to leverage its massive data centers and steer the generative AI market in its favor."", 'Over the last year, AWS has responded to the rising demand for AI services by expanding its offerings. For instance, in September, the company debuted Bedrock, a tool that offers a range of models that customers can use to build generative AI applications. AWS also introduced CodeWhisperer, a platform that generates code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool capable of transcribing patient-to-physician conversations.', ""In fiscal 2023, AWS accounted for 67% of Amazon's operating income despite delivering the lowest revenue of its three segments. As it continues to expand its AI services, Amazon could be in for consistent earnings boosts long into the future."", ""Based on current estimates, Amazon's earnings could hit just under $7 per share in two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by its forward P/E of 41 yields a stock price of $279.

Nope. The hedge fund manager (and Carolina Panthers owner) probably doesn't factor dividends into his thinking much, if at all, when picking stocks."", ""However, that doesn't mean Tepper doesn't own plenty of dividend stocks. There are more of them in the billionaire's Appaloosa Management hedge fund than you might think. He's invested 38% of his portfolio in these five dividend stocks."", ""Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) ranks as the top holding in Tepper's Appaloosa hedge fund. As of Sept. 30, 2023, it owned 1.95 million shares -- more than 11.5% of the overall portfolio at the time."", ""Until recently, Meta wouldn't have made a list featuring Tepper's dividend stocks. However, the social media leader announced on Feb. 1, 2024 that it's initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. This translates to a dividend yield of around 0.44%. It's not great, but it's a start."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) trails Meta as Tepper's second-largest position. Appaloosa owned 1.64 million shares of the technology giant at the end of the third quarter of 2023, enough to make up nearly 10.2% of the hedge fund's portfolio."", ""Many big tech companies don't pay dividends. Microsoft, though, initiated a dividend program way back in 2003."", 'Its dividend currently yields 0.74%. The company has increased its dividend payout by an impressive 168% over the last 10 years.', ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't the third-largest position for Tepper.

Appaloosa owned 1.02 million shares of Nvidia at the end of Q3."", ""Unlike Amazon, Nvidia pays a dividend. Granted, it's not a huge one: The chipmaker's dividend yield is only 0.02%. Still, the company has increased its payout by 88% since initiating a dividend program in 2015. With a dividend payout ratio of barely over 2%, the company could easily boost its dividend a lot more if it chooses."", ""Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is Appaloosa's ninth-largest holding, lagging behind several stocks that don't pay dividends. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the hedge fund owned 6.25 million shares of Intel, representing nearly 4.4% of its portfolio."", ""Ordinarily, Intel's dividend yield of close to 1.2% wouldn't be anything to get excited about. Compared to most of Tepper's top holdings, though, this yield looks fantastic."", ""However, there's a yellow flag to note: Intel slashed its dividend payout by more than 65% last year as part of a larger cost-cutting effort."", ""Not every dividend stock that Tepper owns is in the tech sector. Federal Express (NYSE: FDX) ranks as his 10th largest position. As of Sept. 30, 2023, Tepper's hedge fund owned 650,000 shares of FedEx, making up 3.4% of its portfolio."", ""FedEx's dividend yield of over 2.1% is quite respectable. So is the company's payout ratio of under 29%."", ""Arguably, the best thing about FedEx's dividend program is its track record of dividend increases.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has jumped 41% so far, maintaining its blistering pace from 2024, and Meta Platforms, another big winner last year, is up 33%.', 'The strong start is the latest evidence that investors are living through another iteration of the dot-com boom when the Nasdaq Composite jumped 582% from the start of 1995 to its peak in March 2000.', 'One well-regarded tech analyst has called the new tech boom multiple times, touting that ""It\'s 1995."" That\'s Wedbush\'s Dan Ives. At least since last June, Ives has said we\'re in another 1995 moment, explaining in a recent post on X: ""In my opinion we are on the doorstep of an internet moment with AI that will transform tech forever. Will change the growth trajectory of the tech sector.""', 'The internet is one of the most important transformational innovations in history, and in a generation it has reshaped the way we communicate, entertain ourselves, work, and shop.', 'It would be a tall task for any new technology to achieve a similar transformation, but many of the top tech CEOs believe that artificial intelligence (AI) could be equally transformative, if not more so. Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison, who has been in the industry since the early days of the computer, said: ""Is generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Probably."" Tesla CEO and tech visionary Elon Musk has said that AI has the potential to be the most disruptive force in history, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates called AI the most revolutionary technology in decades', ""In addition to the forecasts from tech's biggest luminaries, it's also clear that analysts can't keep up with the soaring growth from companies like Nvidia, which has surged past expectations in every quarter since the launch of ChatGPT."", ""The current predicament in the tech industry offers further evidence that the AI boom is only just starting. Nvidia's revenue and profit have surged in spite of a shortage of its products. There is more demand than the company can fill, and hyperscalers, start-ups, and others need its processors to run the powerful models required for generative AI."", 'It will be hard to judge the potential of AI until every company that wants the necessary infrastructure has it, but demand is clearly surging right now.', 'Billionaire investor George Soros famously advised, ""When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy.""', 'It might be too early to call the rally in AI stocks a bubble, but the most obvious plays are often the best ones in these situations, much like stay-at-home stocks such as Zoom Video Communications and Peloton were big winners in the early stages of the pandemic.', ""By that same logic, Nvidia still looks like a good choice in the AI revolution. The stock's gains over the past year aren't built on air. Its profit has soared because its technology is in high demand, and its processors are well ahead of the competition. While some expect that gap to close, there are also signs competitive dynamics could move in the opposite direction as Nvidia presses its competitive advantage. For instance, it unveiled new AI PC chips in January, threatening to take market share in a category that Intel\xa0has long led."", ""Nvidia also seems well priced, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 33 based on this year's earnings estimates. If the company can exceed that target, the stock will surely move higher."", ""Microsoft looks like another easy AI stock to own. While the company doesn't have the same direct exposure to AI demand that Nvidia does, it seems to be the company that's best positioned to benefit from AI in a diverse set of ways. Its partnership with OpenAI has already paid off significantly as its AI-based Copilot is in programs such as Azure, Office 365, Bing, and GitHub. The company said on its recent earnings call that AI was responsible for six additional percentage points of growth, helping it outpace its competition, and it now has 53,000 Azure AI customers."", ""Microsoft's early lead also ensures that its highly profitable core product will remain relevant and in demand, helping to block out potential competition."", ""Finally, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is the third AI stock worth buying for a new tech boom. Like Nvidia, Supermicro has found itself in the envious position of making hardware that helps run AI-based models like those that ChatGPT uses. Supermicro makes server and storage equipment that's in high demand in the AI revolution, driving revenue up 103% in its most recent quarter, and the company is currently supply constrained since it relies on Nvidia chips, meaning that growth could be even stronger."", 'Like Nvidia, Supermicro is also profitable and trades at a reasonable forward P/E of just 31. Those estimates could easily move higher if supply improves.', 'If Ives is right and this is 1995, then there should be plenty of winners in the AI boom. Investors are best off focusing on stocks that are solidly profitable and already clearly benefiting from AI.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Grand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will soar 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030. That implies an annual growth of 37% over that time frame.', 'Investors can capitalize on that opportunity by purchasing individual AI stocks. But that strategy requires quite a bit of work. Before buying a stock, investors should thoroughly research the underlying business. Additionally, investors must keep tabs on all the companies they own over time to ensure their investment theses remain sensible.', ""Alternatively, investors can buy AI index funds. It's a strategy that requires much less work. Index funds are ready-made portfolios that spread capital across many different companies. While it simplifies the work, investors must still investigate any index funds they want to own to ensure their capital is spread across the right companies at a reasonable price."", 'To help in that research, here is one AI index fund worth buying, and three AI index funds to avoid.', 'When investors think about artificial intelligence (AI), I doubt an S&P 500 index fund is the first thing that comes to mind. However, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is an excellent way to capitalize on the growing demand for AI because it has a more favorable risk-reward profile than most index funds.', 'How does the S&P 500 relate to AI? A total of 152 S&P 500 companies discussed AI during third-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet. Not all of them will use AI in a way that creates value for shareholders, but some will undoubtedly monetize the technology to great effect.', 'Consider the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the percentage share of the overall fund:', 'Apple: 7%', 'Microsoft: 7%', 'Alphabet: 3.8%', 'Amazon: 3.4%', 'Nvidia: 3%', 'Of those five companies, four are very well-positioned to monetize AI. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are the largest cloud services providers in the world. That means all three should benefit as businesses provision cloud infrastructure to develop AI applications. Moreover, all three have introduced generative AI assistants that extend their ability to monetize AI.', ""Similarly, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in machine learning. The company has also expanded its ability to monetize AI by branching into data center networking equipment, central processing units (CPUs), subscription software, and cloud services -- all purpose-built for AI."", 'Another reason the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a compelling investment is that very few index funds beat the benchmark over time. In fact, just 20% of large-cap funds outperformed the S&P 500 over the last three years, and just 13% outperformed over the last five years, according to S&P Global.', 'Finally, the S&P 500 has been a surefire moneymaker for patient investors. The index has produced a positive return over every rolling 20-year period in history, and it has never failed to recover from any correction, bear market, or recession. Moreover, the S&P 500 returned 241% over the last decade, compounding at 13% annually. At that pace, $100 invested weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would have grown into more than $100,000.', 'When selecting an index fund, investors should ask themselves two questions. First, has the index fund in question consistently outperformed the S&P 500? If the answer is no, think twice about buying it. Settling for underperformance is nonsensical in most cases.', 'Second, is the index fund in question expensive? The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF bears an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.03%, meaning investors would pay just $3 per year in fees on a $10,000 portfolio. It would be silly to pay much more unless the index fund has handily outperformed the S&P 500 in the past.', 'With that in mind, investors should avoid the following index funds.', 'The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ: BOTZ) measures the performance of 42 stocks. Its two largest holdings, Nvidia and Intuitive Surgical, account for 20% of its weight. The index fund underperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, three, and five years. It also bears an above-average expense ratio of 0.69%.', 'The Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKQ) measures the performance of 36 stocks. Its two largest holdings, Tesla and UiPath, account for 20% of its weight. The index fund underperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, three, and five years. It also bears an above-average expense ratio of 0.75%.', 'The iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEMKT: IRBO) measures the performance of 111 stocks. Its two largest holdings, Nvidia and Meta Platforms, account for just 3% of its weight. However, the index fund still underperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, three, and five years. It also bears an above-average expense ratio of 0.47%.', 'Investors need not choose to hold just index funds or individual stocks. A blended strategy is perfectly acceptable. In other words, investors could split their money between an S&P 500 index fund and a select group of AI stocks. That strategy is attractive because it leaves room for outperformance but it also limits downside.', ""Specifically, an investor would beat the S&P 500 if their individual stocks outperformed. But their portfolios wouldn't fare too badly even if their stocks underperformed, provided they allocated enough money to an S&P 500 index fund. Remember, the S&P 500 returned 13% annually over the past decade. It also returned 10% annually over the past three decades."", 'Personally, I prefer the blended approach. Buying individual stocks lets me take a little extra risk, but I balance that risk with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

The growth we delivered in affiliate fee revenues was the standout this quarter, with the Television segment growing by 10% and the Cable segment returning to growth, once again demonstrating the power of our brands and our programming. We now largely completed our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewal cycle, having achieved our commercial goals without disruption and setting a solid foundation for renewals in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter were down, primarily due to comparisons to last year's major cyclical events, including the mid-term elections at the TV stations and the broadcast of the Men's World Cup in the Cable and Television segments."", 'Parsing through the cyclical comparisons, our concentration in News and Sports coupled with the outstanding performance at Tubi is clearly an advantage in a mixed advertising environment.

At News, the second quarter was more nuanced, while preemptions and the direct response market adversely impacted quarterly growth, we sequentially narrowed the gap between the current and prior year in ratings and in pricing. We were also able to increase our viewing share over the previous quarter, and the positive trends in share ratings and pricing have carried over into the current quarter.', 'See also 15 Best Inexpensive Tequilas Under $40 that Don’t Taste Bad and 15 Best Rums Under $40.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.61 per share on the 1st of April. This means that the annual payment will be 3.3% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry.', ' Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', 'We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before this announcement, C.H. Robinson Worldwide was paying out 89% of earnings, but a comparatively small 44% of free cash flows. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 90.0% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 48% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.40 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.44. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.7% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.', ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. C.H. Robinson Worldwide's EPS has fallen by approximately 10% per year during the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We don't think C.H. Robinson Worldwide is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for C.H. Robinson Worldwide that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our collection of strong dividend payers."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The company\'s results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were mixed relative to analyst expectations, but a surge in profit was enough to convince investors to push up the stock on Thursday.', ""Disney's adjusted earnings per share shot up 23% year over year to $1.22, and the company believes EPS will grow by at least 20% in fiscal 2024. What's more, Disney sees free cash flow coming in at roughly $8 billion for the year, up from just $4.9 billion in fiscal 2023."", 'This improved cash generation will enable Disney to ramp up its dividend and restart share buybacks. Disney announced that it was boosting its quarterly dividend payment by 50% to $0.45 per share, and the company plans to spend about $3 billion in fiscal 2024 on share buybacks. The new dividend plus the share buybacks add up to more than $6 billion of capital returns to shareholders over the next year.', ""This surge in profit and free cash flow is mostly being driven by Disney's aggressive cost-cutting initiatives. Revenue was flat in the first quarter, with growth in experiences and sports offsetting a decline in the entertainment segment. The company managed to shave off $500 million in operating costs as part of its plan to find $7.5 billion in annualized savings by the end of this fiscal year. Disney said that it's on track to meet or exceed that target."", ""One of the pillars of Disney's turnaround strategy is to turn its streaming business into a profitable enterprise. Before Iger returned as CEO in late 2022, the focus was on winning subscribers despite heavy losses. Disney is now focused on the bottom line."", ""Price hikes led to subscriber losses for the Disney+ service in the first quarter, but higher prices combined with reduced costs brought the streaming business to the cusp of profitability. Disney's collection of streaming businesses, which span the entertainment and sports segments, reported an operation loss of $216 million in the first quarter. That's a vast improvement from a loss of over $1 billion in the prior-year period."", 'Growing the dividend further will require the streaming business to become a source of free cash flow. Disney expects streaming to reach profitability in the fourth quarter, and in the long run, the company anticipates streaming becoming a ""key earnings growth driver.""', ""Disney's free cash flow generation this year will be more than enough to cover the higher dividend and share buybacks. Beyond boosting profits at the streaming business, driving free cash flow higher in the years ahead will require the company to reinvigorate its films business."", 'Disney\'s film studios fall under the ""Content Sales/Licensing and Other"" portion of the entertainment segment. Revenue was down 38% year over year in the first quarter to $1.6 billion, and operating loss swelled to $224 million. While Marvel movies were once a sure thing for the company, recent releases have underwhelmed. The Marvels, for example, was a complete flop, generating just over $200 million worldwide at the box office.', 'The company has big plans for 2024, 2025 and 2026, including a new Frozen film, a new Toy Story film, a Zootopia sequel, a sequel to Moana, Avatar 3, a new Star Wars movie, and a variety of Marvel films. Notably, the Moana sequel was originally developed as a series, but the company decided to convert it to a feature-length film and release it this year. Leaning on sequels in popular franchises will help the cause, but the company still needs to figure out a way to reengage audiences who have cooled on the Marvel cinematic universe.', ""Shares of Disney are down nearly 50% from their pandemic-era high. The new dividend and the share buybacks should make the stock more enticing to investors, although it will likely take profits catching up to the valuation for the stock to fully recover. Disney stock trades for more than 20 times the company's free cash flow guidance."", 'Free cash flow has the potential to soar in the coming years as Disney transforms its streaming business into a source of profits. Two new sports streaming initiatives, a joint venture with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery slated for launch later this year and a solo ESPN streaming service set for 2025, could be big hits as viewers clamor for easy streaming access to their favorite teams.', ""Disney stock may look pricey, but the company has enormous growth potential. Disney's slate of characters, franchises, and intellectual properties is unrivaled in the media business. The task at hand is figuring out how to make it all work together in the age of streaming. While there's still work to do, Disney is making serious progress."", 'For investors willing to buy and hold for at least a few years, Disney looks like a fantastic turnaround stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

Now the business may have just been dealt a knockout punch. Its single most important draw -- live sports broadcasts -- will soon no longer be predominantly tied to cable service providers.', 'Once an anchor for the cable business, more and more sports programming has been making its way to streaming venues. A massive chunk of this programming is going to suddenly be made available online later this year. Cable company investors should be very concerned.', ""Sports isn't exactly unheard of on streaming platforms. Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS) ESPN+ offers a great deal of what its ESPN cable channel doesn't. Amazon's Prime aired the NFL's Thursday night games this past season. Paramount Global's Paramount+ and Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Peacock gave their subscribers access to a bunch of NFL games this year as well. Notably, Paramount+ will air this year's NFL championship game on the streaming platform."", ""But there's a major leap forward on the sports-streaming front coming later this year."", 'On Tuesday, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD), and Fox (NASDAQ: FOX) (NASDAQ: FOXA) co-announced the trio is teaming up to launch a streaming service later this year that will carry a tremendous number of live sporting events. While several details -- like pricing -- have yet to be hammered out, other details have already been divulged. Chief among them is the fact that subscribers to this platform will ""have access to the linear sports networks including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNews, ABC, Fox, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS, truTV, as well as ESPN+."" That\'s pretty much everything these three media giants offer on the sports front.', ""Perhaps most noteworthy, however, is the fact that while this lineup of cable channels will certainly appeal to sports fans, broadcast networks like ABC and Fox, along with cable channels like TNT and TBS, aren't sports-only venues. This bundle is a big slice of the rest of cable's most important programming. It's missing Comcast's NBC and Paramount's CBS. But it's also missing a bunch of the cable channels that cable critics claim most people rarely watch and don't want to pay for."", 'More to the point, this sports-friendly skinny bundle may well be enough to turn any marginally committed cable subscribers into full-blown cord-cutters.', ""Is this new deal a guaranteed immediate end to the country's cable TV names like Charter Communications' and Comcast's Xfinity? No. There's a sizable cohort of cable customers who will pay for traditional cable service until the day they die. It's just too easy, convenient, and familiar for them to quit now."", 'The partnership\'s participants also understand they\'ve got a vested interest in minimizing the adverse impact it may have on the country\'s cable television industry. As Gabelli Funds\' co-CIO for Value Chris Marangi noted in an interview with Fool.com: ""Presumably, the product will be priced so as not to encourage cord-cutting. In fact, it appears aimed at capturing those not currently in a bundle (cord-nevers).""', ""It's a premise that's sure to be tested. Cable TV providers seem to only have a tenuous hold on their current customer basis. Charter lost another 257,000 cable subscribers during the final quarter of last year, dragging its headcount down from an early 2018 figure of nearly 16.8 million to a little over 14.1 million now. Comcast's Spectrum is clearly on the defensive as well. It was serving almost 22.3 million paying cable customers as of the first quarter of 2018. Thanks to last quarter's attrition of another 389,000 cable subs, it now only has 14.1 million remaining."", ""It's not as if Comcast and Charter are outliers either. Altice, Dish Network, and other cable companies are already facing the same degree of customer losses. And these losses may well accelerate once Disney's, Fox's, and Warner's sports-generous skinny bundle is launched this fall."", 'Numbers from CableTV.com suggest access to live sports is the top reason consumers continue paying for cable, with 19.6% of U.S. cable customers polled making that claim. The next-nearest reason at 11.7% of respondents is keeping access to live entertainment. Being able to watch news is the most important feature for 9.5% of respondents, with a slightly higher 10.1% of these consumers saying their internet service is too slow to support streaming video.', ""With much of cable's sports programming -- along with a wide swath of its non-sports content -- about to become available outside of a conventional cable subscription, at least three of those reasons for not cutting the cord weaken ... a lot."", 'Walt Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox are the winners here. Just be sure to keep any expectations in check.', ""The challenge isn't a lack of capability or lack of content to share with subscribers. The issue is that in all three cases, a successful streaming partnership at least partially threatens each party's existing cable-based revenue. And in Disney's case, any additional success on the sports streaming front will be diluted by the media giant's much bigger television, film, and theme park businesses. This new venture may or may not move the needle much."", ""Take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. The nation's cable television business is disintegrating with or without any additional prodding from streaming players and studios. All three companies in question are better served by taking matters into their own hands now rather than allowing themselves to be put in a position where they can't call their own shots."", 'Indeed, this team-up may well reverse the slow, collective decline of all three companies\' current television businesses. As Gabelli Funds\' Marangi went on to say: ""We\'ve talked about the importance of scale in this business. ... I think this gives those companies a path forward to be an effective competitor and to save money in doing it.""', ""It's possible all three members of this trio will be better off by starting a full-blown (even if gradual) break-up with its cable television partners. They certainly don't bring as much value to the table anymore, and will likely only bring less in the future."", ""The overarching challenge here isn't changing. That's the difficulty in determining causes and effects within the television entertainment industry."", ""See, people are already cutting the cord, so it won't be entirely clear if any acceleration of the cord-cutting movement is the result of a new skinny bundle or not. Fox's, Disney's, and Warner's new joint streaming service is slated to launch later this year, but consumers may or may not cancel their cable service and sign up for the alternative straightaway. It might take months or even years to prompt people to change their minds about how they watch TV."", 'As an investor, however, part of your job -- and maybe the biggest part -- is ferreting out the bigger, broader trends that are working for or against a particular stock you may own. In this case, the advent of a sweeping sports-fan-friendly streaming bundle makes a big problem even worse for cable companies like Charter and Comcast.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

This surge was fueled by a resurgence in the technology sector and optimism surrounding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which bodes well for corporate earnings outlooks. Notably, the latest revision in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) underscored progress in taming inflation towards the end of 2023, providing additional impetus to the bullish sentiment. However, amidst the euphoria, concerns have been raised by strategists like BofA's Hartnett, who warned that stocks are nearing a threshold that could trigger a sell-off, urging caution among investors. Interestingly, amidst the fervor in equity markets, there has been a notable appetite for fixed-income assets, as highlighted by Allspring's Pacquement. This underscores a nuanced approach among investors, who are seemingly diversifying their portfolios amid the ongoing market rally. The sustained upward trajectory in stock prices, particularly in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, underscores the resilience and dominance of the technology sector in driving market gains. This relentless climb in stock prices reflects investor confidence in the prospects of major tech companies and their ability to deliver robust financial performance in the coming quarters."", ""As the S&P 500 index crosses the historic threshold of 5,000 for the first time, investors are grappling with the decision of whether to jump into the market or remain on the sidelines. While financial advisers caution against placing undue importance on milestone moments like these, they also emphasize the importance of considering individual circumstances before making investment decisions. In light of this record-breaking milestone, it's crucial for investors to contextualize the significance of this event and carefully assess its implications. Market strategists and wealth advisers recommend a thoughtful approach to framing the decision-making process. Rather than reacting impulsively to the headline-grabbing news, investors are encouraged to evaluate their own financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline to determine the most prudent course of action. Ultimately, the decision to invest or wait should be guided by a thorough understanding of one's own financial situation and objectives. While milestone moments in the market can capture attention, it's essential to maintain a disciplined approach to investing and avoid making decisions based solely on short-term market movements. By taking a comprehensive and strategic approach, investors can navigate market fluctuations with confidence and make informed choices that align with their long-term financial goals."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bearish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Snap Inc.

Investors' reaction to the news was notably positive, reflecting a sense of resilience and confidence in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) future performance despite the revised target.

Now the business may have just been dealt a knockout punch. Its single most important draw -- live sports broadcasts -- will soon no longer be predominantly tied to cable service providers.', 'Once an anchor for the cable business, more and more sports programming has been making its way to streaming venues. A massive chunk of this programming is going to suddenly be made available online later this year. Cable company investors should be very concerned.', ""Sports isn't exactly unheard of on streaming platforms. Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS) ESPN+ offers a great deal of what its ESPN cable channel doesn't. Amazon's Prime aired the NFL's Thursday night games this past season. Paramount Global's Paramount+ and Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Peacock gave their subscribers access to a bunch of NFL games this year as well. Notably, Paramount+ will air this year's NFL championship game on the streaming platform."", ""But there's a major leap forward on the sports-streaming front coming later this year."", 'On Tuesday, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD), and Fox (NASDAQ: FOX) (NASDAQ: FOXA) co-announced the trio is teaming up to launch a streaming service later this year that will carry a tremendous number of live sporting events. While several details -- like pricing -- have yet to be hammered out, other details have already been divulged. Chief among them is the fact that subscribers to this platform will ""have access to the linear sports networks including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNews, ABC, Fox, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS, truTV, as well as ESPN+."" That\'s pretty much everything these three media giants offer on the sports front.', ""Perhaps most noteworthy, however, is the fact that while this lineup of cable channels will certainly appeal to sports fans, broadcast networks like ABC and Fox, along with cable channels like TNT and TBS, aren't sports-only venues. This bundle is a big slice of the rest of cable's most important programming. It's missing Comcast's NBC and Paramount's CBS. But it's also missing a bunch of the cable channels that cable critics claim most people rarely watch and don't want to pay for."", 'More to the point, this sports-friendly skinny bundle may well be enough to turn any marginally committed cable subscribers into full-blown cord-cutters.', ""Is this new deal a guaranteed immediate end to the country's cable TV names like Charter Communications' and Comcast's Xfinity? No. There's a sizable cohort of cable customers who will pay for traditional cable service until the day they die. It's just too easy, convenient, and familiar for them to quit now."", 'The partnership\'s participants also understand they\'ve got a vested interest in minimizing the adverse impact it may have on the country\'s cable television industry. As Gabelli Funds\' co-CIO for Value Chris Marangi noted in an interview with Fool.com: ""Presumably, the product will be priced so as not to encourage cord-cutting. In fact, it appears aimed at capturing those not currently in a bundle (cord-nevers).""', ""It's a premise that's sure to be tested. Cable TV providers seem to only have a tenuous hold on their current customer basis. Charter lost another 257,000 cable subscribers during the final quarter of last year, dragging its headcount down from an early 2018 figure of nearly 16.8 million to a little over 14.1 million now. Comcast's Spectrum is clearly on the defensive as well. It was serving almost 22.3 million paying cable customers as of the first quarter of 2018. Thanks to last quarter's attrition of another 389,000 cable subs, it now only has 14.1 million remaining."", ""It's not as if Comcast and Charter are outliers either. Altice, Dish Network, and other cable companies are already facing the same degree of customer losses. And these losses may well accelerate once Disney's, Fox's, and Warner's sports-generous skinny bundle is launched this fall."", 'Numbers from CableTV.com suggest access to live sports is the top reason consumers continue paying for cable, with 19.6% of U.S. cable customers polled making that claim. The next-nearest reason at 11.7% of respondents is keeping access to live entertainment. Being able to watch news is the most important feature for 9.5% of respondents, with a slightly higher 10.1% of these consumers saying their internet service is too slow to support streaming video.', ""With much of cable's sports programming -- along with a wide swath of its non-sports content -- about to become available outside of a conventional cable subscription, at least three of those reasons for not cutting the cord weaken ... a lot."", 'Walt Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox are the winners here. Just be sure to keep any expectations in check.', ""The challenge isn't a lack of capability or lack of content to share with subscribers. The issue is that in all three cases, a successful streaming partnership at least partially threatens each party's existing cable-based revenue. And in Disney's case, any additional success on the sports streaming front will be diluted by the media giant's much bigger television, film, and theme park businesses. This new venture may or may not move the needle much."", ""Take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. The nation's cable television business is disintegrating with or without any additional prodding from streaming players and studios. All three companies in question are better served by taking matters into their own hands now rather than allowing themselves to be put in a position where they can't call their own shots."", 'Indeed, this team-up may well reverse the slow, collective decline of all three companies\' current television businesses. As Gabelli Funds\' Marangi went on to say: ""We\'ve talked about the importance of scale in this business. ... I think this gives those companies a path forward to be an effective competitor and to save money in doing it.""', ""It's possible all three members of this trio will be better off by starting a full-blown (even if gradual) break-up with its cable television partners. They certainly don't bring as much value to the table anymore, and will likely only bring less in the future."", ""The overarching challenge here isn't changing. That's the difficulty in determining causes and effects within the television entertainment industry."", ""See, people are already cutting the cord, so it won't be entirely clear if any acceleration of the cord-cutting movement is the result of a new skinny bundle or not. Fox's, Disney's, and Warner's new joint streaming service is slated to launch later this year, but consumers may or may not cancel their cable service and sign up for the alternative straightaway. It might take months or even years to prompt people to change their minds about how they watch TV."", 'As an investor, however, part of your job -- and maybe the biggest part -- is ferreting out the bigger, broader trends that are working for or against a particular stock you may own.

Some of the opportunities are rather unique. From ultra-high-yields to variable payments to income streams backed by sustainability, the energy sector provides many different ways for investors to generate income. ', ""Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their uniqueness. Here's why they think dividend investors should take a closer look at these interesting energy stocks. "", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Devon Energy): Before going any further, it's important to highlight that U.S. oil and natural gas producer Devon Energy is a terrible choice for investors who want consistent dividends. That's a simple statement to make because the board of directors has adopted a variable dividend policy that's tied to the company's financial performance. And given the highly volatile nature of the energy sector, it shouldn't be too shocking to know that Devon's dividends can be pretty volatile, too. So, if dividend consistency is important to you, you should skip on by this company."", ""But that doesn't mean that Devon Energy is bad for all investors. In fact, if you step back and think about Devon's dividend a little, it might actually be a unique opportunity to hedge your real-world energy costs. For example, when oil and natural gas are expensive, you will have to pay more to fill your gas tank and heat your home. But at the very same time, those high energy prices are likely to be boosting Devon Energy's earnings, too. That, with a little lag, will probably result in a higher dividend payment. The extra income you collect from the dividend can help offset the strain on your budget from higher energy costs."", ""Perhaps that dividend dynamic doesn't make sense as a core energy holding, but it certainly could add value to a more diversified income portfolio as a hedge against energy price inflation. The caveat is that you have to be prepared for the inevitable dividend cuts that will come when energy prices decline. Also, the dividend yield, which is roughly 6.7% today, isn't a particularly good gauge of the income the stock will generate over time."", 'Matt DiLallo (ConocoPhillips): Many energy companies have unveiled unique ways to return additional cash to investors in recent years. They wanted to maintain flexibility to adjust to market conditions while still being able to reward investors.', 'ConocoPhillips initiated its three-tier return of capital program in late 2021. That program features a fixed base quarterly dividend the company aims to increase each year, a quarterly variable return of cash (VROC) payment, and share repurchases. The company wanted to offer investors a reliable cash return (the base dividend) while remaining flexible to return additional cash to shareholders based on its free cash flow and business needs. ', 'The oil company typically sets a capital return target early each year and adjusts it based on commodity prices. For example, its initial target for 2022 was to return $7 billion. However, it ultimately returned $15 billion because of strong oil prices. Meanwhile, the company set a goal to return $11 billion last year, which it achieved. ', 'For 2024, ConocoPhillips plans to return $9 billion to shareholders. The base return will come from its quarterly dividend of $0.58 per share, which it increased by 14% in November. On top of that, the company plans to make a $0.20 per share VROC payment in the first quarter. That VROC payment, as the name implies, could vary in future quarters. It has been as high as $1.40 per share and as low as $0.20 per share since the company initiated the additional payment in 2021. ConocoPhillips also plans to repurchase shares (it bought back $5.4 billion of stock in 2023 while paying $5.6 billion via dividends and VROC). ', ""ConocoPhillips provides investors with a solid income floor from its fixed quarterly dividend and income upside potential from its VROC. While the variability of that secondary payment isn't for everyone, it enables investors to collect some extra cash when crude prices are higher."", ""Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): Brookfield Renewable is an attractive dividend stock from the energy patch right now for three reasons. First, it's a bet on renewable energy, the demand for which should only rise in the coming decades as more countries push to reduce carbon emissions. Second, Brookfield Renewable grows its dividend regularly, which has, so far, meant fatter dividend checks for income investors every year. Third and most importantly, Brookfield Renewable sees ample growth opportunities ahead to power its dividends."", ""Although Brookfield Renewable's shares have fallen steadily over the past year or so, the company generated record funds from operations (FFO) per unit in 2023 despite facing challenges like high interest rates. It added nearly 5 gigawatts (GW) of capacity last year, and its total development pipeline of more than 130 GW as of the end of 2023 was up nearly 80% from the previous year."", ""That development pipeline, when topped with acquisitions, should be able to drive Brookfield Renewable's FFO and dividend per unit even higher in the coming years. The company has a strong record so far, having grown its FFO and dividend per share by compound annual growth rates of 10% and 6%, respectively, between 2012 and 2023."", 'Brookfield Renewable now expects to deploy nearly $7 billion to $8 billion over the next five years, which should set the ball rolling for a targeted annual FFO per unit growth of 10% pace through 2028.

Whether Chipotle intends to build a comparable worldwide footprint is not clear, but the success of McDonald's indicates it can keep adding stores for a long time to come."", 'Furthermore, Chipotle made a fortuitous decision when it invested in its digital sales platform and began adding Chipotlanes in 2019.

Even though customers can dine in again, over 36% of its sales are from its digital platform, indicating it has succeeded in making the ordering process more efficient.', 'When it comes to overall sales, it reported $9.9 billion in revenue in 2023, a yearly increase of 14%. That includes an 8% surge in comparable restaurant sales, with the rest of the increase coming from its added locations.', 'Chipotle has also capitalized on its pricing power. It has long served as a low-cost option for natural food. So far, periodic price increases amid rising labor and food costs have not deterred customers. That power may have helped its operating margin climb to 16%, up from 13% in the previous year. That resulted in a net income of $1.2 billion in 2023, a 37% increase year over year.', ""Given these results, it may not surprise investors that the stock is up almost 60% over the last year. And while its price-to-earnings ratio of 64 is well above the McDonald's earnings multiple of 25, its valuation is well below five-year averages, making further multiple expansion more likely."", 'Despite massive long-term growth and high earnings multiples, the growth in Chipotle stock is unlikely to end anytime soon. Amid a rapid U.S. expansion, it has only completed about half its expected North American buildout. Moreover, rising prices have not deterred revenue and profit growth.', ""Furthermore, it has begun expanding into Europe, and if it can benefit from success similar to McDonald's, it could build a massive international presence over the next few decades.

(NYSE:UPS) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-checks-buying-united-parcel-120623970.html,1707653183,STORY,['UPS'],"[""Readers hoping to buy United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase United Parcel Service's shares on or after the 16th of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 8th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.63 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$6.52 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, United Parcel Service stock has a trailing yield of around 4.5% on the current share price of US$146.26. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Its dividend payout ratio is 83% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether United Parcel Service generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The company paid out 106% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here."", ""While United Parcel Service's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to United Parcel Service's ability to maintain its dividend."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see United Parcel Service earnings per share are up 7.3% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. United Parcel Service has delivered an average of 10% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Should investors buy United Parcel Service for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have grown somewhat, although United Parcel Service paid out over half its profits and the dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor."", ""With that being said, if you're still considering United Parcel Service as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with United Parcel Service and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

(NYSE:ZBH) filed its yearly result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 2.8% to US$123 in the past week. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$7.4b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Zimmer Biomet Holdings surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$4.88 per share, a notable 14% above expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Zimmer Biomet Holdings after the latest results."", ' View our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Zimmer Biomet Holdings from 26 analysts is for revenues of US$7.74b in 2024. If met, it would imply a satisfactory 4.7% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to rise 7.4% to US$5.26. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$7.70b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.32 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$136. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Zimmer Biomet Holdings at US$175 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$109. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. One thing stands out from these estimates, which is that Zimmer Biomet Holdings is forecast to grow faster in the future than it has in the past, with revenues expected to display 4.7% annualised growth until the end of 2024. If achieved, this would be a much better result than the 2.3% annual decline over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 7.9% per year. Although Zimmer Biomet Holdings' revenues are expected to improve, it seems that the analysts are still bearish on the business, forecasting it to grow slower than the broader industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Zimmer Biomet Holdings' revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Zimmer Biomet Holdings analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Zimmer Biomet Holdings that we have uncovered.', 'Have feedback on this article?

However, his often-cited favorite holding period of forever didn't apply in this case.

The COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns caused the global economy to spiral downward. Demand for oil and gas dwindled with few people traveling."", ""In the first quarter of 2022, though, Buffett again placed a big bet on Occidental and bought close to 130 million shares for Berkshire's portfolio. He kept on buying the stock throughout much of the rest of the year."", ""The aggressive buying continued in 2023. And Buffett is still at it this year. Earlier this month, Berkshire added another 4.3 million Oxy shares.

In August 2022, Berkshire received regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of Occidental. Its stake currently stands at 28.3%. If Buffett keeps buying (and I expect that he will), it could push the stock higher.', ""I agree with Buffett's positive view about Hollub.

There are multiple factors driving the continued adoption of telehealth solutions, including growing awareness and adoption of these technologies, the economically favorable solutions that telehealth can offer compared to in-person appointments, growing payer coverage, an aging population, and a still persistent shortage of healthcare workers.', ""It's safe to say there's room for multiple players in this space, but Teladoc is still one of the largest telehealth providers in the world. The company has had a rough few years, and many investors jumped ship after it reported a series of multibillion-dollar impairment charges to write down the value of pandemic-era acquisitions."", ""However, it's important to point out that most of Teladoc's impairment charges were paper-only losses, not operational ones. And those net losses have shrunk substantially quarter by quarter. Teladoc shrank its net loss to $0.35 per share or $57 million by the third quarter of 2023, compared to $0.45 or $74 million in the prior-year period."", ""Meanwhile, third-quarter revenue was up 8% year over year to $660 million, driven by 9% revenue growth in Teladoc's Integrated Care segment and 8% revenue growth in its BetterHelp segment. Looking back over the trailing 12 months, Teladoc has raked in $2.6 billion in revenue and operating cash flow in the amount of $285 million."", ""It's not been an easy time to be a Teladoc investor these last few years, as I can attest to personally. But I still believe in the growth trajectory of this business. Shares are trading at a price-to-sales ratio of a mere 1.2.

One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.32 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings.

Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 22%) over the same period."", ""On the whole, we feel that General Electric's performance has been quite good.

The homebuilding sector continues to show promising signs, and discerning investors are eyeing the potential to generate outsized returns.', 'During the pandemic, investors saw a balloon in home prices across the country. This was primarily driven by fiscal stimulus and ultra low interest rates. However, easy money fed policies would ultimately spike inflation, later fostering the tightening of financial conditions.', 'Despite a drastic shift in macroeconomic policies and a general slowdown in home buying, home prices have still remained relatively elevated. Due to the supply/demand imbalance, the United States is facing a shortage in available homes to the tune of 3.2 million. With an urgent need to build more homes, these three companies are looking to capitalize on the U.S. housing shortage.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Now, let’s discover the three best home builder stocks to buy for 2024!', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is certainly one of the best home builder stocks to buy for 2024. They remain the largest homebuilder in the U.S. by volume, and the outlook for this year looks very strong.', 'Over the last year, investors have become skeptical about the housing market amid inflation and higher mortgage rates. Demand has certainly softened from the pandemic peak, but the supply of new and existing homes remains limited. This is good news for D.R. Horton, as net sales surged 35% YOY in their latest quarterly results.', 'In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 6% YOY to $7.7 billion. Net income was $947 million, or $2.42 per share. When looking at the results at face value, there was nothing spectacular that was reported. However, the underlying business fundamentals and outlook on the housing market tell a different story. Net sales for new homes increased 35% YOY, with homes closed increasing 12% respectively. The company’s liquidity is strong, and net new homes closed could increase rapidly with lower mortgage rates in the back half of 2024.', 'Source: madamF via Shutterstock', 'Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) is an American home construction company headquartered in Miami, Fla. They’re currently the second largest home building company in the U.S.', 'It is without a doubt that homebuilding stocks will continue to outperform the market for the foreseeable future. Over the last five years, Lennar Corp has far outpaced the S&P 500. That is set to continue, as the U.S. is currently in the midst of a housing shortage. Furthermore, Lennar Corp is currently capitalizing on this trend as net new orders increased 13% to 69,111 homes in the 2023 fiscal year.', 'In Q4 2023, revenue increased 8% YOY to $11 billion. EPS increased 6% to $4.62 per share. Home buyers continued to respond favorably to incentives, as trends remained positive despite higher mortgage rates. During the quarter deliveries increased 19% to 23,795, with a current backlog of 14,892 homes. Demand continues to outway supply, and investors can expect robust operational efficiency in FY24.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is last but not least one of the top considerations for the best home builder stocks to buy for 2024. The company has built more than 750,000 homes since its inception, and is the third largest home builder in the U.S.', 'The current macroeconomic climate has negatively affected the entire construction industry as a whole. However, home buying activity has remained strong due to the current supply/demand imbalance. PulteGroup growth was flat for 2023, but management is bullish on the 2024 outlook given a strong job market and lower interest rates.', 'In Q4 2023, net new orders for homes increased an astonishing 57% to 6,212 homes. Home sale gross margins were 28.9%, with a unit backlog of 7,615 homes reflecting a value of $7.6 billion. With lower interest rates on the table in 2024, limited inventory is a positive growth tailwind for PulteGroup. With a $1.5 billion increase to share repurchase authorization, their strong liquidity instills confidence in shareholders moving forward. This makes PulteGroup one of the best home builder stocks to buy for 2024.

If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.', ""The spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace."", ""For instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance."", 'Additionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.', ""Even if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry."", 'At the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors.

There are billions of smartphones and connected devices, and companies increasingly work remotely and rely on cloud services. With this rise in technology has also come an increase in cyberattacks. ', ""According to IBM's 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report, 51% of organizations were planning to increase investments in security as a result of a breach. The average cost of a data breach globally was over $4.45 million, up 15% from three years ago. And that's just one type of cyberattack."", 'As attacks become more frequent (and expensive), the need for cybersecurity solutions has amplified, putting the industry in indispensable territory. For investors wanting to go along for the ride, here are three top cybersecurity stocks to buy in February.', 'If you were anywhere near the tech world in the past year, you know how unavoidable artificial intelligence (AI) has been. It has gone mainstream recently, but AI has been around for a while. One of the companies that helped usher in AI in its industry is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Since 2011, it has been using AI to power its cybersecurity solutions.', ""CrowdStrike isn't just a recipient of AI hype; its business results show the company is one of the premier cybersecurity stocks in the industry. It offers different modules that address a broad range of cybersecurity needs, and 63% of its subscription customers use at least five modules. Around 26% use seven or more."", 'Growing subscriptions and a comprehensive ecosystem helped CrowdStrike achieve $3.2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in its 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 31), up 35% year over year (YOY). Its operating income surged 81% YOY to $356 million, showing increased profitability, and the margins on that income were also up 9% from two years prior.', ""CrowdStrike stock isn't necessarily cheap, but it should be an excellent long-term investment for those who can stomach the volatility likely to come with it."", ""Founded in 2005, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) is one of the older pure cybersecurity companies. It's also one of the largest, with a market cap of over $100 billion (as of Feb. 5), thanks to a 120% stock price jump over the past 12 months."", ""Many cybersecurity companies offer various products, but Palo Alto Networks prides itself on essentially being a one-stop shop. Whether it's firewalls, advanced threat protection, or cloud security, the company offers a comprehensive suite of tools."", ""In the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, it made $1.88 billion in revenue, up 20% year over year. Investors shouldn't expect the same growth as you would from younger cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike, but there's something to be said about Palo Alto's improving profitability. "", 'In its latest quarter, it had operating income of $529 million with 28% margins. In the same period last year, those numbers were $322 million and 21%, respectively.', 'Palo Alto Networks has a customer base of large clients that need thorough solutions, and the company has been effective at providing them. If you want a company that operates on the full spectrum of cybersecurity, this is your go-to.', ""Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a cybersecurity company with a slightly different approach than the other two on this list. While CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are focused on cybersecurity software, Cisco's bread and butter has long been its hardware."", ""Although hardware is what largely made Cisco the $200 billion company it is today, it has been taking steps to compete more directly with cybersecurity software. Its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk (expected to close later this year) is one of the clearest signs of the company's strategic shift toward enhancing its software choices. The deal should boost its security portfolio."", ""Becoming more service-focused should benefit Cisco because it provides more recurring revenue than hardware sales. It won't be (and hasn't been) the quickest transition, but there are signs of progress despite some economic headwinds in the past couple of years."", ""In the meantime, Cisco's dividend should help buy it some patience from investors. The quarterly dividend is $0.39, with a yield of around 3.1%. That's well over double the S&P 500's recent average."", "" More importantly, investors don't have to question the dividend's stability. It has increased every year since Cisco began paying one in 2011."", 'Cisco can be a chance for investors to get exposure to the cybersecurity industry and simultaneously receive consistent income.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.
