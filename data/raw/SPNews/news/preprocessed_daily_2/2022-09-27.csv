SWOBX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWOBX. Schwab Balanced Fund made its debut in October of 1996, and since then, SWOBX has accumulated about $709 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by Zifan Tang who has been in charge of the fund since February of 2012.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 5.8%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 4.99%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWOBX over the past three years is 13.07% compared to the category average of 13.1%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 11.67% compared to the category average of 11.6%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.65, which means it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. With a negative alpha of -2.33, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SWOBX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.50% compared to the category average of 0.86%. From a cost perspective, SWOBX is actually cheaper than its peers.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on SWOBXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

5,6bf2335d-3c1c-3ed8-b78e-0fa8f4bc585b,ARE,2022-09-27,3 Top Dividend Stocks to Maximize Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-maximize-131001206.html,1664197801,STORY,"['BRX', 'ARE']","[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.18 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.3%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.34% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.83%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.36%. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Brixmor Property (BRX) is paying out a dividend of $0.24 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 5.02% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.76% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 11.63% over the past year. Check Brixmor Property (BRX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.74 per share, Bancolombia (CIB) has a dividend yield of 9.7%. This is compared to the Banks - Foreign industry's yield of 3.75% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 961.04%. Check Bancolombia (CIB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Finance sector lost 8.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 10.4%.Unum will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Unum is projected to report earnings of $1.41 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 36.89%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3 billion, up 0.9% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.12 per share and revenue of $12.07 billion, which would represent changes of +40.69% and +1.08%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Unum. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. UNM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.29 as of yesterday's close.The Insurance - Accident and Health industry is part of the Finance sector.

9,a57e35be-89be-350f-9e85-57748803a8a0,TMO,2022-09-27,When Should You Buy Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-120048884.html,1664280048,STORY,['TMO'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$604 and falling to the lows of US$514. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Thermo Fisher Scientific's current trading price of US$514 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Thermo Fisher Scientific’s ratio of 27.09x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 25.29x, which means if you buy Thermo Fisher Scientific today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe Thermo Fisher Scientific should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward.What does the future of Thermo Fisher Scientific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TMO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TMO? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TMO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Thermo Fisher Scientific as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

The second is Walmart Universe of Play, which is aimed more at kids and has games with characters from such franchises including ""Jurassic World,"" also ""Paw Patrol.""Rachelle, this caught my eye because we know that Walmart has been creative in the past, just in terms of trying new avenues to reach shoppers.

So if this goes well, it will be interesting to see what their future plays could potentially look like within the metaverse.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it does seem to be that sort of safe space to sort of enter the metaverse without fully committing, as we see, obviously, Meta's stock price is still off today because a lot of analysts are saying, look, this metaverse play could be five, 10, 15 years out. But this is a good way to at least establish a presence so that these companies aren't missing out.And obviously, Roblox itself having its own challenges, now trying to sort of introduce ads coming up next year to really try and bolster the growth that they're seeing. But this does seem to be a safer play for Walmart. It's interesting though, because most of Roblox's uses, about 67% of them, are actually under the age of 17. So this is something that obviously will be involving probably parents having to be coughing up a bit of money if their kids want to sort of work on some of these things in the metaverse and buy the skins and do all the fun stuff. So sort of going through the kids to get to the parents, an interesting play here, though.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: It is an interesting play. And you mentioned-- I think this is really for younger shoppers, right, maybe people that aren't shopping at Walmart yet. And we know that Walmart has targeted the younger generation in the past. They've done live streaming events with TikTok and on Twitter. They've also done some AR tools just in terms of Pinterest.I guess this would be for a little bit of older demographic, so maybe people like me and you just in terms of you can use Pinterest and see furniture in your own home, so kind of more of a realistic view before you pull the trigger and actually make some purchases.So Walmart getting further and further into the tech space. It makes a lot of sense. And I also think that they tend to set the bar in this space as well, Rachelle. So if Walmart is doing it, I'm sure we can see some of the competitors not too far behind.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I would think so. And especially when you think holiday shopping season is coming up. Kids are going to be getting ideas for things that they want. And they have all these different places to explore in the metaverse, eventually that does tend to at least somewhat translate into real world purchases.So I think this is a smart play by Walmart. Obviously, they've done things like trying to expand into banking with their consumers as well. So they're really sort of putting the feelers out there. But I think it's a smart move. A long, very long, long play, but at least a safe step into the metaverse for now.]"

The department’s No. 2 official, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, is concerned the agreement doesn’t go far enough to keep the data of US users safe from Chinese actors, one of the people said.The news about the pending agreement was reported earlier by the New York Times.A spokesperson for the Treasury Department said Cfius is committed to taking all actions within its authority to safeguard national security, but doesn’t comment on transactions it may be reviewing.“We will not comment on the specifics of confidential discussions with the US government, but we are confident that we are on a path to fully satisfy all reasonable US national security concerns,” a TikTok spokesperson said.Story continuesRegulators and lawmakers have long feared that Chinese authorities could access US user data via TikTok. These anxieties were revived following a report by BuzzFeed in June that US user data had been repeatedly accessed from China.The same day as the BuzzFeed story, TikTok said it was routing all US user traffic through Oracle Corp.’s cloud, and that the database giant is auditing its algorithms. TikTok and Oracle are expected to continue working together on a storage setup that satisfies US national security concerns, according to a person familiar with the process.While TikTok’s one billion active users makes it smaller than some of its social media peers, it’s growing quickly -- particularly among young people. In June, the app was the second-most-likely used app among Gen Z users, trailing behind Instagram in the top spot, according to analysis from data.ai. It’s also swiftly building its ad business, with eMarketer estimating revenue of $12 billion this year, up from $4 billion in 2021.China hawks on Capitol Hill are expected to criticize any agreement that stops short of forcing the sale of the platform to a US company. Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week urging her to require TikTok to sever all ties with Chinese companies and to force ByteDance to divest itself from TikTok.Hawley hasn’t yet received a response from the department, though Treasury has acknowledged receipt, according to Philip Letsou, Hawley’s communications director.Former President Donald Trump stopped short of banning the app in an effort to broker a deal to sell the platform to a US buyer, which never came to fruition. ByteDance had sought US approval to sell a stake in the app to Oracle and Walmart Inc., but the transaction didn’t materialize. Efforts by the Trump administration to boot TikTok from the Apple and Google app stores were blocked by a US court.A top TikTok executive told senators this month that the company is negotiating with US officials on restricting access to US data for employees in China but declined to commit to a total cutoff.As the Cfius review process continues, the administration is weighing other action, including by the Commerce Department, which is considering a rule that would give the Commerce Secretary more oversight over apps owned by foreign adversaries. If enacted, the rule change would empower the Commerce Department to force TikTok to undergo third-party audits -- or even restrict the app in the US.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

That would place the predicted hike between March and August 2023, he added, ""with next spring, in our view, most likely.""Costco's last membership fee increase kicked in on June 1, 2017. The warehouse club took its Gold Star membership fee up $5 to $60 and executive membership fees increased by $10 to $120.The potential for a membership fee increase is one of the main reasons why Heinbockel is staying bullish on Costco's stock, despite mounting economic pressures on consumers.Here's the details behind the analyst's call.Price Target: N/ARating: Neutral (reiterated)Heinbockel thinks Costco is waiting for the perfect time to lift fees.""The potential membership fee increase is the story that simply won’t end. Investors have been anticipating (and discounting) it for the past year, and, although management remains non-committal as to timing, we expect an increase during second half fiscal 2023. This would be sometime between March and August with next spring, in our view, most likely. This would be after the holidays, higher home heating bills this winter, and moderating food inflation. Sam’s Club’s recent increase is a positive, but Costco's decisions are always independent of the competition.""Shoppers load their car with bottled water at a Costco Wholesalers in Chingford, Britain March 15, 2020. REUTERS/John SibleyA fee increase could serve as a jolt to Costco's top and bottom lines.""With roughly 55 million members in the U.S. and Canada—28 million Executive and 27 million Gold Star—the usual $10 and $5 increases would result in $400 million of incremental annual fees. However, this benefit is spread out over two years based on the cadence of renewals and monthly accruals. The impact would be modest in 2023 and much larger in 2024 and 2025.""Story continuesCostco's stock tends to perform well around a fee increase (chart below).""This is always a positive catalyst, usually 6-9 months in advance.

21,80f0c21c-caf0-3b23-8dbd-2810dea60279,JWN,2022-09-27,How live shopping platforms are shaping the future of e-commerce,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live-shopping-platforms-shaping-future-180000380.html,1664215200,STORY,['JWN'],"[Walk down any street in New York City or Beverly Hills or through any mall in, and you’ll likely come across vacant storefront after vacant storefront. Brick-and-mortar retail, once shrouded in prestige, has been on the decline for the better part of a decade, as e-commerce has become the preferred method of shopping for people around the world. And with a seemingly limitless collection of items available online and increasingly speedy shipping, there’s now little need to ever visit a physical store again.But even with all the convenience and access it boasts, there is one obvious absence in the online shopping experience: the curation and guidance offered during a traditional shopping trip. In recent years, however, this dearth in the e-commerce market has given rise to a new approach, live shopping.Although it’s technically been around since the 1980s, with the advent of the HSN and QVC television channels, a handful of tech companies have made it their mission to bring live shopping to more contemporary platforms and younger consumers. With the help of cloud-backed software, these providers have created websites, apps, and programs, where users can watch their favorite seller, influencer, or host introduce a product and can then purchase it without leaving the livestream.Live e-commerce has already taken several countries by storm, generating a predicted $387 billion this year in China alone, and its popularity in the United States is growing by the day. As live shopping platforms, like Bambuser and NTWK, come to the scene in droves and sizable companies—think LVMH, Samsung, and Nordstrom—forge their own paths in the space, many believe it will soon become the dominant approach to shopping on a global level.For Aaron Levant, cofounder and CEO of NTWRK, the potential was clear long ago. “We launched in October 2018 with a simple idea,” he says. “We wanted to a mobile-first, millennial/Gen-Z version of QVC, and we wanted to focus on very niche, pop-culture fandom-driven communities.”Story continuesAt the time, live shopping was a pretty fringe concept in the U.S., but Levant and his cofounders were confident that the expert curation found at select specialist stores and conventions would appeal to customers across the country, particularly those who would not otherwise have access to it.So, NTWRK partnered with well-known creators and vendors to sell exclusive and in-demand merchandise on its app, from hard-to-find comic books and baseball cards to collectible sneakers and streetwear.“We compete with a broad array of direct-to-consumer brands, other static marketplaces, and traditional retailers, but we put it all under one platform,” Levant says. “We offer an interactive experience, but we also put together five or six different genres in one cohesive, shoppable package, and I think that’s our big point of differentiation. With our app, you don’t have to go to five or six different websites to find the product mix and talent that we curate.”NTWRK works by implementing cloud-backed technology that uses APIs to sync with sellers’ existing ecommerce backend database and allows them to broadcast live on the app. But these sellers aren’t just store-owners and hired hosts; more often than not, they’re celebrity creators or celebrated authorities behind an item or category.“We’ve had Odell Backham, Jr. sell his exclusive pair of Nikes, Billie Eillish sell her collectible action figure, and DJ Khaled sell his Beats by Dre headphones,” Levant says. “And unlike YouTube or Instagram Live, where these creators have broadcast historically, we layer on the native commerce, so you can do a quick purchase directly on NTWRK without having to leave the livestream.”The live shopping company has seen continued growth since its 2018 launch and has doubled in size each year, but while Levant believes NTWRK’s surge in popularity was always bound to happen, he knows the COVID-19 pandemic played a big role. “Business took off beyond our wildest dreams at that stage, and we weren’t expecting that,” he notes.NTWRK now has thousands of sellers and more than three and a half million users on its platform, and Levant and his cofounders feel validated in the bet they made on live shopping years earlier—but they’re not the only ones.After seeing growing consumer demand for an improved online shopping experience during the pandemic, Nordstrom launched a live shopping channel in early 2021. “How the customer shops, from discovery through delivery, has evolved to become increasingly digital, and the pandemic has only further accelerated these changes in behavior as customers are increasingly connected and mobile,” a spokesperson for the retailer says. “We launched this offering with the goal of meeting the ever-changing needs and expectations of our customers and empowering our team with tools to deliver on our commitment to serve our customer wherever, whenever and however they want to shop.”Nordstrom’s live shopping platform features dozens of events each month, from highly produced livestreams with runway footage to discussions among industry experts about the latest trends. Each event is shoppable, and customers can interact with the host in real time, asking questions about sizing, color, styling, or any other item specifics. Nordstrom created its channel by partnering with a third-party tech provider, and it’s far from the only retailer to do so. With interest in live shopping on the rise, a growing number of software companies are creating and licensing the technology to retailers and brands.Swedish company Bambuser was among the first to build software that enables live shopping directly on a retailer’s website, where purchases can remain within the native cart experience. The technology, which went to market in late 2019, saw a massive tailwind a few months later, as many retailers, with their brick-and-mortar locations closed, sought new ways to engage customers remotely. Over the last two years, Bambuser has partnered with brands across several industries, including Farfetch, Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and multiple labels owned by LVMH, catering the live shopping technology to the needs of each.Since the B2B company’s primary focus is on licensing its software to brands and retailers, who can use the platform however they see fit, Bambuser designed its technology to be incredibly versatile. “To go live, all they need is a mobile app, a team managing chat and product highlight from a dashboard, and the show that will be broadcasted in a customized player on the website,” explains Sophie Abrahamsson, Bambuser’s president for the Americas. “The live stream can also be simulcasted onto social media or partner websites, which is made possible by a proprietary mobile streaming technology and AWS infrastructure.”While other live shopping providers tend to target a young demographic only, Bambuser believes that there are really no limitations to who could use the platform. “Retailers that have a young audience, who is digital and video savvy, of course have an advantage, and their audiences expect that interactivity,” Ambrahamsson says. “But on the other hand, retailers that experience long purchase funnels due to complex or expensive product ranges can strongly benefit from using live shopping too, since the clients get information and can ask questions, which ultimately significantly increases the purchase intent.”One such retailer is Samsung, which partnered with Bambuser to introduce live e-commerce in May 2021 in an effort to provide an engaging, fun, and informative shopping experience while also highlighting its newest and most popular products. “This became a new channel to showcase the best of Samsung’s sustainability, connectivity, and customization features across an entire ecosystem of products,” says a Samsung spokesperson. “And this format gives the Samsung team an opportunity to answer questions directly from customers via a live chat and effectively show our consumers how Samsung’s connectivity features can help streamline their lives.”It’s this kind of interaction that Bambuser believes is what’s behind much of the software’s success. As the current B2B market leader, the company has experienced 118% year-over-year growth and 286% year-over-year growth in end user adoptions, or viewership.“We believe that live shopping will be an integral part of e-commerce within a few years,” Abrahamsson says. ""The end consumer will shop online just the way they already interact online, and video commerce will continue bridging the gap between the physical and the online retail experiences. What we are seeing now is merely the beginning.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

UDR well for growth. Technological advancements and process enhancements also bode well for the company.The company’s properties are located throughout the United States, which includes a mix of urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations. Therefore, portfolio diversification with respect to geographies and price points limits UDR’s exposure to volatility and concentration risks alongside assuring stable cash flows.In addition, a favorable demographic trend in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent, is likely to fuel the demand for UDR’s properties.UDR’s technological investments and process enhancements are expected to help control future expenses and aid margin expansion and long-term profitability. Its Next Generation Operating Platform supports electronical interaction, provides service to residents and aids its business prospects. These efforts are likely to give the company a competitive edge over its peers.On the balance sheet front, UDR exited second-quarter 2022 with $1.3 billion of liquidity. The company has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule and no consolidated maturities until 2024.Also, investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1(Stable) and BBB+(Stable) from Moody's Investors Service and S&amp;P Global Ratings, respectively, give it favorable access to the debt market. Such a strong financial footing is likely to aid UDR’s long-term growth endeavors.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and UDR remains committed to that. In March 2022, the residential REIT announced a hike in its annualized dividend by 4.7% to $1.52 per share, resulting in a quarterly dividend of 38 cents. It has maintained this payment thereafter.Given its robust balance sheet position and a sustainable cash flow from operations, the dividend payment is likely to be sustainable in forthcoming quarters.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for UDR as it has been increased nearly 1% over the past two months to $2.32.However, its shares have lost 9.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s fall of 6.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegulatory restrictions regarding rent control or rent stabilization by certain states and municipalities have been limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees. Moreover, with government assistance coming to an end, any macroeconomic disturbances could hamper the company’s rental revenue growth in the near term.Although a decent development pipeline is encouraging for UDR’s long-term growth, a huge cost outlay ($599.5 million of which 66.9% was funded as of second-quarter 2022 end) exposes it to various operational risks such as a rise in construction costs, entitlement delays, lease-up risks and funding risks.Further, a hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT sector are Equity Residential EQR, Independence Realty Trust IRT and BRT Apartments BRT.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equity Residential’s 2022 FFO per share has moved 1.7% upward in the past two months to $3.51.

On an absolute dollar basis, the United States and China have been battling for some time for the top spot in the global economy, as China inches ever closer. However, since China has such a large population, its gross domestic product per capita dwindles in comparison to the United States and other countries. While you won't find China anywhere on this GDP-per-capita list of the top 20 economies in the world, you will find two regions whose territories are technically inside China, but are considered independent of China at the same time-Macao and Hong Kong.Here It Is: Our 2022 Small Business SpotlightExplore: Your Biggest Money Etiquette Questions Answered Using data you may even reconsider where you plan to retire.Scanrail1 / Shutterstock.com20.

The biggest contributors to its economy include iron and steel, precision equipment, wood pulp and paper products, processed food and motor vehicles. Barley, wheat, sugar beets, meat and milk round out the agricultural side of the economic equation for Sweden.Take Our Poll: Are You Struggling To Keep Up With Your Utility Bills?Tatiana Bulanova / Shutterstock.com19.

AndorraGDP per capita: $63,600Andorra is a mountainous nation of just 181 square miles lying between France and Spain. The county has an interesting governmental structure, as it's been a parliamentary democracy since 1993, but it retains its chiefs of state in the form of a co-principality, with its two princes being the president of France and the bishop of Seu d'Urgell, Spain. Tourism, particularly skiing, is a main driver of the economy.Story continuesPhilip Ho / Shutterstock.com17. IcelandGDP per capita: $64,621Iceland has seen a tourism boom since 2010, with the growth in annual visitor numbers registering in the double digits for much of the decade. However, more traditional industries, such as fish processing, aluminum smelting, geothermal and hydropower, all pitch in to make Iceland one of the top five economies in the world.VitalyEdush / Getty Images16. AustriaGDP per capita: $64,571Austria is a gorgeous country, and tourism helps boost the country's GDP. Construction, machinery, vehicles and parts, food, metals, chemicals, lumber and paper, and electronics also contribute their share. The federal parliamentary republic produces grains, potatoes, wine, fruit, dairy products, pigs, cattle and poultry.Borisb17 / iStock.com15. NetherlandsGDP per capita: $68,572The Netherlands relies on agro-industries, metal and engineering products, electrical machinery and equipment, chemicals, petroleum, construction, microelectronics and fishing to power its economy. Vegetables, ornamentals, dairy, poultry and livestock products are the main agricultural contributors to the country's economy.weniliou / Shutterstock.com14. TaiwanGDP per capita: $68,730Taiwan is an island in the western Pacific Ocean off the coast of China. Though it has had many economic periods of boom and bust, according to Brittanica, since the 1980s it has remained one of the most significant makers of computers and computer parts. It also has a sizable steel and shipbuilding industry, as well as information and communication technology.balipadma / Shutterstock.com13. DenmarkGDP per capita: $69,273Denmark has an advanced economy that benefits from many diverse industries. Wind turbines, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, shipbuilding and refurbishment, iron, steel and nonferrous metals are key contributing industries, but the country also produces chemicals, machinery and transportation equipment, textiles and clothing, electronics, furniture and other products.alxpin / Getty Images/iStockphoto12.

Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region (SAR)GDP per capita:  $70,448Hong Kong, on the southern coast of China is not a country, per se, but it does exist in a kind of gray area known as a Special Administrative Region ""controlled"" by The People's Republic of China.

BruneiGDP per capita: $74,953The Kingdom of Brunei, formally known as Brunei Darussalam, is a tiny absolute monarchy located on the island of Borneo.

Agriculturally, Brunei produces rice, vegetables and fruits.DenisTangneyJr / Getty Images9. United StatesGDP per capita: $76,027The United States fits the largest population on the list into the second-largest landmass. It has a highly diversified economy with the second-largest industrial output in the world. The main industries in the U.S. encompass everything from petroleum, motor vehicles and steel to aerospace and telecommunications. Numerous agricultural products, including wheat, corn, fruits, vegetables, dairy and forest products, also serve to boost the country's GDP.franckreporter / Getty Images8. NorwayGDP per capita: $77,808Norway is one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, which was proved when it surpassed the $1 trillion mark in its sovereign wealth fund in 2017. Norway gets its economic output from the shipping, fishing, aquaculture, food processing and shipbuilding industries, in addition to petroleum and gas.EXTREME-PHOTOGRAPHER / Getty Images7. United Arab EmiratesGDP per capita: $78,255The United Arab Emirates has a reputation for being a country of immense wealth. So, perhaps it's no surprise that it ranks as the 20th wealthiest nation in spite of its relatively small size. The federation of monarchies, in the form of individual emirates, relies on petroleum and petrochemicals, in addition to fishing, cement, commercial ship repair and textiles to run its economy. Dates are an important agricultural product.montipora / iStock.com6. SwitzerlandGDP per capita: $84,658When you think of Switzerland, you might think of banks and watches.

Macau, SARGDP per capita: $85,611Similar to Hong Kong, Macao, a small peninsula off the province of Guangdong, China, and the islands of Taipa and Coloane, is also a Special Administrative Region ""controlled"" by The People's Republic of China but with some autonomy of its own. This tiny region's economy relies heavily upon tourism and gambling, of all things, to sustain itself, according to Brittanica. You'll find numerous casinos, hotels and bars here.Mlenny / iStock.com4. QatarGDP per capita: $112,789Perhaps surprisingly, the absolute monarchy of Qatar comes in at No. 8 on the list of the top 50 GDPs per capita in the world. While well-known as a producer of oil and natural gas, Qatar also gets major contributions to its GDP from the cement, commercial ship repair, ammonia and fertilizer industries.Courtesy of Old Head Golf Links3. IrelandGDP per capita: $124,596Ireland is known for its beef, potatoes and dairy products -- and its beer -- but a diversified collection of industries lifts the tiny nation's GDP into the top three in the world. Pharmaceuticals, chemicals, medical devices and computer hardware and software are big contributors to Ireland's economy.Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com2. SingaporeGDP per capita: $131,580Tiny Singapore has a diversified economy that benefits from the country's location at the center of a major shipping route. At just 278 square miles, the country is one of the smallest in the study, but it's known for a wide variety of things, from electronics, chemicals, financial services, oil drilling equipment and petroleum refining to biomedical products, scientific instruments, processed food and beverages, and telecommunication equipment. Befitting of Singapore's seaside location, companies also perform ship repair and offshore platform construction, and the country takes part in entrepot trade.tibu / Getty Images/iStockphoto1. LuxembourgGDP per capita: $140,694With a landmass of only 998 square miles, there's plenty of money floating around in Luxembourg, which no doubt helped contribute to the nation's estimated 1.95% population growth in 2019. Banking and financial services play a huge role in Luxembourg's economy, but to claim the No. 1 spot as the richest country in the world, the constitutional monarchy's economy is necessarily diversified. Construction, real estate services, metals and information technology all play an important role in the country's economy.More From GOBankingRatesThe Safest Places To Retire Outside the USCheck Out Readers' Favorite Small Businesses in Our 2022 Small Business SpotlightThis Credit Score Mistake Could Be Costing Millions Of Americans13 Ways To Invest That Don't Involve the Stock MarketJohn Csiszar contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The 20 Richest Countries in the World]"

After clawing back some of the losses, it’s been onto the slide again with the S&amp;P 500 almost back to the mid-June lows.The bad news, according to billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is that things could still get worse from here.“I think a lot of things are cheap, and they’re going to get cheaper,” said Icahn, pointing to the economic malaise, and laying the blame squarely at the Fed’s feet, whose years-long fast and easy monetary policy Icahn see as the main reason behind 2022’s rampant inflation.""We printed up too much money, and just thought the party would never end,"" he went on to say before announcing that the “party's over now.” For most, for sure, but it looks like Icahn’s nous has kept him way ahead of the pack this year too. Throughout the first six months of 2022, Icahn Enterprises’ net asset value rose by 30%.So, it might be prudent for investors to follow Icahn’s lead right now and do so by leaning into the classic defensive play – dividend stocks.With this in mind, let’s take a look at a pair of dividend stocks which form part of the activist investor’s portfolio; Both stocks significantly outperformed the market this year -- highlighting their defensive strength in the current bearish environment. In tandem, we’ll open up the TipRanks platform and see how Wall Street’s analyst corps feel about these two choices.FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)We’ll kick off with FirstEnergy, an electric utility whose ten operating companies make up one of the country’s biggest investor-owned electric systems. The company provides electricity to millions of clients in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions – all the way from the Ohio-Indiana border to the New Jersey shore. That is the main bread and butter for FE but it also has transmission operations; these include around 24,000 miles of lines and a pair regional transmission operation centers.Story continuesThe past few years have seen the revenue haul stay pretty steady - ranging between $10.61 billion and $11.06 billion annually. In the latest set of results – for 2Q22 - revenue just outperformed that trend, growing by 7.7% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, while also beating the Street’s call by $70 million. The company also just beat expectations on the bottom-line, with adj. EPS of $0.53 coming in $0.01 above the $0.52 forecast.As far as the dividend is concerned, it has remained steady at a quarterly payout of $0.39, providing a yield of 3.85%, above the sector average of 2.74%.All of this makes for an interesting stock, at a time when defensive plays are gaining ground, and it’s clear that Carl Icahn would agree. His Icahn Capital hedge fund owns 18,967,757 shares worth $748 million right now.However, there are some big changes taking place at FE. The company recently announced the retirement of president and CEO Steven Strah.This does not stop Morgan Stanley’s David Arcaro from rating the stock an Overweight (i.e., Buy). With a price tag of $53, the analyst believes shares could surge 33% in the next twelve months. (To watch Arcaro’s track record, click here)Backing his bullish stance, Arcaro writes: ""We think the conclusion of the management review and the management transition underway together begin to resolve a key overhang on the stock around CEO uncertainty.”The analyst added, “The potential for an accretive sale of a minority interest in the business and resulting improvement to the balance sheet supports a higher valuation and could come in the next few months. Execution on earnings through the year will help build the company's track record and we think 2023 guidance next February could help reduce the investor concern related to pension EPS headwinds next year. Finally, the stock could begin to price in the possibility of M&amp;A given the management transition.”So, that’s Morgan Stanley’s view, let’s take a look now at what the rest of the Street has in mind for FE. Based on 4 Buys and Holds, each, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $39.75 and the $45.38 average price target implies an upside of ~15% from that level. (See FE stock forecast on TipRanks)Southwest Gas Holdings (SWX)For the next stock, will cross country to Southwest Gas, a Las Vegas, Nevada-based energy infrastructure holding company.As part of Its regulated operations, the company provides natural gas, and boasts more than 2 million residential, commercial, and industrial clients in Nevada, Arizona, and California. The company also owns MountainWest Pipelines, an owner of 2,000 miles of interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. These are located in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.The unregulated arm of the business consists of Centuri, a utility infrastructure services company which caters to the North American utility, energy, and industrial markets.Southwest has capitalized on the rising energy prices, as was evident in its latest financial statement – for 2Q22. Revenue increased by 40% year-over-year to $1.15 billion. However, the company was impacted by higher-than-anticipated expenses and supply chain snags which impacted the bottom-line. As such, EPS of -$0.10 fell some distance short of the $0.54 expected on Wall Street.That had no effect on the dividend, however, which stands at a quarterly rate of $0.62, providing a yield of 3.15%.It will be hardly surprising to learn that much of Icahn’s success this year has been by backing the energy sector – given the global crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is the one segment of the market which has rewarded investors. SWX stock has provided returns of ~12% on a year-to-date basis, far better than any of the major indexes, which all sit firmly in negative territory.Icahn is evidently confident SWX will keep on outperforming. After loading up on shares in Q2, Ichan made another purchase in August, and he now owns ~5.8 million SWX shares worth around $445 million. With an 8.6% stake, Icahn is the company’s third largest shareholder.Like Icahn, Argus analyst Kristina Ruggeri likes the look of SWX, and sees the Q2 headwinds abating.“The company was hurt this quarter by higher than planned operation and maintenance expense, higher interest expense from the MountainWest acquisition, proxy settlement costs and supply chain challenges that hindered infrastructure projects,” Ruggeri commented. “Southwest should overcome these challenges later this year. We have a favorable view of its long-term potential and its dividend, which yields about 3%. We note that the company is in the process of settling a rate case that should add over $50 million in annual rate relief and at least a 9.3% return on equity.”Accordingly, Ruggeri rates SWX stock a Buy, while her $100 price target implies 12-month share appreciation of ~31%. (To watch Ruggeri’s track record, click here)Overall, SWX receives a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The stock has 5 recent reviews, including 2 Buys and 3 Holds. However, following the shares’ outperformance, the $76.01 average target suggests most think they are currently fairly valued.

The company reiterated its non-GAAP operating margin forecast for the fiscal year at approximately 20.4%.On the same day, the company also revealed that it anticipates reaching $50 billion in annual revenues by fiscal 2026, reflecting a CAGR of 17%. The company expects a non-GAAP operating margin for FY26 at more than 25%, driven by reducing non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues below 35% during the fiscal year.According to an IDC study, Salesforce and its partners together are likely to create 9.3 million new jobs and $1.6 trillion in new business revenues globally by FY26.

Now a little known startup is seeking to tap that demand and is winning fans.Most Read from BloombergMacKenzie Scott Files for Divorce From Science Teacher HusbandMeta to Cut Headcount for First Time, Slash Budgets Across TeamsTop Apple Executive Is Leaving After Making Crude Remarks in TikTok VideoMarjorie Taylor Greene’s Husband Files for Divorce After 27 YearsStocks Plummet to 22-Month Low as Fed Hawks Circle: Markets WrapThough not exactly a household name, Shenzhen-based Ratingdog has slowly been carving out a name for itself within China’s corporate-bond community by flagging risks well before defaults occur. Some creditors and fund managers, long used to seeing domestic raters assign “AAA” and “AA” levels for even defaulters, are turning to independent research firms such as Ratingdog to navigate a nascent market amid a liquidity crisis.The startup is challenging China’s broken credit-rating system, as authorities try to revamp it with new rules in the wake of the property-market meltdown led by developers including China Evergrande Group. The tiny credit assessor, which relies on funding from investors rather than issuers, has signed up almost 50,000 registered users -- more than a 50-fold jump in less than four years -- and its two WeChat accounts have garnered over 150,000 followers.Investment managers like Li Gen said there’s demand for more such relatively independent companies. “They update ratings more frequently and can provide a perspective beyond that of traditional agencies,” said Li, chief executive officer of Beijing BG Capital Management Ltd. “Such new additions will benefit the long-term development of the credit market.”Started as a part-time gig in 2017 by a group of frustrated buy-side analysts led by Yao Yu, Ratingdog, whose website features a border collie pup named “A-bu” as its mascot, has today grown into an operation with over 40 staff members.Story continuesThe firm undertakes unsolicited reviews of companies and offers ratings to registered users free of cost, but charges investors for any additional analysis and research reports. Every weekend, founder Yao answers 50 to 100 questions from investors in the comments section on one of the WeChat accounts, where he publishes some of the firm’s research.In an interview, 43-year-old Yao said about 40% of his clients are local banks and securities firms, while offshore investors are also increasingly keen to use his services.“There was not enough credit research for many asset management firms, and we started an organization that’s almost like a help group,” Yao said. Prior to starting Ratingdog, he worked at CSCI Pengyuan Credit Rating Co. for 11 years in different roles before moving to China Securities Credit Investment Co. in 2015 as general manager of risk control and legal affairs department.20 ShadesYao said his firm has come up with about 20 different shades of ratings, almost like the three global majors.Though there was some buzz around Ratingdog even before the property crisis, it drew the attention of investors in August 2021 when it downgraded Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. and its onshore unit Shanghai Shimao Co. from the equivalent of investment grade to high-yield, highlighting credit risks at what was once one of China’s largest real-estate developers. Almost a year later, Shimao missed payment on a $1 billion dollar note, its first default on a public bond after months of mounting stress, while its onshore unit delayed some domestic payments.Yet to this day, Shanghai Shimao remains an AAA-rated entity -- practically the same as China’s sovereign -- in the eyes of Chinese firm China Lianhe Credit Rating Co., which declined to comment. In a June report, Lianhe said Shimao is under significant payment pressure, but expects recovery in its rental business to supplement cash flow.Note: Ratingdog’s rating ranges from 0 (equivalent of AAA) to 10 (equivalent of C) with +/- signs. A larger number and the “-” sign both represent a higher default risk.“The existing ratings in the Chinese market are highly concentrated in the AA to AAA range, while international investors are more used to seeing more granular ratings in the global market to form their investment decisions,” according to Gina Huang, chief executive officer of S&amp;P Global (China) Ratings.“While what’s happening in the property market could affect investor confidence in the sector and the overall bond market, we’ve also seen a growing consensus about the need for greater transparency and analytical rigor,” said Huang.Domestic raters have often been criticized for being overly generous and failing to highlight different shades of credit quality. While issuer-paid models are common around the world, in China they contribute to ratings skewing higher because of relatively low onshore defaults compared to global markets, and strict listing requirements until recently. Both Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses used to require bonds to have ratings of AA or above in order to be listed. That listing rule was scrapped in updated regulations this year as part of regulators’ attempts to address the shortcomings.But such concerns aren’t new, nor are they specific to China. Even giants including S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have had their fair share of trouble with regulators and lawmakers. More than a decade ago, they were partly blamed by regulators for fueling a housing bubble by handing out top grades on debt tied to risky mortgages, a market that collapsed in 2007 and sparked the global financial crisis. They faced close scrutiny, and even lawsuits in some cases.But in China, authorities have found only limited success. The default rate of Chinese issuers with top domestic ratings is higher compared to the global market, according to a research note from CSCI Pengyuan in July, which studied default data onshore and globally between 2014-2022. The report found the average default rate of AAA-rated bonds over eight years was 4.49% domestically, while the number was 0.13% for those rated by Moody’s.Regulators including China’s central bank have tightened supervision of the credit rating industry, with rules issued in August 2021 calling for the evaluation of default rates to be at the core of rating mechanisms and encouraging issuers to choose more than one agency to conduct ratings. They have also given approvals to local units of S&amp;P and Fitch, though the two largely confine themselves to monitoring financial institutions.The new rules also encourage unsolicited ratings from agencies and investor-paid services, which is Ratingdog’s business model.China’s bond market is still in its infancy, and investors and issuers need to be educated on the benefits of more stringent rating processes, said Danny Chen, chief executive officer of Fitch (China) Bohua Credit Ratings Ltd. Rising defaults will lead to deeper changes, said Jim Veneau, head of Asian fixed income at AXA SA.“Now China is accumulating a default history, so that history will then be utilized in terms of projecting future default probabilities,” said Veneau. “That will ultimately lead to more credit differentiation.”Focused on EyeballsThe growth in Ratingdog’s user base, however, hasn’t translated to a corresponding jump in revenue, which it projects to rise sixfold to a modest 30 million yuan ($4.3 million) in 2022 from two years ago. Yao said the company is currently focused more on attracting eyeballs.“The free content doesn’t generate revenues directly, but is still valuable to the company,” said Yao. “The more free content we have, the more familiar others will be with us and the less we need to spend on marketing.”Yao acknowledged that it’s difficult to generate revenue from ratings alone, but said he wants to use it as a tool to provide paid services around it. If the business hits a bottleneck, he could consider new businesses such as creating indexes, he said.But for now, some investors say they have at least one credible alternative.“In the current onshore market where ratings are disorderly and severely lagging, the market is lacking pricing basis,” said Li Kai, chief investment officer at Beijing Shengao Fund Management Co. “New rating agencies such as Ratingdog are valuable and meaningful to investors.”(Updates with comment in 13th paragraph.

Reed Hastings complied, cutting data output by about 25% for a month. So did YouTube.It didn’t matter there was little evidence that networks were overloaded, or the fact Netflix already adapts video quality based on the capacity of the network it’s on. Politicians were alarmed at the prospect that millions of miles of cables and tens of thousands of antennas under their jurisdiction might be at the mercy of Silicon Valley, right when Europe became reliant on internet access to live and work through Covid-19 lockdowns.So the European Union waded into an argument local broadband operators had been making for a decade: should Big Tech chip in for the telecom infrastructure they use?Broadband operators argued that the rewards from suddenly carrying 40% more downstream traffic and double the upstream traffic during the pandemic went to US tech platforms, while they were stuck footing the bill. The Stoxx 600 Europe Telecommunications Index has lost a quarter of its value in the last five years, while the NYSE FANG+ Index tracking the biggest tech stocks has more than doubled.Now policymakers are beginning to share the carriers’ fears that if Europe continues to leave all the investment to telecom operators, its digital grid and the businesses built on top could fall behind those of the US and Asia.Story continues“It’s time to see if our regulation and organization of the infrastructure supporting our digital space is relevant or not,” Breton said in an interview with Bloomberg this month. One of the questions, he said, includes “who should pay what.”Tech companies are quick to rebut these arguments. They do invest in infrastructure: Meta and Alphabet have spent billions of dollars laying underwater cables between continents, adding tens of billions of dollars to Europe’s economy, according to research funded by Meta. Netflix has installed thousands of server boxes in more than 700 EU cities, to compress and store video locally so it doesn’t jam networks. In a push to get more people connected to the internet - and Facebook - Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has backed tools and initiatives to speed up telecom rollouts.“We partner with European internet service providers to make networks more efficient,” said a Netflix spokesperson. “We operate more than 700 caching locations in Europe, so when consumers use their internet connection to watch Netflix, the content doesn’t travel long distances. This reduces traffic on broadband networks, saves costs, and helps to offer consumers a high-quality experience.”Matt Brittin, Google’s President of EMEA, said at an event in Brussels that it’ll be customers who pay “either with price or pay in worse services,” if Europe adds a streaming fee.For a few years, telecom companies and suppliers were themselves the hottest stocks, offering consumers the latest gadgets. Millions paid to send texts on Nokia phones branded with Orange SA and Vodafone logos.But after the launch of the iPhone in 2007 and the rise of social media, the ground began to shift. The likes of BT Group Plc spent billions laying fiber optic cables and installing antennas so their customers could continue downloading apps and streaming videos from other companies.Large countries like France, Spain and Italy, as well as key European parliamentarians, back the push to make streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube pay their “fair share” to support infrastructure upgrades. But other influential countries like Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands are warier. Even some who back the general concept don’t know how to make it work. Some officials are asking whether the issue is Big Tech’s lack of investment, or rather the fragmentation of the telecom market itself.In the US, there are now just three big mobile companies, while the EU contains nearly 40 large players, whose mergers have been blocked, making it nearly impossible to keep up, the telcos argue. That’s sparked concerns Europe might fall behind: just 2.5% of mobile connections were over 5G in Europe in 2021, versus 14.2% in the US and 28% across China, Japan and Korea, according to GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the global mobile trade group. In time that could mean losing out on the next big 5G startup, or industrial investments, operators say.“We have to consider that telco markets in Europe are much less attractive than in the US,” said Germany’s Andreas Schwab, who led the Digital Markets Act negotiations in the European Parliament. “This is a problem that we have to deal with as the 5G expansion is needed,” adding there is “no doubt that some non-telcos have a huge business” running on telecom operators’ networks.Europe’s biggest telecom operators like Vodafone constantly talk about the need for consolidation – and the EU’s appetite to allow it will now be tested anew with the planned merger of Orange and Masmovil in Spain.For now, the EU’s focus is on whether streaming sites should pay for how much traffic they use. Ideas include making companies pay for the precise amount of data they use; creating a fund – possibly overseen by governments – to invest in infrastructure; or – in a proposal supported by Spain’s Telefonica – requiring tech companies to negotiate deals directly with the carriers.“This is not a question of ‘you big American platforms, please be generous to us, because you are so huge,” Telefonica’s head of public policy Juan Montero Rodil said in an interview. “Not at all. What we are speaking about is paying a price for a service we deliver.”Only a handful of firms are in the phone companies’ sights: Britain’s BT said that four-fifths of the data clogging their cables can at times be driven by just four companies, in a submission to digital regulator Ofcom, which is reviewing net neutrality rules aimed at ensuring internet service providers do not control what users can and cannot see on the internet. The review is also looking at investment incentives.A report commissioned by Europe’s telecom lobby group ETNO found that 56% of global traffic from 2021 was generated by Google, Meta, Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.Although experts question how accurately companies can determine where data comes from, it’s clear that usage is only likely to increase. And more fonts of data continue to flood in: TikTok traffic over BT’s network has grown twenty-fold in the last year, the company said. Representatives for TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.For now, European carriers are avoiding lawsuits like SK Broadband Co, in South Korea, which sued Netflix claiming the rush to watch hit show Squid Game meant the streamer should be liable for millions of dollars in higher network costs. Korea also passed a so-called Netflix Law which holds online content providers accountable if they fail to maintain stable services, according to local news agency Yonhap.BT executive Marc Allera likened a ‘fair use’ payment to how Netflix still pays to ship thousands of DVDs to old school subscribers.“Net neutrality applies a set of regulation over what should be a free state to operate in the way you see fit,” he said in an interview. On the responsibility of big tech platforms, he asked: “Do they have any stake in the game, any contribution to make to these once-in-a-generation networks that are effectively creating all of the value and usage for them?”“I think there is a role greater than what it is today – which is close to zero.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerWould You Invest $10,000 in a Friend’s Startup?

This has was narrower than the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 13.11% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's loss of 10.4% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Microsoft as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.31, up 1.76% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $49.71 billion, up 9.69% from the year-ago period.MSFT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.09 per share and revenue of $219.87 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +9.55% and +10.89%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft should also be noted by investors.

""Bear markets with recessions have ended up being deeper and lasting longer than those without a recession, with the average decline being 35%. So I think we will probably end up seeing this bear market bottom around 3,200.""Stovall's prediction would mark another 14% decline in the S&amp;P 500 from current levels. And if hit, that would represent an approximate 33% drop from the Jan. 3, 2022 record high — roughly in line with the long-term averages seen during a recession called out by Stovall.To be sure, the action in the markets are supportive of Stovall's bearish analysis.With rising fears over the path of interest rates, volatile foreign exchange moves and slowing growing economic growth, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are all down by double-digit percentages year to date.

They're wrong,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bosses-think-workers-dont-want-164632629.html,1664210792,STORY,['MSFT'],"[The fissure in remote work and return to office discourse seems to grow week-to-week. The chasm is so wide at this point that so many narratives and talking points are lost in the middle.Lately, attention has turned to the elusive remote worker. Company leaders don't think workers are productive enough when working from home—whatever ""productivity"" really means in their heads. A recent Microsoft survey found that despite a vast majority of bosses questioning whether workers were doing enough at home, productivity might actually be higher than it was pre-pandemic.Good luck convincing the people running companies of that. Remote workers have remained in company crosshairs to the point that bosses have begun tracking employee data such as key strokes to measure of how productivity people are.""We call this productivity paranoia: Leaders are worried their people aren’t working enough, while many employees are working more than ever,"" Jared Spataro, Microsoft's corporate vice president of modern work, wrote for Fortune.So let's attempt to crawl out of this 1984-esque fissure for a moment, because this is all pointing to a narrative companies seem to have been peddling: That workers pushing back against return-to-office mandates simply want to trade in offices for their living rooms, kitchen tables, and second bedrooms where they can twiddle their thumbs, quiet quit, and phone it in.But that narrative is false; most people don't want to work remotely full-time. Bosses are panicking over a trend they're creating in their own heads.On average, only 31% of workers are vying to be fully remote, according to data from Stanford professor Nick Bloom and WFH Research. And the fear around young employees wanting to work from home forever couldn't be more misplaced. Workers age 20-29 are the least likely to prefer working fully remote, at 24%. Bloom attributes this to their need for in-person mentoring and socializing. Those age 30-39 are the next tier up, with 29% preferring fully-remote work, and it trends upward as workers' age increases.Story continuesView this interactive chart on Fortune.comWhat has remained true is that flexibility is a top priority for workers. That's been the case since the idea of returning to work was a twinkle in the pandemic's eyes. As Bloom says, they prefer to have the freedom to go to offices two or three times a week when it suits them.I myself tend to stay home Monday and Friday and then let my Outlook calendar dictate how much I'm physically in the office Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I'm pretty basic, because that's the case for a lot of workers today.Bosses seem to be butting up against the idea that work likely won't return to what it looked like in 2019. What's clear is that we need to rethink in what the future of work looks like and what role the physical office—or simply meeting place—plays.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Amazon is setting up three large-scale solar projects in Rajasthan, India.The company is setting up its first rooftop solar projects in France and Austria, and its first solar farm in Poland.Amazon is gearing up to infuse an additional 1 GW of clean energy capacity across its first two renewable energy projects in Louisiana.Renewable energy produced by the new projects will be utilized in powering AWS data centers, Amazon’s fulfillment centers, stores and corporate offices.We believe that the latest move bodes well for the company’s goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteAmazon’s Aggressive StanceAmazon has been shifting its focus from fossil fuels to clean energy for quite some time now. The shift to clean energy sources is anticipated to reduce costs in the near term, which is a major positive. The company can generate healthy returns from strengthening solar and wind investments as there are several associated tax incentives.Amazon, known as the biggest corporate investor in renewable energy, currently has 379 renewable energy projects across 21 countries, out of which 154 are wind and solar farms, and 225 are rooftop solar projects. All the projects account for 18.5 GW of renewable energy capacity.Growing investments in the projects have accelerated the pace of Amazon’s journey toward powering its infrastructure with 100% renewable energy. The goal was initially targeted to be met by 2030, which is now expected to be achieved by 2025.In 2021, the company reached 85% renewable energy across its business.Amazon’s zero-carbon goals, growing efforts toward reducing its carbon footprint, achievement and execution so far, and benefits from the initiatives are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.Notably, Amazon has lost 31.7% on a year-to-date basis against the industry’s decline of 34.1%.Apart from the latest move, the company’s climate-friendly program, which focuses on environment-friendly products, remains a major positive. Under the new program, customers can view the Climate Pledge Friendly label, while purchasing more than 25,000 products.The company’s growing efforts toward converting its entire delivery fleet to renewable energy by 2030 remain other positives.Amazon’s recent agreement with Infinium to power its transportation fleet with low-carbon electrofuels is noteworthy. Infinium will supply ultra-low carbon electrofuel, which is fossil-based and made with carbon waste. Amazon will start powering its delivery-trucking fleet with electrofuels in 2023.Beside the Infinium deal, Amazon’s purchase of 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian is noteworthy.The e-commerce giant recently inked a deal with Plug Power. Per the terms, the latter will supply green hydrogen, with which Amazon will power its transportation and building operations by 2025.Story continuesZero-Carbon Mission Gaining SteamThe carbon-free push is gaining strong traction across the technology sector.Not only Amazon but companies like Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and KLA Corporation KLAC are also taking initiatives to lower overall carbon footprints and cut energy bills substantially.Alphabet’s aggressive three-fold strategy, which includes energy efficiency, renewable energy procurement and carbon offsets, remains noteworthy. The company’s division Google has been carbon neutral since 2007. GOOGL is aiming to be carbon-free by 2030.Microsoft is gathering steam to become carbon negative by 2030. By 2050, MSFT aims to remove all emissions, which it has released since its founding year.Meanwhile, KLA is committed to powering its global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030. KLAC is targeting a 46% cumulative reduction in both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 from its 2019 baseline.Nevertheless, we believe that Amazon’s latest move will provide it a boost in this race to be carbon neutral.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(CNW Group/Ontario Power Generation Inc.)Microsoft will procure Clean Energy Credits (CECs) sourced from OPG's carbon-free hydro and nuclear assets in Ontario on an hourly basis. This will enable Microsoft to advance progress on its 100/100/0 by 2030 goal whereby Microsoft is committed to powering its datacentres globally with carbon-free energy, around the clock.Revenue raised through sale of CECs can be used to benefit ratepayers and support investments in new clean generation in the province, helping to meet increased demand for electricity to power Ontario's economic growth.Along with the purchase of CECs from OPG, the two companies will also collaborate on several important sustainability initiatives, including:Co-developing an hourly energy matching platform that utilizes Microsoft Azure IoT and AI technology to match a customer's power needs with local carbon-free energy sources, giving customers greater transparency and accuracy on their emissions impact.OPG has chosen Microsoft's Azure as its cloud platform to modernize applications, IT infrastructure and services.  By accelerating migration to the cloud and transforming business operations, OPG will also reduce its carbon footprint.OPG and Microsoft will explore digital co-innovation opportunities to accelerate OPG's Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program, with a goal of developing a service that other global energy providers can leverage in the future to deploy SMRs locally to fast-track clean energy solutions.Beyond the CEC agreement currently in place, under a recently signed Memorandum of Understanding, Microsoft and OPG will evaluate procurement of CECs associated with the carbon-free energy produced by the soon-to-be-constructed SMR at the Darlington New Nuclear Project site.Story continuesAs part of the partnership, OPG has also joined the CEO Pledge, an initiative launched by Microsoft Canada, to commit its used technology to the Government of Canada's Computers for Schools Plus (CSF+) program, with the goal of bridging the digital divide. The two companies will also roll-out a series of digital skilling initiatives to provide Indigenous communities with tangible opportunities, including skills-building to increase economic and employment options.Quotes:""This innovative partnership will not only spur economic development in Ontario, but also serve as a model for other companies and jurisdictions to encourage use of clean hydro and nuclear power,"" said Ken Hartwick, OPG President and CEO. ""As part of OPG's Climate Change Plan, we committed to achieving net zero as a company by 2040, and to act as a catalyst for efficient economy-wide decarbonization. Ensuring industry has access to clean energy to offset emissions assists in meeting that goal.""""We can only address climate change by tackling the challenge collectively. Agreements like this one with OPG will help Microsoft move closer to achieving our sustainability commitments, including our goal of having 100 percent of our electricity consumption, 100 percent of the time, matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030."" said Chris Barry, President, Microsoft Canada. ""Working closely with like-minded organizations like OPG, will help us move toward a more sustainable future, while continuing to power innovation in Ontario.""""As environmental goals increasingly influence corporate decisions on where to invest and grow, this partnership between OPG and Microsoft illustrates the potential for Ontario's Clean Energy Credit registry to draw businesses from across the world to our province,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Energy.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Barrett Business Services is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Paychex has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that BBSI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.BBSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.36, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 27.76. We also note that BBSI has a PEG ratio of 0.88. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.70.Another notable valuation metric for BBSI is its P/B ratio of 3.16. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 13.46.These metrics, and several others, help BBSI earn a Value grade of A, while PAYX has been given a Value grade of D.BBSI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PAYX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that BBSI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It continues to innovate and scale creative store concepts to serve customers and communities, such as Signing Stores that provide employment opportunities for Deaf and hard of hearing partners (employees), Heritage Culture Gallery Stores that bring heritage culture closer to Chinese consumers, and a co-working space concept store providing flexible, on-demand co-working spaces for mobile professionals.Story continuesShanghai Lippo Plaza StoreThe new Shanghai Lippo Plaza Store bears testament to the continuous evolution of Starbucks stores in China’s dynamic consumer landscape. It features a clean and streamlined design, brought to life with minimalist style furniture and casework made using recycled straw material. Old green aprons donned by Starbucks partners were upcycled to create the store’s signature artwork – an iconic Starbucks siren with intricate design details that relay important milestones in Starbucks journey in China. From the store’s mall entrance, customers are greeted by a mug wall made up of a vast collection of Starbucks signature city mugs launched over the years.Beyond its contemporary design, the evolution of Starbucks stores is also reflected in the Shanghai Lippo Plaza Store’s back-of-house operations, where investments in digital technologies have enhanced the partner experience and elevated store efficiency to a whole new level. The use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and automation tools have dramatically simplified routine stocktaking tasks, enabling partners to focus on coffee craft and customer connection. Big data and machine learning algorithms have also been deployed to optimize inventory ordering and labor scheduling. These technologies have been scaled to all stores in operation market-wide, as the company continues to advance its digital transformation agenda.The Shanghai Lippo Plaza Store is also the latest of Starbucks growing portfolio of Greener Stores in China. From design to construction and operations, it incorporates sustainability solutions to achieve reductions in carbon, water and waste. Among its features, the store uses smart, energy efficient solutions for air conditioning, lighting, water usage and daily energy consumption.

Customers are invited to join Starbucks on its journey towards reusables by bringing their own cups or choosing a Grande-sized reusable cup when ordering beverages for on-the-go consumption.Shanghai Coffee in Crema Ristretto styleAlongside the planned opening of the Shanghai Lippo Plaza Store, Starbucks has also specially created a signature handcrafted coffee beverage for coffee lovers in Shanghai – Shanghai Coffee in Crema Ristretto style. As the official coffee industry partner for Shanghai’s city image promotion, and in partnership with IP SHANGHAI, Starbucks is launching the beverage on September 28 across all Starbucks stores in the city.Shanghai Coffee in Crema Ristretto style is inspired by nostalgic Shanghainese childhood flavors given a distinctive Starbucks spin. It is a delicious creation made with malt, cream and smoky Starbucks ristretto espresso, infused with butter scotch flavored syrup offering layers of flavors and aromas. The first sip offers the comforting taste of Shanghai’s very own beloved malt powder, followed by the smooth taste of cold foam infused with the sweet, delicate flavor of butterscotch - a western-style candy loved by Shanghainese. Finally, coffee lovers may immerse in the bright acidity and caramelly depth of the ristretto espresso, to enjoy the artful intertwining of robust coffee flavors with a light and sweet milky aroma.As Starbucks celebrates its latest milestone, the company is still in the early chapters of its China growth story. In this next era of accelerated growth at Starbucks, the company expects to operate 9,000 stores across 300 cities in China by 2025, opening one new store nearly every nine hours in China for the next three years.

Workers at Chipotle Mexican Grill, Trader Joe's grocers and other retailers have also since filed petitions with the national labor board seeking to join unions.The Seattle-based company sent letters to union organizers at 234 stores on Friday, saying that it was available to begin bargaining in October, according to its post on a Starbucks company blog focused on the union's activities.""We look forward to these negotiations and hopefully setting dates and securing locations for contract bargaining,"" the post said.Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, said employees at some stores have waited more than five months to start discussions on issues, including worker safety, discrimination, and respect in the workplace.The union's national bargaining committee has made one priority ""just cause,"" Moore said, a core form of employment security requiring a company to discipline workers for some reason that is fair - as opposed to an frivolous cause such as personal dislike - and often allows the union to settle cases in arbitration.More than 110 Starbucks employees have been terminated for minor issues as retaliation for their union organizing, Moore said.After a federal appeals court ruling, Starbucks said earlier this month that it would rehire seven employees in Memphis who the union said were fired in retaliation for organizing.No Starbucks employees have or will be disciplined for supporting unions, the company said earlier this month. Claims of retaliatory firings are false and Starbucks is disputing them in legal proceedings, it said.(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Aurora Ellis)]"

Posting under the handle @the_hip_barista_, he explained that baristas know when you’re trying to game the system—and they don’t appreciate the trying conditions it creates for them.He's responding to another viral video, in which a user details a cost-effective tip for getting the standard $6.45 Pumpkin Spice Latte for just $2.45: simply order like you’re a part of an intricate Oceans 11 plot line by requesting an iced espresso with customized options like a splash of heavy cream and 2% milk.But @the_hip_barista_ pushed back against this strategy, explaining that these “hacks” cause employees undue stress and extra work. “Stop with the hacks,"" he said. ""Stop making minimum wage workers do circles for you.”When an order sticker looks like a CVS receipt, he said, it’s pretty obvious what the customer wants—and there's a lot of legwork involved in the complicated order that results in a a lose-lose situation for Starbucks workers.As he explained it, splashes of milk are about 4 ounces maximum, less than the typical PSL calls for. Workers fill the cup to the top with milk instead to keep the customer happy, but it angers management, who feels it's a waste of product. But if they keep the milk to a splash, customers complain that their customized drink isn't the latte they wanted, prompting the manager to ask workers to heed the company’s internal catchphrase and “make the moment right.”Just reading about the whole process is enough to spark a stress headache, let alone for the employee who @the_hip_barista_ says has to deal with a backed-up line and lectures from management.Starbucks employees are fed up with their working conditionsSuch lifestyle and consumer hacks have blown up on TikTok recently. Perhaps born out of the rising cost of goods, people are looking to cut corners seemingly now more than ever. Just look at Six Flags’ unlimited meal plan, which also became exploited and untenable once TikTok users shared they were saving up by eating every meal at the park. The hack resulted in clogged lines and lost the company money.Story continuesAs @the_hip_barista_ points out, such discounts come at the price of the workers, who often aren’t earning enough to deal with the agita of it all. “The ‘hack’ is [to] force the minimum wage worker to give them stuff for free,” he wrote in his comments section.Indeed, Starbucks workers have been fighting for better working conditions for some time, as their jobs became more stressful during the pandemic. In the battle for union recognition, some workers created a popular TikTok account named Starbucks Workers United. Over 200 stores have unionized, despite continual pushback from the company.They're part of the many service and retail workers from places like REI, Amazon, and Chipotle, who have started pushing for a union. In the wake of the pandemic, poor working conditions became even more apparent as white-collar workers worked from home and service workers continued to work on the frontlines. A lack of livable wages, dealing with hostile customers, and visible disparate working conditions led to a labor shortage in the restaurant and hospitality sector as workers quit.Already unhappy with their work environment, Starbucks employees feel they have enough on their plates without adding a customized latte hack to their day.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

(SNPS): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-synopsys-inc-130001792.html,1664197201,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Synopsys (SNPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this maker of software used to test and develop chips have returned -14.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -10.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Synopsys falls in, has lost 14.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Synopsys is expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.23 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Synopsys is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Synopsys.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SNPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Synopsys, the consensus sales estimate of $1.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $5.08 billion and $5.67 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.8% and +11.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySynopsys reported revenues of $1.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18%. EPS of $2.10 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Synopsys is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Synopsys. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

President Biden touted the efforts to pressure airlines into changing their policies during a White House event on Monday afternoon.The overall effort — part of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s recent promise to make flying less painful — comes as other key issues such as constant flight cancellations and an ongoing pilot shortage elude quick fixes.""You should know the full cost of your ticket, right when you are comparison shopping to begin with so you can pick the ticket that actually is the best deal for you,"" Biden said Monday.President Joe Biden speaks during the third meeting of the White House Competition Council in the State Dining Room of the White House on September 26. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)The new rules would apply to extra charges such as baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees. They'll also apply to family seating fees that, much to flyers' chagrin, can be tacked onto fares during the last step of the booking process or after the ticket has been purchased — often significantly driving up the price.‘Help travelers make informed decisions’Under the proposed rule, customers searching online would see the fees the first time an airfare is displayed and potential fees for extras such as flight changes and baggage would also need to be shown immediately. The new rule would apply to flights inside the US and those that take off or land in the US.“Airline passengers deserve to know the full, true cost of their flights before they buy a ticket,” Buttigieg said in a statement, adding that the new rules “will help travelers make informed decisions and save money.”A trade group representing major US air carriers, Airlines for America, told Yahoo Finance in a statement that its airlines are already ""committed to providing the highest quality of service, which includes clarity regarding prices, fees and ticket terms.” The statement added: “Passenger carriers provide details regarding the breakdown of airfares on their websites, providing consumers clarity regarding the total cost of a ticket.”Story continuesThe group represents major airlines American (AAL), United (UAL), Delta (DAL), Southwest (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU), Hawaiian (HA), and Alaska (ALK).Monday's move is the latest from the Biden administration to try to improve the flying experience, at least on the margins. Recent efforts have included a new ""Airline Customer Service Dashboard"" as well as dediicating $1 billion to upgrade America’s airport terminals.Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg testifies before Congress in July. (REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger)'Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism'Nonetheless, the more deeply rooted problems such as a shortage of pilots and the related wave of cancellations earlier this summer haven’t proven as open to administration solutions.The Transportation Department is in the midst of a 90-day review process for another new rule around the issue of getting refunds in the event of flight cancellations. The administration is also pursuing enforcement actions against 10 airlines for extreme delays in providing refunds.On Monday, Biden said his administration's efforts were having an effect. “They cancel on you and you have to pay a fee to rebook. C’mon man,” he said. ""It’s simply not fair.""Airlines for America also also said Monday that its members “offer a range of options — including fully refundable fares — to increase accessibility to air travel and to help customers make ticket selections that best fit their needs.”In a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview, Melius Research Director Conor Cunningham noted that some of the overall pressures on flyers could be easing, while acknowledging delays are still a problem. Still, he added, ""Delays are better than cancellations, though obviously not great, but we're moving in the right direction, I guess.""Monday’s announcement came out of the third meeting of Biden’s White House Competition Council, whose members include Buttigieg, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and others. The group has the ambitious mandate of fostering competition across the economy from finance to health care to technology to transportation.Its efforts were also cast by the White House this week as an effort to also bring down costs in the face of inflation. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the average American loses up to $5,000 a year “due to lack of competition.”During his remarks Thursday, Biden applauded the Transportation Department’s move and said other agencies would soon do the same in their areas of influence pointing to fees from internet providers , banks, and cellphone companies.""Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation and we're building an economy that works for everyone,"" Biden said during his remarks.Ben Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.]"

However, escalated fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth and emerging as a key downside.Factors Favoring LUVThe gradual improvement in air-travel demand in the United States is a huge boon for Southwest Airlines. In the second quarter of 2022, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, rose 17.5% year over year. With high passenger volumes, the top line is likely to be boosted in the September quarter.The presence of the Labor Day holiday period in the third quarter should further boost third-quarter passenger revenues. Management expects third-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 9-11% band from the third-quarter 2019 actuals.Efforts to modernize its fleet also bode well. Southwest Airlines' liquidity position also raises optimism on the stock. At the end of the June quarter, the carrier’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $16,431 million, much higher than the current debt of $1,662 million, implying that LUV has sufficient cash to meet its short-term obligations. LUV's current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of the June quarter was 1.66, much higher than its industry's 0.91.Key RisksEscalating fuel prices are a concern. In second-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) surged 75% year over year to $3.36. Economic fuel costs per gallon are forecast to be $3.25-$3.35 for the third quarter, detailed results of which will be out on Oct 27.Apart from the increase in fuel costs, higher labor and airport costs are likely to dent bottom-line growth by spiking operating expenses. Due to the rise in labor and airport costs, and lower productivity levels, LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 12-15% in the ongoing quarter from the comparable period’s level in 2019. High capex may also be a headwind.Story continuesSoftness in business travel is a concern. This weakness is reflected by the fact that managed business revenues declined roughly 26% and 32% in July and August, respectively, from the comparable 2019 levels. As a result, LUV, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), now expects third-quarter 2022 managed business revenues to decline in the 26-28% band from the previous 17-21% range.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks  Transportation  sector are  Triton International  TRTN and  C.H.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) reveals that despite broad public support for disruptive innovation to address global challenges, issues such as lack of equal access are likely to stall progress. Commissioned by PMI and conducted by independent research agency Povaddo, the survey shows that 89 percent of adults across 14 countries believe that new technologies and innovations can play an important role in improving public health. However, 38 percent feel such innovations are not accessible to all citizens in their countries.The more than 17,000 survey respondents aged 21 and older believe that the development and adoption of new technologies, innovations, and capabilities can enable significant progress against a range of issues over the next 10 to 20 years, including:Encouraging healthier eating habits (78 percent)Ensuring quality and affordable healthcare for all (72 percent)Reducing smoking rates (65 percent)Eliminating hunger and malnourishment (62 percent)""Disruptive innovation can drive progress for the world and achieve things few people imagined possible until recently,"" said Grégoire Verdeaux, Senior Vice President, External Affairs, PMI. ""But when the benefits of that disruption are not equally available to all, innovation fails to achieve its full potential. Pragmatic policy frameworks that anticipate innovations are needed so businesses and governments can ensure more equitable outcomes and a lasting impact for all.""The international survey also highlights the potential of positive disruption in tobacco harm reduction—with 64 percent of respondents stating that new technologies and innovations can play an important role in helping replace cigarettes with less harmful alternatives for those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke. These better alternatives exist today thanks to advances in science and technology and significant investments by PMI and other companies.Story continuesHowever, progress is being hindered by public policies that have failed to keep up with innovation. In many countries, the only tobacco or nicotine-containing products that can legally be sold are cigarettes. And in markets where better alternatives are available, adult smokers often cannot access these products or receive accurate information about them.""Today, with technological advances and scientific validation, we have an unprecedented opportunity to enact a major public health breakthrough—to effectively eradicate smoking faster,"" added Verdeaux. ""We can make this the tipping point at which millions of adult smokers are given accurate information about and access to innovative smoke-free products that are a much better choice than continued smoking. But for that to happen, all parties—businesses, governments, public health authorities—must work together.""To deliver positive change quickly and equitably, fresh thinking and concerted action are needed. Findings from the international survey highlight the public’s frustration with policymakers’ performance to date. Specifically:41 percent of respondents believe that government and public health authorities in their countries have done a poor job of embracing new technologies and innovations to improve public health.47 percent believe government and public health authorities have done a poor job of ensuring everyone in their country has access to the latest innovations and technologies that can improve public health.Survey respondents point to collaboration between government and the private sector as a catalyst of innovation, placing it just below capital investments by private companies. Asked to select the greatest enablers of innovation, respondents returned these results:Entrepreneurship (76 percent of respondents say it enables innovation)Consumer demand (74 percent)Capital investments by private-sector companies (72 percent)Collaboration between government and the private sector (69 percent)Competition within the private sector (69 percent)Select results of this new international survey are featured in PMI’s latest white paper, Rethinking Disruption: Innovating for Better in an Era of Division, which explores the dynamics of positive disruption and its potential to drive meaningful progress on tobacco harm reduction and other critical issues. To bring about much-needed change and accelerate the end of smoking, PMI is transforming for good, having fundamentally revamped not just its product portfolio but also its purpose, business model, value chain, and practices. To learn more about how PMI is delivering a smoke-free future faster, visit pmi.com/rethinkdisruption.Survey methodologyPovaddo conducted the online survey on behalf of PMI between July 19 and August 10, 2022. The survey was fielded among 17,207 general population adults aged 21 and older and a booster sample of 201 policy elites and 281 business elites in 14 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Philippines, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States. Approximately 1,100 interviews were collected in each country. Data have been weighted by age, gender, and nicotine product use per market to match national statistics. Results are accurate to a margin of error of ±1 percent. A similar study was commissioned in Saudi Arabia.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of June 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI’s smoke-free products were available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.2 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021 PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

73,34e9a7a9-73c2-3095-b309-3aaf28b60710,SPG,2022-09-27,3 Retail REITs With The Highest Upside According To Analysts,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-retail-reits-highest-upside-200053791.html,1664222453,STORY,"['RPT', 'TGT', 'FRT', 'SPG']","[When you get a 1-2 punch of inflation and recessionary fears as we’ve had in 2022, investors begin to lose faith in the ability of shopping centers and regional malls to thrive under adverse conditions. As a result, the prices of retail stocks have been hit hard in recent months. Analysts have been forced to lower their target prices, yet their upside targets from current levels remain high. Here are three retail REITs that analysts have recently cited as having the highest potential upside:RPT Realty (NYSE: RPT) is a NYC-based REIT that owns, operates and manages 57 open air shopping centers across 16 states, mostly in the Northeastern U.S. RPT Realty has a 93.3% overall occupancy rate in its portfolio of stores. This rate has been fairly stable over the last two years.The 52-week range for RPT is $7.51 to $14.99, but the stock has fallen 42% since last November. The stock is currently sitting right near its 52-week low.2nd quarter 2022 revenue declined, but earnings per share (EPS) was up from the previous quarter. RPT Realty pays a $0.52 annual dividend, yielding just above 6%.Raymond James analyst R.J. Milligan recently maintained an Outperform rating on RPT, while lowering the price target to $13 from $15. At a recent price of $7.55, this creates a huge upside potential of 72%.Federal Realty Investment (NYSE: FRT) is another retail REIT, based in North Bethesda, MD. Federal Realty Investment was established in 1962 and is a member of the S&amp;P 500. The REIT owns and operates 105 retail stores in grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use retail centers.Federal Realty prides itself on having the longest record of annual dividend rate increases among U.S. REITs. The 52-week price range is $86.50 to $140.51. Just like RPT Realty, it is currently sitting near its 52-week low and seems to be in a serious downtrend.However, Milligan continues to see value in the stock. He also maintained a Strong Buy on Federal Realty, even while lowering the price target from $140 to $130. Therefore, from its recent price of $88, the analyst’s view would be that Federal Realty now has an upside potential of 47.7%. That’s a lot of ground to make up, but with its long-standing history, an annual dividend of $4.32 and yield of 4.7%, this REIT could be a long-term winner. However, investors may want to see some price stability first.Story continuesSimon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) is one of the largest and most well-known retail REITs. Simon owns and manages shopping centers and premier outlet malls in 37 states and Puerto Rico. It also owns properties in Asia, Canada and Europe. The Indianapolis-based REIT is a member of the S&amp;P 100.Simon Property Group stock dropped significantly in the 2020 COVID-19 market crash, declining from $128 in January to less than $37 by the end of March. Investors who stayed the course were rewarded when SPG rebounded to $161 by November 2021. However, since then, the stock has again languished due to inflation and recessionary concerns. The stock is hitting new lows for the year.Regardless, Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley recently maintained his Overweight position on Simon, while slightly lowering the target price from $133 to $131. This represents about a 51% potential upside from Simon’s recent price of $86.75. Given the REIT’s history of rebounding, and an annual dividend of $7.00 that yields 7.5%, Simon Property Group could be a substantial bargain at this level.Check out: This Little Known REIT Has Produced Double-Digit Annual Returns For The Past Five YearsPlease bear in mind that analysts’ opinions are not always correct, and the best analysts are only right about half the time. Investors should therefore perform their own due diligence when making decisions about what stocks to buy, and simply use the price targets as a guide.Latest Private Market Real Estate Insights:Arrived Homes expanded its offerings to include shares in short-term rental properties with a minimum investment of $100.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Univar is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while PPG Industries has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that UNVR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.UNVR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.64, while PPG has a forward P/E of 16.68. We also note that UNVR has a PEG ratio of 0.46. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PPG currently has a PEG ratio of 2.31.Another notable valuation metric for UNVR is its P/B ratio of 1.46. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PPG has a P/B of 4.20.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to UNVR's Value grade of A and PPG's Value grade of C.UNVR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PPG, so it seems like value investors will conclude that UNVR is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:NFLX) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 25% in the last quarter. But that's small comfort given the dismal price performance over the last year. Like a receding glacier in a warming world, the share price has melted 62% in that period. It's not that amazing to see a bounce after a drop like that. It may be that the fall was an overreaction.After losing 8.0% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Even though the Netflix share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Netflix managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Netflix will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Netflix shareholders are down 62% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 23%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Reed Hastings complied, cutting data output by about 25% for a month. So did YouTube.It didn’t matter there was little evidence that networks were overloaded, or the fact Netflix already adapts video quality based on the capacity of the network it’s on. Politicians were alarmed at the prospect that millions of miles of cables and tens of thousands of antennas under their jurisdiction might be at the mercy of Silicon Valley, right when Europe became reliant on internet access to live and work through Covid-19 lockdowns.So the European Union waded into an argument local broadband operators had been making for a decade: should Big Tech chip in for the telecom infrastructure they use?Broadband operators argued that the rewards from suddenly carrying 40% more downstream traffic and double the upstream traffic during the pandemic went to US tech platforms, while they were stuck footing the bill. The Stoxx 600 Europe Telecommunications Index has lost a quarter of its value in the last five years, while the NYSE FANG+ Index tracking the biggest tech stocks has more than doubled.Now policymakers are beginning to share the carriers’ fears that if Europe continues to leave all the investment to telecom operators, its digital grid and the businesses built on top could fall behind those of the US and Asia.Story continues“It’s time to see if our regulation and organization of the infrastructure supporting our digital space is relevant or not,” Breton said in an interview with Bloomberg this month. One of the questions, he said, includes “who should pay what.”Tech companies are quick to rebut these arguments. They do invest in infrastructure: Meta and Alphabet have spent billions of dollars laying underwater cables between continents, adding tens of billions of dollars to Europe’s economy, according to research funded by Meta. Netflix has installed thousands of server boxes in more than 700 EU cities, to compress and store video locally so it doesn’t jam networks. In a push to get more people connected to the internet - and Facebook - Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has backed tools and initiatives to speed up telecom rollouts.“We partner with European internet service providers to make networks more efficient,” said a Netflix spokesperson. “We operate more than 700 caching locations in Europe, so when consumers use their internet connection to watch Netflix, the content doesn’t travel long distances. This reduces traffic on broadband networks, saves costs, and helps to offer consumers a high-quality experience.”Matt Brittin, Google’s President of EMEA, said at an event in Brussels that it’ll be customers who pay “either with price or pay in worse services,” if Europe adds a streaming fee.For a few years, telecom companies and suppliers were themselves the hottest stocks, offering consumers the latest gadgets. Millions paid to send texts on Nokia phones branded with Orange SA and Vodafone logos.But after the launch of the iPhone in 2007 and the rise of social media, the ground began to shift. The likes of BT Group Plc spent billions laying fiber optic cables and installing antennas so their customers could continue downloading apps and streaming videos from other companies.Large countries like France, Spain and Italy, as well as key European parliamentarians, back the push to make streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube pay their “fair share” to support infrastructure upgrades. But other influential countries like Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands are warier. Even some who back the general concept don’t know how to make it work. Some officials are asking whether the issue is Big Tech’s lack of investment, or rather the fragmentation of the telecom market itself.In the US, there are now just three big mobile companies, while the EU contains nearly 40 large players, whose mergers have been blocked, making it nearly impossible to keep up, the telcos argue. That’s sparked concerns Europe might fall behind: just 2.5% of mobile connections were over 5G in Europe in 2021, versus 14.2% in the US and 28% across China, Japan and Korea, according to GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the global mobile trade group. In time that could mean losing out on the next big 5G startup, or industrial investments, operators say.“We have to consider that telco markets in Europe are much less attractive than in the US,” said Germany’s Andreas Schwab, who led the Digital Markets Act negotiations in the European Parliament. “This is a problem that we have to deal with as the 5G expansion is needed,” adding there is “no doubt that some non-telcos have a huge business” running on telecom operators’ networks.Europe’s biggest telecom operators like Vodafone constantly talk about the need for consolidation – and the EU’s appetite to allow it will now be tested anew with the planned merger of Orange and Masmovil in Spain.For now, the EU’s focus is on whether streaming sites should pay for how much traffic they use. Ideas include making companies pay for the precise amount of data they use; creating a fund – possibly overseen by governments – to invest in infrastructure; or – in a proposal supported by Spain’s Telefonica – requiring tech companies to negotiate deals directly with the carriers.“This is not a question of ‘you big American platforms, please be generous to us, because you are so huge,” Telefonica’s head of public policy Juan Montero Rodil said in an interview. “Not at all. What we are speaking about is paying a price for a service we deliver.”Only a handful of firms are in the phone companies’ sights: Britain’s BT said that four-fifths of the data clogging their cables can at times be driven by just four companies, in a submission to digital regulator Ofcom, which is reviewing net neutrality rules aimed at ensuring internet service providers do not control what users can and cannot see on the internet. The review is also looking at investment incentives.A report commissioned by Europe’s telecom lobby group ETNO found that 56% of global traffic from 2021 was generated by Google, Meta, Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.Although experts question how accurately companies can determine where data comes from, it’s clear that usage is only likely to increase. And more fonts of data continue to flood in: TikTok traffic over BT’s network has grown twenty-fold in the last year, the company said. Representatives for TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.For now, European carriers are avoiding lawsuits like SK Broadband Co, in South Korea, which sued Netflix claiming the rush to watch hit show Squid Game meant the streamer should be liable for millions of dollars in higher network costs. Korea also passed a so-called Netflix Law which holds online content providers accountable if they fail to maintain stable services, according to local news agency Yonhap.BT executive Marc Allera likened a ‘fair use’ payment to how Netflix still pays to ship thousands of DVDs to old school subscribers.“Net neutrality applies a set of regulation over what should be a free state to operate in the way you see fit,” he said in an interview. On the responsibility of big tech platforms, he asked: “Do they have any stake in the game, any contribution to make to these once-in-a-generation networks that are effectively creating all of the value and usage for them?”“I think there is a role greater than what it is today – which is close to zero.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerWould You Invest $10,000 in a Friend’s Startup?

Netflix brought on Night School Studio in September 2021.Netflix currently has 31 mobile games in its catalog, which are free of ads and in-app purchases but only available to subscribers.

That includes the Next Games-developed Stranger Things: Puzzle Games, which is based on the platform’s hit show and will soon be exclusive to Netflix.Netflix embarked on its push into video games in 2021 as a way to diversity its streaming offerings as growth stagnates. But just over a year later, fewer than 1% of Netflix’s 221 million users play games on the platform, CNBC reported last month, citing an analysis by Apptopia. The rush to bolster the gaming division comes after the company lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter.Story continuesThe new studio doesn’t yet have a time line for production. “It’s still early days, and we have much more work to do to deliver a great games experience on Netflix,” Rahimi said. “These four studios, each with different strengths and focus areas, will develop games that will suit the diverse tastes of our members.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

""Bear markets with recessions have ended up being deeper and lasting longer than those without a recession, with the average decline being 35%. So I think we will probably end up seeing this bear market bottom around 3,200.""Stovall's prediction would mark another 14% decline in the S&amp;P 500 from current levels. And if hit, that would represent an approximate 33% drop from the Jan. 3, 2022 record high — roughly in line with the long-term averages seen during a recession called out by Stovall.To be sure, the action in the markets are supportive of Stovall's bearish analysis.With rising fears over the path of interest rates, volatile foreign exchange moves and slowing growing economic growth, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are all down by double-digit percentages year to date.

Rahimi joined Netflix in November 2021, after serving as president of games for Scopely; before that, he was SVP and GM of FoxNext.Netflix kicked off its push into gaming last summer and now offers more than two dozen titles in its catalog.

According to Rahimi, the city is “home to some of the best game talent in the world,” and noted that Helsinki also is home to Next Games.“Creating a game can take years, so I’m proud to see how we’re steadily building the foundation of our games studios in our first year, and look forward to sharing what we produce in the coming years,” Rahimi wrote.At Zynga — which was acquired by Take-Two Interactive earlier this year — Lastikka was co-founder and GM of the Zynga Helsinki game development studio, working on “FarmVille 3.” Prior to joining Zynga in January 2017, he was co-founder and GM of the EA Helsinki tracktwenty game studio, responsible for the creation and live service of the “SimCity BuildIt” mobile game.Story continuesBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in October 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in October 202213 Supporting Actors Who Successfully Campaigned for Lead Categories at the Oscars]"

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is PBF Energy (PBF). PBF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 2.90 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 4.92. Over the past 52 weeks, PBF's Forward P/E has been as high as 48.60 and as low as -103.69, with a median of 7.05.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PBF's P/B ratio of 1.03. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.68. Over the past year, PBF's P/B has been as high as 2.09 and as low as 0.55, with a median of 0.93.Finally, we should also recognize that PBF has a P/CF ratio of 2.11. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.11. Over the past 52 weeks, PBF's P/CF has been as high as 7.13 and as low as -12, with a median of 4.07.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Phillips 66 (PSX).

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$227. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Amgen better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Amgen Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Amgen. In total, Lead Independent Director Robert Eckert dumped US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$190m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Amgen Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Amgen is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

UNH and Amgen AMGN.The renewed selling pressure came last week after Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates by another 75 bps. This marks the third consecutive rate hike of 0.75% and pushed the benchmark interest rate to 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. The central bank also signaled that additional large rate hikes were likely at upcoming meetings as it combats inflation that remains near a 40-year high (read: ETFs That Won After Fed Rate Hike).Fed officials now expect the federal funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a full percentage point above the 3.25% to 3.5% projected in June to end 2022. This means that the central bank could approve another three-quarter point hike at its November meeting and then a half-point rate rise in December.

(NYSE: NEM) is the largest precious metals operation traded on the New York Stock Exchange and closely followed as a bellwether for the sector.The stock closed lower by 0.93% Wednesday, tamping down whatever bullishness might have been evident in the sector. Note that Newmont managed to remain above the late August/early September lows and that both the RSI and MACD indicators are in positive divergence mode.Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: GOLD) is the other large mining company widely followed by the precious metals crowd.Story continuesBarrick closed higher by 0.86%, a different kind of look than Newmont’s close after Powell’s announcements. This precious metals stock has a chart showing positive divergences on both the relative strength indicator and with the moving average convergence/divergence indicator.October’s consumer price index and producer price index readings might be the next catalyst for this sector. Expectations about those inflation readings will affect gold and silver stocks until then.Read next: How To Hedge Against Stock Market Losses With A Gold IRACharts: Courtesy of StockChartsSee more from BenzingaHow The FOMC Announcement Affected The Major REITSA Look At Realty Income's Highly Volatile Price ActionDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

It's a life experience I'll never forget.In 32 years of working storms, I've never seen anything like it before or after. For weeks, the crews and I worked long 16-hour days to restore customers' power as quickly as possible.Like countless residents of New Jersey, many PSE&amp;G employees experienced extreme hardship in the weeks after the storm. There were guys whose homes were destroyed who still showed up for work.My own basement was severely flooded. Every night after my long work shifts, I was going home to drain my basement. I kept hoping that by the time I came home the water levels wouldn't be up to the level of my furnace. I don't think I could have made it through that storm without my crew - good people that knew how to make each other laugh, and who always put each other first.As a manager in the storm division, I oversee contractors in my region of Palisades. Typically, there are only 100 contracted lineworkers at a time. During Sandy, that number shot up to over 1,000.Post-storm, substations that had never experienced water were suddenly completely underwater. We quickly realized the nature of the problem was very different from what we were used to. When there's that much water in the station, we have to shut it down completely. It was a huge effort involving cleaning and testing all the equipment before the station can come back online.Because of the massive damage to local infrastructure and landscapes, many roads were inaccessible. We started tracking which roads and highways were closed off so we could get our crews and materials to the areas where they were needed.Things were so bad, we couldn't even get gas. New Jersey is lucky because there are oil refineries in the state. But the post-storm damage was so bad, that some of the refineries shut down. There were long lines at the gas stations, even for the first responders. Throughout the restoration, customers were very understanding, watching how hard we were working day in and day out. They would even bring coffee out to our crews to help keep them going.Story continuesThere were a ton of lessons learned from Sandy. It wasn't something we had dealt with before. In a typical rain storm, flooding is from high volumes of rain above. But in Sandy, the state also experienced an unprecedented ocean surge, which heavily affected stations that were coastal.I don't want any more Sandy's, but it's where we're heading with climate change. After Sandy, we put a lot of work into rebuilding the stations with similar big storms in mind. I was involved in the start of the post-Sandy infrastructure program, Energy Strong. The Energy Strong program was designed to strengthen our electric and gas systems to withstand storms, improve reliability and enhance resiliency. For example, we now have more storm walls for the stations.Nearly 10 years after Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Ida once again tested the stations that had once flooded. Although these stations experienced water surge levels very similar to Sandy, because of our work to raise and rebuild them, they did not go offline. Ida could have put us in a very similar situation as Sandy, and I was proud that it didn't.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)Website: http://www.pseg.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/717424/Rebuilding-and-Reflecting-After-Superstorm-Sandy]"

Macy's is the latest department store looking to fill more than 41,000 seasonal positions. Other discount retailers like Target and Walmart said last week that they plan to hire additional workers as well. We know about 40,000-- and I know for Walmart, that's slightly lower than usual. But I mean, when you look at Target, they're talking about 100,000 employees. So they're really putting all their eggs in these baskets right now at a time when there's already-- like, the jobs are like 2 to 1. So this is an interesting time to be really pushing for more hiring.SEANA SMITH: It is an interesting time. I think it also really tells us about the current economic environment, right? Some of the bigger retailers pulling back on hiring plans. Maybe they don't expect as strong as demand as we have seen in recent years. Macy's, though, coming out, saying, 41,000 they plan to hire. That's largely anything in line with what we had heard from Macy's in prior years. Also important to point out that more than 10,000 of their holiday workers turned into full-time employees last year. So it will be interesting to see whether or not that trend sticks this year.I also want to bring up a huge story in retail today. Amazon's second Prime Day sale, it's going to happen next year. It's the first time that they are holding two of these events in the same year. I think holiday sales, they are expected to grow from last year, although a lot of that has to do with inflation. So Rachelle, it will be interesting to compare the numbers that we'll see next year-- or excuse me, next month or maybe the top products or whatever Amazon decides to publish-- we know they don't always put the exact numbers out there-- and compare that to what we normally see play out on Prime Day in the summer.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it's interesting because when Prime Day was happening in the summer, a lot of people were wondering, are consumers really going to get on board with inflation so high and having so many options? But they had a bumper, a really bumper Prime Day. So they're hammering it right out, moving right into October. It does seem like what would usually be these Thanksgiving holiday sales just creeping up earlier and earlier. I'm not ready for all that holiday shopping while the sun is still out, and the weather is still nice. So I will probably still take a peek, though, because I mean, how can you resist? It's Prime Day.SEANA SMITH: I know. I'm a big Amazon fan, so I certainly probably will be shopping during their October event. But really, they're following suit in terms of just getting on board with all the pent-up excitement around Black Friday, Cyber Monday. They want to join in on more of this holiday fun.]"

M need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 30, 2022 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Macy’s shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Macy’s is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Regional Department Stores industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 48 cents per share to 18 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Macy’s right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

AVAV clinched a contract for the procurement of Switchblade 300 tactical missile systems. The deal was awarded by the U.S. Army Tactical Aviation and Ground Munitions.Valued at $20.6 million, the missile systems are expected to be delivered by July 2023.Significance of Switchblade 300The combat-proven Switchblade 300, with a patented wave-off feature, is the ideal loitering missile for use against beyond-line-of-sight targets. Moreover, due to its backpackable and rapidly deployable from air, sea or ground platform feature, Switchblade 300 delivers increased warfighter lethality with real-time GPS coordinates and video for precise targeting with low collateral effects.Additionally, the Switchblade sensor to shooter combines the superior intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities of AeroVironment’s small unmanned aircraft systems with the precision strike capabilities of the Switchblade loitering missile system.Due to Switchblade 300’s remarkable features, AeroVironment may witness a steady inflow of orders involving the missile. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such contract wins should bolster AVAV’s revenues from the missile line of business.Growth ProspectsThe demand for modernized defense arsenals and ammunition is gaining momentum due to the evolving defense landscape. Hence, the demand for technologically advanced missiles can be expected to increase manifold due to their growing importance in strategic deterrence.Per the reports from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4.9% over the 2022-2027 period. Such growth prospects entail growth opportunities for AeroVironment to capitalize on the increasing demand.Other defense participants that enjoy a strong position in the missile market and stand to benefit from the intensifying demand are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, and subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Story continuesNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. NOC shares have returned 32.4% in the past year.Raytheon Technologies’ RTX Missiles &amp; Defense is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $78.50, up $1.79, or 2.3%.U.S. offshore oil producers said they were keeping an eye on Hurricane Ian's track as the powerful storm shut in about 11% of oil production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as it barrelled toward Florida.The outages may only provide a momentary reprieve for oil prices, said Bob Yawger of Mizuho in New York.""The barrels will come back pretty soon, I would imagine,"" Yawger said, adding that there is a small chance the storm would change paths and force more shut-ins.After shutting some its offshore crude production, BP Plc said the storm didn't pose a threat to its Gulf of Mexico assets and it was redeploying workers to oil platforms.Crude prices had soared after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with Brent in March coming close to its all-time high of $147. Recently, worries about recession, high interest rates and dollar strength have weighed.""Oil is currently under the influence of financial forces,"" said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.The U.S. dollar, which eased from a 20-year high, also helped support oil. A strong dollar makes crude more expensive for buyers using other currencies. [USD/]The oil price drop in recent months has raised speculation that OPEC+ could intervene. Iraq's oil minister on Monday said the group was monitoring prices and did not want a sharp increase or a collapse.Story continues""Only a production cut by OPEC+ can break the negative momentum in the short run,"" said Giovanni Staunovo and Wayne Gordon of Swiss bank UBS.U.S. crude oil in storage rose by about 4.2 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 23, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday.Gasoline inventories fell by about 1 million barrels, while distillate stocks rose by about 438,000 barrels, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The two companies soaring today, up about 12% each, after China has erased its COVID-19 precautions. So Macau is going to be welcoming back tour groups for the first time in nearly three years. And it's also reintroducing an e-visa program that could triple visitation numbers from their August lows.So those customers, which are known as individual visit scheme gamblers, are among the most valuable in Macau, according to David Katz and Jefferies. Katz and Jefferies upgraded both Wynn and Las Vegas today from hold to buy on the news, highlighting potential growth of 90% for revenues at Las Vegas Sands in 2023.And the positive news, guys, really comes after what's been not so great of a year for these two names. Las Vegas Sands just barely above positive on the year after today's positive move, but Wynn still down over 20% on the year to date, Rachelle. I don't know what you make of this move, Rachelle. It seems like there probably should be guaranteed new people coming back here because they haven't been allowed in, so maybe a little bit different than Planet Fitness when we talk about the return from COVID.RACHELLE AKUFFO: For sure. I mean, a lot of people are optimistic. They keep saying when China fully reopens and when-- that's going to lead to a lot more traffic into things like Macau and other gambling hubs and things like that. But it's one of those things where it's a big if. Obviously, the pandemic is not over for everybody.And so a lot of people are wondering, is this going to be like a stop and start? Can we really guarantee, as you said, if you don't have these people guaranteed to come back, have they perhaps gone to other locations? Have they sought other places to gamble? You have, obviously, the rise of online betting. Do you still want people coming in those same big droves, coming to these casinos?But it's a positive start. And certainly, these casino stocks could use the boost. So hopefully, it pans out for them, and the COVID numbers stay low because that's really going to be the key to success here for Macau.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Josh, you mentioned that bullish note there from Jefferies. Also JP Morgan analyst there, Joseph Greff, he was out with a note saying that this news is, quote, ""the first meaningful travel policy enhancing action since the COVID-19 outbreak."" And he was actually saying that Las Vegas Sands, in his view, was best positioned here because it benefits from the return of international visitors in Singapore, as well as Macau. So it will be interesting to see in terms of the number of visitors and how quickly people are willing to return.]"

All the three major benchmarks tumbled on Friday, with the Dow closing below the coveted 30,000-mark for the first time since Jun 17. The blue-chip index was flirting with the bear market territory and had dropped 4% for the week, while the broader S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively, per the Dow Jones Market Data.In fact, the major indexes have now registered their fifth negative week out of the last six-week period. On the other hand, Wall Street’s fear gauge touched its highest levels in months. In the last trading session, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared above 30 for the first time since Jun 21, indicating that wild intraday gyrations are here to stay. After all, VIX has been known for tracking implied volatility in the upcoming 30-day trading period.Nonetheless, fears that Fed’s inflation fight may lead to a possible recession in the near future were primarily responsible for such a brutal bout of selling in recent times. This is because Fed’s aggressive tightening measures to tame high inflation may significantly hamper consumer outlays, increase the cost of borrowing and hold up economic growth.The central bank, recently, increased its benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points for the third straight time to the 3-3.25% range, the highest federal funds rate since early 2008. The Fed has further vowed to hike interest rates to drag down inflation to its target of 2% at best by 2025. Talking about inflation, gas prices have dipped. However, prices of food, housing, rent and vehicles have continued to jack up with little relief in sight (Read More: Big Fed Rate Hike a Boon for These 5 Bank Stocks).From an investment perspective though, investors shouldn’t completely shun equities! Instead, they should invest in risk-adjusted stocks like PepsiCo PEP, Lancaster Colony LANC, Chesapeake Utilities CPK, NextEra Energy NEE and Otter Tail OTTR for steady returns.Story continuesFirstly, these stocks have a low-beta (ranges from 0 to 1) that makes them inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. Secondly, such stocks are dividend payers indicating a better-quality business, which helps them stand market vagaries. To top it off, the stocks are non-cyclical in nature or, in other words, whose activities aren’t allied to the broader market, making them immune to any volatility. Such stocks undoubtedly come from the consumer staples and utility sectors. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

MYGN has been gaining from continuous recovery in testing volumes. The robust revenue contribution from the company’s proprietary myChoiceCDx test is impressive. However, declining sales and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 42.5% compared with the 41.5% decline of the industry and 18.1% plunge of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned molecular diagnostic company has a market capitalization of $1.51 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met on one occasion and missed in one, delivering an average negative surprise of 40%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ2 Upsides: Myriad Genetics exited the second quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Robust performance across the Women’s Health business bodes well. The improvement in pharmacogenomics, tumor profiling and prenatal testing sales are impressive. Within the Mental Health business, the company recorded strong volumes for its GeneSight Psychotropic test, instilling optimism. The gross margin expansion looks encouraging. The strategic partnerships with Intermountain Precision Genomics and Epic Systems Corporation are other advantages.Myriad Genetics, Inc. PriceMyriad Genetics, Inc. PriceMyriad Genetics, Inc. price | Myriad Genetics, Inc. QuoteProduct Volume Rebounds: Myriad Genetics continues to record strong testing volumes from new products. Total test volumes in the second quarter were 260,000, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 9% and exhibiting continued growth in the company’s core business. Tumor profiling test volumes in Oncology for the quarter increased 7% year over year. Pharmacogenomics test volumes in Mental Health rose 39% year over year. Meanwhile, GeneSight volumes in the second quarter were 95,000, setting a record for the test's highest quarterly volumes.myChoiceCDx Progresses Well: Myriad Genetics' progress across the globe with respect to the myChoiceCDx test seems impressive. The company recorded strong revenue growth in the second quarter from companion diagnostics, including significant revenue share from its proprietary myChoiceCDx test. In the quarter under review, the myChoiceCDx saw its highest quarterly volume in the United States to date, up 63% year on year. On a sequential basis, myChoiceCDx quarterly volumes were up 10%.Story continuesDownsidesSales Results Discouraging: Myriad Genetics registered a year-over-year decline in revenues in the second quarter. The top line was impacted by persistent foreign exchange headwinds, raising apprehension. Hereditary Cancer revenues fell 8% year over year, with quarterly volumes dropping 4%.Foreign Exchange Headwinds: Myriad Genetics receives a considerable portion of its revenues and pays a portion of its expenses in foreign currencies. As a result, the company remains at risk of unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.Increasing Competition: Myriad Genetics is facing major competition in its key BRACAnalysis market. The company expects competition to intensify in its current fields with recently observed technological advancements. Other companies may also launch molecular diagnostic tests that may compete with Myriad Genetics’ testing products and services.EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Myriad Genetics’ 2022 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 3 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 revenues is pegged at $694.65 million, suggesting a 4.8% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Shareholders claim that BCS defrauded them with its sale of $17.6 billion more debt than regulators had allowed.Per the complaint, Barclays made “materially false and misleading” assurances in its annual reports that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective.There are claims that BCS overstated profits, and understated operating and “litigation and conduct” expenses by not disclosing the over-issuance in its 2021 earnings releases.The complaint said, “The failure to have controls in place to account for the number of securities issued against the number of securities registered is such an elementary failure of internal control that is so obvious as to be deliberately reckless.”Barclays has not made any comment yet. The bank’s chief executive officer, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, and his predecessor, Jes Staley, are among the defendants.In March 2022, BCS said that it expected to incur an estimated £450-million loss for issuing structured products in excess of what it had registered for sale. The bank revealed that in August 2019, it registered with U.S. regulators for the sale of investment products worth up to $20.8 billion but ended up issuing products worth $36 billion. In July, it increased the oversold amount by $2.4 billion.BCS had offered to buy back the excess securities. On July 28, 2022, it said it had kept £1.59 billion for the over-issuance.On Sep 15, 2022, BCS said that investors submitted claims covering $7 billion of the securities.The current lawsuit seeks damages for Barclays ADR holders from Feb 18, 2021, to Mar 25, 2022.Over the past year, shares of BCS have lost 32.4% compared with the 15.1% decline of the industry.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, BCS carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company broke the rules on outsourcing fund administration services and provided “inaccurate and incomplete information” to the regulators.BNY Mellon Fund Services DAC admitted to the breaches, which took place between July 2013 and December 2019. It was fined €10.78 million ($11.8 million) for 16 regulatory breaches. The penalty was reduced from €15.4 million as the company decided to settle.The Central Bank of Ireland’s director of enforcement, Seana Cunningham, said that BNY Mellon “failed to act with expediency, transparency and openness even once it was aware that there were further issues with its outsourcing arrangements.”This March, Deutsche Bank AG DB agreed to prolongate the term of an existing independent compliance monitor until February 2023, after the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) prosecutors detected that the bank breached the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not timely revealing a misconduct complaint on environmental, social and governance-related information in its asset-management arm, DWS.Deutsche Bank had signed a DPA with the DOJ in 2021.

131,9fcff757-621d-32f4-9874-9620144b161a,MA,2022-09-27,"Inside Bilt Rewards, a loyalty program and credit card for renters",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-bilt-rewards-loyalty-program-100000257.html,1664272800,STORY,['MA'],"[There are a lot of difficulties with renting right now, and as far as logistics go, just getting the payment to the landlord can still be an issue. While some landlords and rental companies have gotten onboard with online payments, many still insist on receiving paper checks.On top of that, even if you pay rent online, you have to make a bank transfer. Sure, you could pay via credit card, but it almost always comes with a significant fee, usually a certain single-digit percentage of your monthly rent.Bilt Rewards says it wants to erase all that frustration. Founded in June 2021, the company says that customers can can pay rent with a credit card and earn points with no fees, and then use those points on travel, local gyms and fitness, credits toward the next rent payment, or even redeem them towards a down payment on a home.Founder Ankur Jain recently shared more with Fortune about what these offerings could mean for the rental market and how they translate to home-ownership.The following interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.Could you share a bit about your professional background before launching Bilt Rewards?My career started by wanting to solve problems I was facing myself. I accidentally started my first company at age 11 after getting a cell phone and growing frustrated by how long it took to text using T9. I learned to code and built a service where you could send a text straight from your web browser or AIM.Out of college, I launched Humin, a contact management app, which sold to Tinder, where I served as vice president of product for a time. But I wanted to do more than help people swipe, and that’s when I left to form Kairos HQ, the venture fund and start-up studio that incubated Bilt Rewards and several other companies focused on making life more accessible and affordable for our generation.My career has always been rooted in solving problems through common sense solutions, and rent was the next issue I was looking to tackle, which led to the creation of Bilt Rewards.Story continuesWhat inspired the launch of Bilt Rewards?Bilt was created to change the renting experience and help renters earn something back on their largest monthly expense. We took inspiration from the loyalty programs of hotels and major airlines, and created a modern version with our own currency for the $600 billion annual rental market. We then formed the Bilt Alliance, a network of more than 2 million apartments across the U.S. in partnership with the biggest property owners and managers, giving them a way to interact with their residents.And in the same way these loyalty programs have their own co-brand credit cards, we created the Bilt Mastercard, so that anyone at any apartment in the country could earn points on rent with no fees.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 22: Ankur Jain attends the Bilt Rewards Launch Party at Equinox Hotel New York at Hudson Yards on June 22, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)Being able to get reward points on rent let alone being able to use that credit toward home-ownership (especially in this competitive housing market) seems almost too good to be true. Could you outline an example case of a renter profile who would be able to make use of all the service Bilt says it offers? The renter who will gain the most from Bilt Rewards is the one who uses our platform to pay rent, where they’ll earn points on every dollar, and takes advantage of our earning structure to build points on bonus categories like travel (double points) and dining (triple points) with the Bilt Mastercard.They can then use their points to travel the world, book fitness classes at the country's top boutique studios, build their art collection, redeem for credits towards rent, or even apply Bilt points towards a downpayment on a future home.We’re always offering promotions for members to earn even more points, and anyone who opens the Bilt App has access to articles and resources from our team of experts on how they can use them.The skyrocketing cost of rent, especially in major cities, has been a hot topic in the public conversation amid inflation and a potential recession. How could Bilt make a difference in the future of the rental market?With the cost of renting at an all-time high, we’re offering renters a chance to get a second life out of money they’re already spending. Our hope is that with Bilt, the act of paying rent now enables their next vacation, workout class, or even a pathway to their future home.And we’re excited to announce that renters are about to have more things to look forward to when we launch our first Rent Day campaign on October 1. Going forward on the first of every month, Bilt will be giving members access to exclusive experiences, events and promotions with our partners like SoulCycle and Virgin Red, plus rent giveaways and double points earnings when using the Bilt Mastercard.We know the thought of rent day is not something that most people look forward to, but our goal is to reinvent the experience of paying rent, making the process easier and even enjoyable for our members.How is the company funded? Is it self-funded or have you reached out to investors? What has the financing process been like?We’ve been lucky to count the majority of our Bilt Alliance real estate partners like The Blackstone Group, Equity Residential, and AvalonBay Communities as investors, as well as our business partners like Wells Fargo, Mastercard, and Kairos HQ, which is really the ideal scenario. When we win, they win, and we are all even more incentivized to work hand-in-hand in making Bilt a success.Looking forward five years, how do you want to Bilt Rewards to grow? What kind of services do you want to add in the future?We are laser-focused on enhancing the renting experience, and making the act of paying your largest monthly expense something that renters can actually look forward to.For now, that means making free rent reporting available to all Bilt members, incentivizing renters by offering them points for renewing their leases or referring a tenant, and also building out the best loyalty program possible to give our members flexibility and access to experiences they may not otherwise have, all just by paying rent.In the future, we’ll look at more ways we can help renters on their journey towards homeownership, and how to support them through that next stage of their housing journey.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"
132,d4dea77a-c335-3002-a1d2-65200854fbac,MA,2022-09-27,Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains as Market Hits Fresh Lows,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blue-chip-stocks-buy-long-222710446.html,1664231230,STORY,"['INTU', 'MA']","[Stocks continue to tumble as Wall Street ramps up selling in response to heightened fears about slowing economic growth. The S&amp;P 500 hit new 52-week lows on Monday. In fact, the benchmark index is now trading at its lowest levels since November 2020, with a recession more likely as the U.S. Federal Reserve and major central banks around the world lift interest rates to fight soaring inflation.The Fed and Jay Powell are poised to do all they can to drag prices down and are willing to cause economic pain to do so. The Fed’s 0.75% hike last week and its efforts in November and December are expected to lift the Fed Funds rate to between 4.25% and 4.5% by the end of 2022.The Fed’s aggressive actions and outlook, coupled with a flight to safety from investors around the globe have sent both the 10-year and the 2-year U.S. Treasuries to levels last seen during the financial crisis. Yields on the 10-year surged to around 3.9% Monday, up from 3.5% at the market’s mid-June lows and 1.6% in early 2022. The 2-year is floating at 4.4%, up from 0.80% at the start of 2022 and 0.30% this time last year.Higher rates impact equities markets in a variety of ways. Elevated yields make safe investments such as bonds more attractive, while lowering what investors are willing to pay for risk in the form of valuation multiples, and more.The higher interest rates have already dramatically cooled off the housing market and crushed growth-focused stocks. Plus, the overall outlook for S&amp;P 500 earnings is already trending heavily in the wrong direction, as higher rates and higher prices cool economic activity and eat into growth and profits.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe fact that substantially lower growth is already showing up in the earnings outlook and interest rates are responding to the Fed’s hawkish stance can be viewed as positives for longer-term investors looking to find solid entry points into strong stocks. Now it is impossible to call a market bottom in real-time and stocks could continue to slide.Story continuesThankfully, investors with long-term horizons shouldn’t be afraid to start small positions in blue-chip stocks amid the economic headwinds. The U.S. will bounce back and economic activity continues even during recessions. And always remember that many people are most excited to buy stocks near the market top and afraid to buy at what turns out, in retrospect, to be the lows.Here are two blue-chip stocks that investors might want to consider adding to their long-term portfolios as the market falls to new 52-week lows.Intuit Inc. INTUIntuit’s growing portfolio includes online tax help giant TurboTax, alongside accounting software, small business money management tools, personal finance offerings, and more. Intuit spent the last several years expanding its portfolio even more through two major acquisitions. INTU bought personal-finance portal Credit Karma in December 2020 and email-marketing standout Mailchimp last November.The addition of Mailchimp, which also provides digital ad services and customer-relationship-management tools, expands Intuit’s reach into brand new pockets of the economy. The diversified portfolio helps Intuit package more offerings to its small and mid-sized business clients and grow its customer base. Intuit now boasts over 100 customers worldwide.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit consistently grew its sales over the last 20+ years, with only two small YoY declines. This run includes sales growth between 11% and 32% over the last seven fiscal years. The firm’s adjusted FY22 earnings (period ended July 31) climbed 22% on 32% stronger sales (24% excluding Mailchimp). INTU’s FY23 and FY24 estimates have held up well since its August 23 release as its management teams remains bullish.Zacks estimates call for Intuit’s sales to climb 14% in FY23 and 13% next year to help lift its adjusted earnings by 16% and 15%, respectively. The growth outlook highlights how crucial Intuit’s portfolio remains in the face of a wide-ranging economic downturn. INTU’s earnings estimates have held up well for it to grab a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuit hasn’t stayed above the selling, which has hit growth-focused firms particularly hard. INTU shares have tumbled 45% below their 2021 peaks. But the stock is still up 175% over the last five years to crush the Zacks Tech sector’s 55% and 575% during the last decade. The heavy selling, mixed with its strong earnings outlook, has recalibrated its valuation in a big way. Intuit is still trading at a significant premium to the tech sector at 42.1X forward 12-month earnings vs. 19.1X. But this puts INTU near its own 10-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit’s tax and other software offerings are set to remain vital during periods of both economic expansion and contraction. The company has a strong balance sheet and pays a dividend, which it recently raised by 15%. INTU also approved another $2 billion in share buybacks to up its current authorization to $3.5 billion. Intuit stock trades 50% below its current Zacks consensus price target. And Wall Street remains extremely bullish on the stock, with 16 of the 17 brokerage recommendations Zacks has accumulated at “Strong Buys.” Therefore, investors might want to consider starting a position in the diversified software stock despite the economic turbulence.Mastercard Incorporated MAMastercardis a consumer and business credit card powerhouse that operates an elaborate backend processing network. On top of its core credit card segment, MA is actively diversifying to help transform the firm into a financial technology titan designed to thrive in a digital payments economy alongside the likes of Block SQ, the big Wall Street banks, and countless upstarts.Some of Mastercard’s newer efforts include cryptocurrency, buy now, pay later offerings, and other endeavors focused on the future of a mostly digital transaction-based economy. Mastercard’s core credit card segment remains strong, with it travel-focused cross-border segment thriving despite economic downturn fears. The company topped our second quarter EPS and sales estimates at the end of July, as “overall consumer spending remained robust.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMastercard provided upbeat guidance at the time because people continue to spend heavily despite 40-year high inflation. It is also vital to remember that higher-income customers account for a large chunk of retail spending, and they are being impacted far less by 8% inflation. In fact, Mastercard managed to up its outlook for FY22 last quarter, with inflationary pressures “yet to significantly impact overall consumer spending.”Mastercard’s 2021 revenue surged 23% to outpace its pre-pandemic totals by $2 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted FY21 earnings climbed 31%. Zacks estimates call for 18% sales expansion in 2022 and over 16% higher revenue in FY23 to reach $25.89 billion. Mastercard’s adjusted EPS are expected to surge 27% this year and another 19% in 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMastercard’s ability to grow its sales and earnings by double the inflation rate is outstanding. And it’s only failed to beat our EPS estimates once in the last five years. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 11% last year and it still has $6.7 billion left on its share current repurchase plan. Mastercard currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and 12 of the 17 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” with three more “Buys,” and two “Holds.”Mastercard shares had held up better than many other growth-heavy stocks in 2022 until they plummeted alongside most of the market in the middle of August. MA shares are down around 20% since August 15 to close regular trading Monday at $290 per share. These levels offer 42% upside to Mastercard’s current Zacks consensus price target.The recent downturn has readjusted Mastercard’s valuation, with MA now trading near its covid lows at 24.2X forward 12-month earnings. MA’s forward P/E marks a 25% discount to its own five-year median and 10% vs. its decade-long median. The stock is trading at these levels even though Mastercard shares are still up 110% over the last five years and 1,800% in the past 15 years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The partnership will likely allow Hamilton Reserve Bank to facilitate safe and secured, and efficient transactions for its clients in more than 100 countries.

The company’s market cap plunged by US$7.8b after price dropped by 5.5% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, sold US$1.8m worth of shares at a price of US$183 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$120. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like QUALCOMM better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does QUALCOMM Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. QUALCOMM insiders own about US$148m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At QUALCOMM Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded QUALCOMM shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the QUALCOMM insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 shouldn't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.Story continuesBut note: QUALCOMM may not be the best stock to buy.

""These four new approvals provide certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer, high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and completely resected stage IIB and IIC melanoma the opportunity to be treated with KEYTRUDA.""Story continues""In Japan, the cancer mortality rate continues to rise annually, and patients are in need of new treatment options – particularly those with breast cancer, which is the most prevalent cancer among women in the country,"" said Kyle Tattle, Representative Director and President, MSD Japan. ""These new approvals for KEYTRUDA are the result of strong collaboration with the MHLW and provide additional treatment options for appropriate patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.""Approval as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment regimen for triple-negative breast cancerThe approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery for patients with hormone receptor-negative and HER2-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 trial, in which KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy before surgery and continued as a single agent after surgery resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in event-free survival (EFS), reducing the risk of disease progression that precludes curative surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy or death by 37% (HR=0.63 [95% CI, 0.48-0.82]; p=0.00031) compared to neoadjuvant placebo in combination with chemotherapy and adjuvant placebo alone after surgery in these patients.The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-522, adverse reactions were observed in 774 patients (98.9%) out of the safety analysis set of 783 patients (including 45/45 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were nausea (63.2%), alopecia (60.2%), anemia (54.8%), neutropenia (46.9%), fatigue (42.1%), diarrhea (30.4%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (26.1%), vomiting (25.5%), asthenia (25.3%), rash (25.0%), constipation (24.0%), decreased neutrophil count (23.6%) and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (20.1%).Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer, which has the highest risk of recurrence within the first five years after diagnosis and is associated with worse outcomes compared to other forms of breast cancer. While some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2, TNBC tests negative for all three. Triple-negative breast cancer is known to be prevalent in Japan, as approximately 15% of patients with breast cancer in Japan are diagnosed with TNBC. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in Japan, with more than 94,000 people diagnosed in 2020.Approval in renal cell carcinomaThe approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with RCC at increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 trial, in which KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% (HR=0.68 [95% CI, 0.53-0.87]; p=0.0010) compared to placebo.The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-564, adverse reactions were observed in 386 patients (79.1%) out of the safety analysis set of 488 patients receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks or 400 mg every six weeks for up to 12 months. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were fatigue (20.3%), pruritus (18.6%), hypothyroidism (17.6%), diarrhea (15.8%), rash (15.0%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2%).Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men than in women. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 25,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 8,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.Approval in advanced cervical cancerThe approval for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer with no prior chemotherapy who are not amenable to curative treatment is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-826 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 33% (HR=0.67 [95% CI, 0.54-0.84]; p=0.0003), and progression-free survival, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.79]; p&lt;0.0001), compared to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in these patients.The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-826, adverse reactions were observed in 298 patients (97.1%) out of the safety analysis set of 307 patients (including 35/35 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks in combination with investigator’s choice of anti-cancer regimens. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were alopecia (55.7%), anemia (48.5%), nausea (33.9%), diarrhea (24.8%), peripheral neuropathy (24.4%), fatigue (22.8%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (22.5%), neutropenia (22.1%) and vomiting (20.5%).Cervical cancer forms in the lower part of the uterus and in the cells lining the cervix. All women are at risk for cervical cancer, and the disease is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 35 to 44. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 12,700 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and nearly 4,200 deaths from the disease in 2020.Expanded indication in the adjuvant treatment of melanomaThe expanded indication for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma after complete resection is based on results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-716 trial, in which KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.46-0.92]; p=0.00658) compared to placebo in these patients. With this expansion, Keytruda is now approved for the adjuvant treatment of resected stage IIB, IIC and stage III melanoma.The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-716, adverse reactions were observed in 400 patients (82.8%) out of the safety analysis set of 483 patients (including 2/2 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were pruritus (24.2%), fatigue (21.1%), diarrhea (18.6%), arthralgia (16.1%), rash (15.7%) and hypothyroidism (15.5%).Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. In Japan, the rates of skin cancer have been rapidly increasing, and it is estimated there were more than 1,500 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and nearly 700 deaths from the disease in Japan in 2020.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

The decline was trigerred by worries about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an energy crisis in Europe and the end of easy money policy globally. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index are in bear market, losing 23% and 31%, respectively, while the Dow Jones in the only of the three main indexes not to have bear market status.The blue-chip index is down 18.6% year to date. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, the proxy version of the Dow Jones Index, has plunged about 17.4%. While most of the stocks in DIA’s portfolio are in red, four stocks have been standing tall so far this year. These include Chevron CVX, Merck &amp; Co. MRK, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Amgen AMGN.The renewed selling pressure came last week after Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates by another 75 bps. This marks the third consecutive rate hike of 0.75% and pushed the benchmark interest rate to 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. The central bank also signaled that additional large rate hikes were likely at upcoming meetings as it combats inflation that remains near a 40-year high (read: ETFs That Won After Fed Rate Hike).Fed officials now expect the federal funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a full percentage point above the 3.25% to 3.5% projected in June to end 2022. This means that the central bank could approve another three-quarter point hike at its November meeting and then a half-point rate rise in December. Economists warned that the rapid tightening would hurt the labor and housing markets, thereby pushing the economy into recession and impacting the stock market.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of DIA.DIA in FocusSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of $26.3 billion and an average daily volume of 3 million shares.

Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Williams Companies with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Williams Companies Williams Companies' Improving ProfitsWilliams Companies has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Williams Companies' EPS soared from US$0.95 to US$1.28, over the last year. That's a fantastic gain of 35%.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. On the one hand, Williams Companies' EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Williams Companies' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Williams Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$36b company like Williams Companies. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$99m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Is Williams Companies Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that Williams Companies has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Williams Companies has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

""There's just no time. It's just produce, produce, produce and find ways to improve your productivity.""A slowing global economy has started to unwind some supply chain shortages that hit manufacturers and contributed to inflation. Demand for shipping and airfreight have softened, chip sales are slowing and used car prices in the United States are falling.But aircraft parts makers are still reeling from deep job cuts undertaken when planes were grounded during the pandemic, a sign of how uneven the supply chain crisis remains.In the United States, aerospace employment is 8.4% below its pre-pandemic level. In the province of Quebec, where Mitchell is located, the industry needs to fill 38,000 jobs in the next decade, according to industry trade group Aero Montreal.Major casting makers like Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Precision Castparts Corp and Pittsburgh-based Howmet Aerospace , which supply Boeing, Airbus and General Electric , are hiring after slashing staffing in 2020.But it takes time to train new hires. Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun warned that labor will remain a bottleneck for the industry for years.""I don't see this getting resolved any time soon,"" Calhoun told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this month.Story continuesThe problem is most acute in the highly labor intensive, hard to automate castings industry. In a recent Jefferies survey, nearly three-fourths of aerospace equipment makers cited castings as the largest source of shortages.Privately-held Mitchell Aerospace is encouraging staff to take overtime, raising wages by 4.75%, and offering workers referral bonuses. It is also trying to hire more women, immigrants and refugees from Ukraine.Some casting suppliers are taking as much as 72 weeks to fill in orders, said David Wireman, a managing director at AlixPartners.Rising interest rates and mounting economic uncertainty are making companies wary about ramping up capacity, given concerns that demand could collapse, he said. ""It is going to be a rocky time for quite a while.""‘IT’S ALL LABOR’Meanwhile, the struggle to find workers is rippling through the supply chain, delaying jet engine and aircraft production at a time when much of the air travel market is booming.Leesta Industries, a Mitchell customer, is also wrestling with delays and quality problems from a different castings producer.When that producer delivers a month late, Montreal-based Leesta, which makes engine and landing gear components, must adjust to meet its own deadlines, said President Ernie Staub.""Your actual lead time of your product has been hurt by a month. You have to be ahead on the rest of your work,"" he said.Raytheon recently said tight supplies of castings has left it operating ""hand-to-mouth,"" warning that delivery of some Pratt &amp; Whitney large commercial engines might slip into the first quarter of 2023. The company did not specify the previous timeline for the deliveries.Rival GE said supply shortages have made it harder to deliver engines on time.Their customers are feeling the pinch. Airbus' production target has declined, while Boeing warned supply chain pressures have capped its ability to ramp up output.Mitchell's Montreal factory starts humming before sunrise with workers in protective gear filling mold sections with a mix of fine sand and a bonding agent. The whirring and grinding stops by mid-afternoon with no workers for a second shift.""It's all labor,"" said Alonso, who is looking for shop workers and metallurgists. ""We have the demand.""Mitchell can only pass on about half of its higher costs to customers. Automating a part of Mitchell's sand casting production by next year could address some labor issues, higher costs and allow for growth, Alonso said.He sees robots replacing a job in which a worker must remove debris from castings. The work is repetitive and the part is at risk of damage in the process.""We haven't pulled the trigger on the investment yet,"" Alonso said, ""but it's a necessity.""

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Embraer has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Northrop Grumman has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ERJ likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NOC has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ERJ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.79, while NOC has a forward P/E of 19.34.

RTX recently secured a contract involving Dual Band Radar (DBR). The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C has provided the award.Details of the DealValued at $160.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms, Raytheon will offer design agent and technical engineering efforts to support the DBR systems installed aboard CVN-78 and DDG-1000 class ships. The contract includes options, which on being exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the deal to $440 million. The major portion of the contract will be executed in Tewksbury, MA.Significance of Dual Band RadarThe DBR program is the first radar system of the U.S. Navy fleet, capable of operating simultaneously on two frequency ranges (S-band and X-band) coordinated by a single-resource manager. It combines the functionality of the X-band AN/SPY-3 Multifunction Radar and the S-band Volume Surveillance Radar (VSR) to provide an unprecedented level of performance and capability to detect as well as track hostile targets.DBR can operate 24x7 during extended missions with an operational availability that is greater than 95%. Additionally, DBR requires no dedicated operator or manned display consoles and is directed by the command and control-level personnel through the Ship Self Defense System, an open-architecture solution that integrates the ship's systems through a single enterprise network.Raytheon’s remarkable features that can effectively assist in military operations have resulted in a steady inflow of orders involving the radar system. The latest contract win is an example of that. This, in turn, will boost RTX’s revenues from the radars arena.ProspectsNations are strengthening their defense capabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions. In this context, demand for an effective radar system, which boasts the features of next-generation technology-based warfare capabilities, has been gaining momentum due to the system’s growing importance in military surveillance.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military radars market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.5% during the 2022-2031 period. This exhibits strong growth prospects for Raytheon Technologies, which boasts a product portfolio consisting of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars and air dominance radars. Such diversity in radar system technology tends to provide Raytheon a competitive edge in the military radar system market.The aforementioned growth prospects should also benefit other radar-manufacturing defense majors.

""And part of this is really about the forward 2023 purchasing behavior in the wholesale channel. Remember, Nike still has about 55% of its business in the wholesale channel even though they're making great strides in moving to direct-to-consumer. So that's sort of the crux in the near-to-medium term.""Longtime Morgan Stanley retail analyst Kimberly Greenberger added insight on Nike pre-earnings in a recent note:Price Target: $129 (lowered from $149)Rating: Overweight (reiterated)Stock price movement assumed: +37%The ""whisper numbers"" on Nike's first quarter earnings may not be low enough, Greenberger hints — meaning many investors may be surprised negatively by the company's report and guidance.""Taken together, we anticipate [selling, general, and administrative] conservatism and a stronger China bounce back are enough to offset North America/Europe weakness and gross margin pressure, enabling Nike to deliver $0.90 in 1Q23 EPS, roughly in-line with consensus at $0.92. And while Street sales/gross margin forecasts may prove optimistic, our investor conversations indicate the market is similarly anticipating softer 1Q23 revenue and gross margin trends, but in-line EPS. So the stock is likely already priced for this outcome.""Story continuesInvestors should expect a guidance warning from Nike, Greenberger's analysis suggests.""To us, all of this increases the likelihood that Nike cuts its fiscal year guidance, and we subsequently trim our FY 2023 EPS forecast to $3.35 from $3.46 prior, at the low end of Nike's prior implied EPS guidance range (~$3.35-3.65). However, we caution that even our 10%-below-consensus EPS forecast does not contemplate a recession, and thus we see risk for further downside should a recession materialize in North America/Europe. Put simply, we see room Nike guides to an EPS outcome even below our revised $3.35 forecast. As it relates to positioning, investor guidance expectations appear mixed – some are braced for a cut (to ~$3.30 level, a touch below us), while others think Nike could reiterate prior guidance. This could lead to divergent stock reaction outcomes.""Jesse Winker #27 of the Seattle Mariners adjusts his bat while wearing Nike gloves during the fifth inning against the San Diego Padres at T-Mobile Park on September 14, 2022 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)Nike's troubles could continue into next year.""Based on the worsening macro backdrop/outlook, retail second quarter earnings results/mostly lowered fiscal year guides, our recent sportswear channel checks, as well as intra-quarter conversations with some of Nike's wholesale peers, we fear potential 1Q23 demand softness &amp; higher promotional/discounting activity continues through at least calendar year end, and potentially into next year (depending on the inventory clean-up trajectory).""Greenberger still likes Nike stock longer-term.""Nike is in the early innings of transition from a wholesaler to a direct-to-consumer brand. Success would make it one of few to benefit from the shift to eCommerce (~20% of ‘21 sales). Its direct-to-consumer business (~37% of 2021 sales) is igniting its next phase of margin-accretive revenue growth, driving a high-teens five-year EPS compound annual growth rate. Nike also stands to benefit from advancing global consumer activewear demand (due to the work-from-home induced preference for comfort oriented apparel/footwear and increased focus on health and wellness)▪ Nike's strategic portfolio decisions, tech investments, and supply chain innovation also create long-term competitive advantages, and are further supported by an industry-leading balance sheet.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Notably, more public comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell and other Fed members. We also have a few notable earnings on the calendar as well, including Nike. Let's dive into the week ahead with Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova. Alexandra.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, guys, the earnings season will kick off in full force next month, but we do still have some headliners on tap for the week ahead, including Nike, all of which could be an indicator of what's to come, as companies begin to report on a broader scale.Now, with Nike, the themes to watch on Thursday are the impact of inflation and macroeconomic headwinds on their margins, a potential downward outlook revision, and inventories that are expected to remain high. Cowen, which recently trimmed its price target on Nike, said that it expects lower growth estimates from the company, citing a strengthening US dollar and those bloated inventories.We'll also have earnings from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. That is going to be a big one after the quarter that they have had. Micron and Rite Aid are also set to report. And October is going to start a very consequential earnings season because Wall Street is just starting to slash its EPS estimates, as companies start to face pressure from inflation and rates. We're also seeing the most companies citing the word ""recession"" on their earnings calls since at least 2010. That's according to FactSet.BRAD SMITH: All right, we're going to be watching those earnings. What else are we keeping close tabs on this week?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, the week ahead is all about just how bad the selloff can get. All eyes are on the S&amp;P 500, as it appears to retest that June 16 low amid mounting worries that the Fed might over tighten and tip the economy into recession, and now also turmoil and currency markets adding to that pressure. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson just said that a Fed pivot is undeniably off of the table and saying his team remains highly convicted that the bear market in stocks won't end until the S&amp;P 500 reaches a range of 3,000 to 3,400.Story continuesIt's also a busy week for Fed speak, with a lot of central bankers scheduled to deliver public remarks. And investors will have a hefty docket of economic releases. We have PC inflation on tap. We have durable goods orders, new home sales, consumer confidence, and a third estimate on GDP.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, no disrespect to Mike Wilson, friend of the show. I'm really excited for that Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond earnings report. It's going to be--ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: It's going to be an interesting one for you.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes, indeed, it is.

176,73a26739-725e-3db7-bfca-0394b896f0be,NKE,2022-09-27,Nike earnings: 6 warning signs to watch,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nike-earnings-6-warning-signs-140638321.html,1664201198,VIDEO,['NKE'],"[Yahoo Finance Live’s Brian Sozzi provides his take on Nike.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: Welcome back, everyone. Nike is set to report earnings on Thursday after the market closed. And the report could be ugly, says Brian Sozzi. That's where we find his hot take today. Sozz goes into the swoosh. Tell us why.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, Nike's out-- earnings out on Thursday after the close. Of course, a bellwether company in Nike, and very much in the same breath as FedEx when they reported last week. But I think the market-- while the stock is down about 12% over the past month into this report, I still don't think the market investors understand what we might hear from Nike when they report. We're still-- I think a lot of folks in the Street are positioned for Nike to just report something in line and reaffirm their guidance.But here are a couple of reasons why none of that might be the case and the tone might be more negative than investors think. First up, bloated retail inventories. Good note out of Jefferies this morning. Just look at how high inventories continue to be in retail. That note out today. And really reaffirmed to me that it's gonna take a while for these retailers to work through inventory. And when we say inventory, that of course, includes Nike sneakers.Also discounting-- because of those high inventory levels, discounting is intensify to-- is intensifying to clear those inventories. You're seeing discounts pick up at Macy's, Foot Locker, you name it, as these companies try to clear through the stuff through-- before the holiday season.Also, ignore foreign exchange headwinds at your own risk. A company like Nike, over 60% of their business is, in fact, done internationally. And that is not good-- not a good place to be in when you're seeing the dollar trade near a 20-year high.To that end, China is weak, too. We're starting to see some weakness-- some sales weakness at retailers coming out of China. Nike is a key player in that China retail market.Story continuesFifth, volatile stock market equals more cautious shoppers this fall. I think this actually started to play out in the second quarter. That's why you saw inventories really start to back up.And then lastly, Nike could cut its guidance. They're looking for a low double-digit percentage change in revenue, excluding the impact of currency, for the next 12 months or their current fiscal year. That could come down given all those factors I outlined here today.And a good-- just a good comment by Morgan Stanley's longtime retail Analyst Kimberly Greenberger. She likes the name. She likes Nike longer term. And she sees valuation as fair. But she's looking for more visibility into what the back half of the year might look like for Nike. That back half of the year may not look good when that earnings call gets conveyed in a couple of days.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it's a brand that certainly is looking to sell about 65% of its inventory at full price. And then you factor in the inventory that's going out to wholesalers as well and how much their deep discounting and promotional schedules are gonna look over the course of this holiday season, too.And so I think at the end of the day, it really is gonna come down to not just how much the percentage of items that they're selling at full price, but how they're working through the inventory that's out there, has continued to be a headache for the entire retail industry. You're looking at some of those competitors, too. Not once within a retail earnings report this season or this most recent season, have we not heard about inventory struggles. Conor has been absolutely going ham--BRIAN SOZZI: Our inventory man.BRAD SMITH: --on the full-screen graphic and having to update that every single time. So that is, once again, gonna be in focus here.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, speaking of graphics, fire up are the take for today, ahead of these Nike earnings. And there it is. It is-- wow, that's impressive work by the team right there. Don't try and dunk in the face of an angry bear.And look, if Nike comes out here beats by a penny or two and reiterates their full year guidance, I'm sure the stock's gonna go up. And you will have probably time to go out there and chase that name. There is no sense in trying to be a hero and getting involved with Nike.Let's hear what they have to say. Let's see what they're guidance sounds like. Let's see what the tone is from CEO John Donahoe because this would be his first recession, if we do get one. It would be his first recession leading Nike since he took over the company.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and of course for Nike, at this juncture, too. I mean, it's retaining market share. But also within China, as we discussed last week in our bull-bear debate on Nike, it's how they're going up against some of the homegrown brands that are in China, where there's clearly this shift that has been emanating a little bit and the consumer appetite to support some of those brands as well.BRIAN SOZZI: No way you got those Nike's on sale. Those look expensive. They look expensive.BRAD SMITH: Look, I got-- I'm just glad I got them at retail and not resale. That was the goal with these ones, so.BRIAN SOZZI: Those are nice. Those are really nice.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, thanks.]"

The bank recommends investing in Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and divesting from V.F. Corp. (NYSE:VFC).The analysis is based on technical levels but lacks fundamental justification for the bearish outlook on V.F. Corp. in my opinion. Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to study the trade in further depth. Here's my take.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with CMG. Click here to check it out. CMG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CMGPeter Lynch Chart of CMGChipotleFundamentally, I agree it would make sense to recommend Chipotle as an investment in the current market climate. As a consumer restaurant stock, it's likely to hold firm during economic turmoil whenever more cyclical stocks wane; as such, many market participants could shift their weight into an asset such as Chipotle instead of divesting from the market.Furthermore, Chipotle's U.S. restaurants showcased 6% growth in August, suggesting that despite softening global consumption, food consumption at its locations remains firm.Resilient industry support is conveyed by Chipotle's second-quarter earnings report, in which the company beat analysts' earnings target by 26 cents per share. Chipotle revealed impressive same-restaurant sales growth during the quarter (10.1% year-over-year) and appetizing in-restaurant sales growth of 35.9%.Chipotle's stock is overvalued based on key valuation metrics such as its price-sales ratio and discounted cash flow model. However, Chipotle's return on equity of 34.15% and its 26.2% Ebitda compound annual growth rate more than outweigh valuation-based pessimism.Oppenheimer Recommends Chipotle, Warns Against V.F. CorpV.F. CorpOn the other end of the spectrum is V.F. Corp., a consumer cyclical stock exposed to the fashion industry. Consumer cyclicals are very sensitive to the economic environment, posing a risk to investors in the current economic climate.Story continuesFurthermore, the company recently missed its first-quarter earnings target by 5 cents per share amid softening demand for key product lines, namely Vans (down 7% year-over-year) and Dickies (down 15% year-over-year).Despite being plagued with various systemic challenges, the company's gross profit margin remains robust at 54.04%, indicating that economies of scale have been achieved. Therefore, it's likely that V.F. Corp has bargaining power over its suppliers, providing it with valuable operational leverage. In addition, V.F. Corp. delivers a sound return on common equity ratio of 28.91%, providing good residual value to its shareholder base.Oppenheimer Recommends Chipotle, Warns Against V.F. CorpLastly, GuruFocus' valuation box reveals that V.F. Corp. is undervalued, with the stock's price-earnings ratio being the primary driver. The GF Value chart rates the stock as significantly undervalued.Oppenheimer Recommends Chipotle, Warns Against V.F. CorpConcluding thoughtsFundamentals can justify Oppenheimer's technical call on Chipotle. However, its bearish outlook on V.F. Corp. is questionable in my opinion. To me, V.F. Corp. looks significantly undervalued, and short-term macroeconomic headwinds alone don't provide enough substance to support a long-term bear case.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
178,04503a15-24bd-3d9b-906d-13182f5b22c8,VFC,2022-09-27,7 Retail Stocks to Dump Before the Coming Holiday Sales Slump,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-retail-stocks-dump-coming-155230687.html,1663948350,STORY,"['BBBY', 'BURL', 'NKE', 'GPS', 'ROST', 'VFC']","[Usually, the winter season brings levity to people as the holidays approach, but the chilly economic nature this year brings up the uncomfortable topic of retail stocks to sell. Fundamentally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that his top priority is controlling inflation. What’s more, Powell made good on his statements, with the central bank raising the benchmark interest rate.Moving forward, it’s not so much about the rate hike itself (up 0.75%) that matters. Instead, it’s all about intentions. Essentially, the Fed will do whatever it takes to get inflation under control. If that means constantly raising rates until the target is achieved, that is what will happen. Naturally, stocks to sell became a hot topic — and not just for the retail segment.However, retail does garner a disproportionate amount of the negative spotlight because people can always cut back on discretionary spending. Therefore, investors will want to be extra cautious about the following stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNKENike$96.36ADDYYAdidas$63.64BURLBurlington$120.71GPSGap$8.49ROSTRoss Stores$84.68VFCVF Corp$35.99BBBYBed Bath &amp; Beyond$6.72Nike (NKE)a stack of red Nike shoe boxesSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.comAn iconic American athletic apparel and equipment manufacturer, Nike (NYSE:NKE) enjoyed a substantial rise higher following the spring doldrums of 2020. However, shares hit a peak in November 2021, coincidentally at the same time that the cryptocurrency sector hit a wall. No, neither NKE nor digital assets have much to do with each other. However, with risk-on sentiment fading, Nike dropped badly just like cryptos.Investors don’t need to do much digging to understand why some folks peg the apparel giant as one of the stocks to sell. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis through Sept. 22, shares plunged 40%. Additionally, near-term dynamics don’t seem to bode well for NKE, dipping 11% in the trailing month.Story continuesFinancially, the company’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 earnings report presented some warning signs. Revenue came in at $12.2 billion, which was about 1% below the year-ago quarter. This performance may reflect that consumer sentiment for discretionary items (like sportswear) peaked.Adidas (ADDYY)Adidas Sign On Adidas Shoe BoxSource: 2p2play / Shutterstock.comNike’s sworn rival Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) isn’t doing much better, suggesting that investors should consider it one of the stocks to sell. It’s an uncomfortable topic, but all you have to do is to look at the charts. Since the start of this year, ADDYY tanked 55%. Over the trailing month, we’re looking at a loss of 15%.Fundamentally, Adidas faces the challenges associated with transitioning from the pandemic lockdown-related paradigm. As the Washington Post once stated during the initial onslaught of the coronavirus, society incurred a pajama moment. Now, it’s time to go back to work — in the office. As Fortune stated, upper management presently is winning the return-to-office battle.Similar to Nike, Adidas appears to be suffering from peak revenue associated with pandemic-fueled catalysts. In the company’s latest quarterly report, Adidas for the three months ended June 2022 generated revenue of $5.92 billion. This was down 3.3% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.Burlington (BURL)photo of a Burlington coat factory storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBurlington (NYSE:BURL), which formerly operated under the name Burlington Coat Factory, is an American national off-price department store retailer. Fundamentally, you might imagine that such retailers might perform well during inflationary cycles. Those seeking a discount from the erosion of purchasing power own an incentive to seek off-price solutions.However, the market, unfortunately, did not receive the memo. BURL shares slipped more than 57% YTD. What’s worse, the nearer-term picture does not provide room for contrarian encouragement. Over the trailing month, BURL gave up nearly 23% of market value. This performance aligns with other retail-related stocks to sell.As with the two athletic apparel giants above, Burlington may be suffering from peak revenue. In the quarter ended July 2022, the discount apparel retailer generated revenue of $1.99 billion. This figure fell more than 10% against the year-ago level. With the Fed’s Jerome Powell acknowledged that the pivot to hawkish monetary policy may yield a rough landing, it’s better to stay on the sidelines for a company with diminished sales prospects.Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockAkin to other retail segment stocks to sell in the apparel space, Gap (NYSE:GPS) lacks credibility. Fundamentally, the issue stems from a redundancy problem. With so many companies both public and private offering premium-level fashion, it’s tough to compete. Add in the economic challenges and also vagaries and you have a tough situation for Gap stakeholders.Here, the market does most of the talking. Since the January opener, GPS shares slipped nearly 52%. On a trailing month basis, GPS declined by more than 12%. Sadly, it’s not a great look. Moreover, Gap did not make Fintel’s list of the most heavily shorted securities. Awkwardly, then, GPS is bad, but not bad enough to be good — if that makes sense.The other factor that makes Gap one of the stocks to sell is financial performance. For the quarter ended July 2022, the apparel retailer generated revenue of $3.86 billion. This figure came in 8.4% below the year-ago period. Unfortunately, it seems that the company has run out of its post-Covid-19 fuel, making GPS one of the stocks to sell ahead of the holiday season.Ross Stores (ROST)Retail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Ross Stores (ROST)Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comWith Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), I can go either way. It’s true that on a YTD basis, ROST dropped more than 23% of market value. While I don’t want to engage in equities-level whataboutisms, Ross is performing better on a comparative basis than other stocks to sell.Further, the fundamentals of the company present an attractive profile. With many corporate employees potentially headed back to the office, they may need to upgrade their wardrobes. But with economic rumblings, these folks may prefer off-price retailers.Nevertheless, Ross Stores isn’t exactly a shining star. During the trailing half-year period ended July 2022, the company posted revenue of about $8.92 billion. In the year-ago cycle, Ross posted sales of $9.32 billion, reflecting roughly a 4% decline.Put another way, similar to other stocks to sell, Ross appears to have incurred peak revenue. As well, net income in the quarter ended July 2022 suffered a 22% decline. It’s just not in the best of shape heading into the holidays.VF Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comA global apparel and footwear company, VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) might seem like an off-putting idea for stocks to sell. Mainly, that’s because the company features brands like Jansport and The North Face. Both cater to winter sports and, by logical deduction, to a wealthier consumer base. Winter sports simply require more gear than, say, kicking a soccer ball around.Sure enough, VF Corp financially outperforms many other stocks to sell in the broader apparel segment. For the quarter ended June 2022 (actually, July 2 if you want to be precise), VF posted revenue of $2.26 billion. This represents a more than 3% lift from the year-ago quarter.However, the company’s operating income in the most recent quarter came out to $63 million. In sharp contrast, one year prior, VF posted operating income of $203 million. To me, this represents an early sign that even the wealthy may be tightening their wallets.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)bed bath &amp; beyond storefront (BBBY)Source: ShutterstockA retailer of various household goods, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) represents a controversial idea among stocks to sell. Earlier, BBBY garnered attention as a possible meme-trade opportunity. However, that concept came crumbling down.It’s difficult to know where to start with the troubled retailer. In August, much was made about activist investor Ryan Cohen bidding up BBBY call options. Soon after the disclosure, though, Cohen dumped shares, cratering the company’s market value.At the end of August, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond filed to sell shares to raise cash. Of course, the measure represents dilution and, not surprisingly, BBBY cratered again. Shortly thereafter, the company’s CFO passed away under distressing circumstances.I can mention that BBBY stock dropped 53% for the year. I can also mention the financial performance, which is poor and worsening. But then, I would merely be piling on at that point. It’s not a technical term but BBBY has bad juju all over it. I wouldn’t buy it, I wouldn’t short it, I would simply stay away.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -10.4% change. The Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, to which Wells Fargo belongs, has lost 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4 points to a change of -19.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.14 indicates a change of +28.6% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $18.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.6%. The $72.93 billion and $79.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -6.5% and +9.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $17.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16%. EPS of $0.74 for the same period compares with $1.38 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.46 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.47%. The EPS surprise was -3.9%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us with the details. Anjalee, what do we need to know?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, Rachelle, what we do need to keep track of is where we are right now with all these filings. So as we know, right now, Pfizer's booster is available for those 12 and up. It's now adding 5 to 11 years old to its list. Meanwhile, Moderna has already gotten approved for 18 and up. And it has just recently asked for 6 and up in those two different age groups that it has, 6 through 11 and then 12 to 17. And the youngest of the lot is where we still have some information pending, as well as Novavax.So those are the two sort of unknowns right now. But as it stands, the US really set to roll out boosters for the different age groups pretty shortly. The FDA has been going through these pretty quickly, compared to earlier doses and earlier shots in the past. So should hear more on that pretty soon.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, COVID is still lingering, Anjalee. Even the Pfizer CEO testing positive for COVID over the weekend. What are the details there?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, Rachelle, this is Albert Bourla's second round with COVID. And this coming, of course, as we know, Omicron with its infectiousness level. He said in a tweet that he's tested positive, is feeling well and symptom-free. He has not yet had his own new bivalent booster because he-- again, going back to the point where this is his second round, the CDC guidelines recommend that you wait three months before getting your booster. And as well as the fact that he also had Paxlovid the last time. So there are some questions about whether or not he really got some protection while getting that treatment. So really just a real live case scenario at a high level of what the country is dealing with right now.]"

Following the approval, VLA2001 became the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive standard marketing authorization in Europe. The vaccine is also authorized for use in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.The EC’s approval to VLA2001 was based on positive top-line data from the pivotal phase III Cov-Compare study, which evaluated VLA2001 against AstraZeneca’s AZN COVID vaccine, AZD1222. Data from this study demonstrated the superiority of VLA2001 over the AstraZeneca vaccine.The study achieved both co-primary endpoints two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. VLA2001 produced superior neutralizing antibody titer levels to AstraZeneca’s AZD1222. Further, VLA2001 demonstrated the same effectiveness as the AstraZeneca vaccine in neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates by more than 95%.Prior to securing the marketing approval in the EU, VALN also entered into an advance purchase agreement (“APA”) with the EC last year in November to supply up to 60 million doses of VLA2001 to the EU member states once the vaccine is granted marketing authorization.One of the terms of this APA provided the EC with the right to terminate the agreement if VLA2001 does not receive marketing authorization in the EU by Apr 30, 2022. The EC decided to exercise this right in May 2022 and communicated its intent to terminate the APA. Following remediation discussions between the EC and VALN, the former approved an amendment to the APA, revising the supply to 1.25 million doses of VLA2001. The amended APA also allows EC to purchase another 1.25 million doses.Story continuesThis reduced order received from the EC has resulted in management evaluating its COVID-19 program. Though this low order volume does not put pressure on its existing cash resources, the company has suspended manufacturing doses of VLA2001. Earlier this month, Valneva terminated its collaboration with IDT Biologika, its COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing partner. Management is also engaged in active discussions with potential partners on producing an updated version of its COVID-19 vaccine that targets new variants.Apart from VLA2001, Valneva is evaluating other vaccines in its pipeline for Lyme disease and chikungunya.Presently, the company is focused on developing VLA15, its vaccine candidate for Lyme disease. The candidate is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer PFE. Last month, Pfizer and Valneva initiated a phase III study to evaluate VLA15 in individuals aged five years and older. The initiation of the study has also triggered a milestone payment of $25 million payable by Pfizer to Valneva.Earlier this June, Pfizer also bought an 8.1% stake in Valneva for $95 million. Valneva plans to use this money to support its contribution toward developing the vaccine.Last month, Valneva announced that it has started a rolling BLA submission with the FDA, which seeks approval for the use of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine, VLA1553, in adults.If approved, VLA1553 will also be the first vaccine for chikungunya and will be eligible for a priority review voucher. The vaccine has already been granted Breakthrough Designation therapy and Fast Track designations by the FDA.Valneva SE Sponsored ADR Price Valneva SE Sponsored ADR PriceValneva SE Sponsored ADR price | Valneva SE Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderValneva currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Thereafter, a two month-long impressive summer rally raised hope among market participants that the market might have bottomed out. However, the Fed’s tougher-than-expected hawkish monetary stance in the Jackson Hole Symposium last month and its September FOMC meeting destroyed all hopes.Inflation, Rate Hike and Recession ConcernsThe Fed, so far, has been unable to cool down inflation from a 40-year high despite adopting ultra-hawkish monetary stances. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% year to date, unseen since 1990.Moreover, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively. Market participants are now adjusting the cost of an imminent recession in the U.S. economy into stock markets’ valuationAs of Sep 23, our projection has shown that the overall earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to grow 1.1% year over year. This indicates a stiff fall from 8.1% earnings growth year over year estimated in Jun 15. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have tumbled 10.3%, 10.8% and 12.2%, respectively, in the past month.Our Top PicksDespite this grim scenario, a handful of stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days. This means that investors are expecting these companies to do solid business for the rest of 2022, defying macro-economic headwinds.

Each of our picks currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum Corp.

To rev up its electrification drive, it has laid out an ambitious two-year milestone to scale up capacity between 2023 and 2025. It intends to reach a production volume of 1 million EVs in North America and China each by 2025. To ensure that it remains on the trajectory, General Motors is intensively expanding its electrification drive with the planned ramp-up of EV production and EV battery charging networks. It also plans to do away with tailpipe emissions from all its new light-duty vehicles by 2035 and thereby, is developing a supply chain and recycling strategy. Lithion's technology will enable it to recover and reuse raw material in its Ultium battery packs, making the EVs more sustainable and economical.GM’s launch of Ultium Charge 360, aimed at improving the charging experience, has garnered considerable attention.  GM has formed a joint venture, Ultium Cells, with LG Energy Solution. Together, the companies are heavily investing in battery cell manufacturing in the United States. In August, the venture opened its first U.S. battery cell plant, with two plants underway.Moreover, recently GM secured binding agreements for a long-term supply of lithium from Livent and cathode materials from LG Chem to realize its goal of 1 million EVs, securing all its battery raw materials to reach annual planned capacity in 2025, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and full cathode active material supply. As the company moves forward, it will work to increasingly localize its battery materials supply chain to North America.Per the agreement with LG Chem, the company will supply GM with 968,000 tons of cathode material between now and 2030, sufficient to build 5 million EVs. The agreement with Livent will provide significant quantities of lithium for high-performance EVs. Lastly, POSCO Chemical will provide a near-term supply of Cathode Active Material from its South Korean operations between 2023 and 2025.Shares of General Motors have lost 33.3% in the past year compared with its industry’s 12.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.Some better-ranked players in the auto space include Yamaha Motor Co.

198,256dbb6d-25fa-4268-b066-f8a2e69234c5,UAL,2022-09-27,Biden moves to crack down on hidden airline fees: 'You should know the full cost',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-proposes-new-rules-airline-fees-220003922.html,1664229603,STORY,"['ALK', 'HA', 'AAL', 'DAL', 'UAL', 'JBLU', 'LUV']","[On Monday, the Biden administration announced plans to go after airlines and travel websites if they try to slip in fees after you've picked your flight or even after you’ve bought the ticket.The proposed rule is part of Biden’s overall competition efforts and now will undergo a 60-day review and public comment period before it can be enacted. President Biden touted the efforts to pressure airlines into changing their policies during a White House event on Monday afternoon.The overall effort — part of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s recent promise to make flying less painful — comes as other key issues such as constant flight cancellations and an ongoing pilot shortage elude quick fixes.""You should know the full cost of your ticket, right when you are comparison shopping to begin with so you can pick the ticket that actually is the best deal for you,"" Biden said Monday.President Joe Biden speaks during the third meeting of the White House Competition Council in the State Dining Room of the White House on September 26. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)The new rules would apply to extra charges such as baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees. They'll also apply to family seating fees that, much to flyers' chagrin, can be tacked onto fares during the last step of the booking process or after the ticket has been purchased — often significantly driving up the price.‘Help travelers make informed decisions’Under the proposed rule, customers searching online would see the fees the first time an airfare is displayed and potential fees for extras such as flight changes and baggage would also need to be shown immediately. The new rule would apply to flights inside the US and those that take off or land in the US.“Airline passengers deserve to know the full, true cost of their flights before they buy a ticket,” Buttigieg said in a statement, adding that the new rules “will help travelers make informed decisions and save money.”A trade group representing major US air carriers, Airlines for America, told Yahoo Finance in a statement that its airlines are already ""committed to providing the highest quality of service, which includes clarity regarding prices, fees and ticket terms.” The statement added: “Passenger carriers provide details regarding the breakdown of airfares on their websites, providing consumers clarity regarding the total cost of a ticket.”Story continuesThe group represents major airlines American (AAL), United (UAL), Delta (DAL), Southwest (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU), Hawaiian (HA), and Alaska (ALK).Monday's move is the latest from the Biden administration to try to improve the flying experience, at least on the margins. Recent efforts have included a new ""Airline Customer Service Dashboard"" as well as dediicating $1 billion to upgrade America’s airport terminals.Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg testifies before Congress in July. (REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger)'Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism'Nonetheless, the more deeply rooted problems such as a shortage of pilots and the related wave of cancellations earlier this summer haven’t proven as open to administration solutions.The Transportation Department is in the midst of a 90-day review process for another new rule around the issue of getting refunds in the event of flight cancellations. The administration is also pursuing enforcement actions against 10 airlines for extreme delays in providing refunds.On Monday, Biden said his administration's efforts were having an effect. “They cancel on you and you have to pay a fee to rebook. C’mon man,” he said. ""It’s simply not fair.""Airlines for America also also said Monday that its members “offer a range of options — including fully refundable fares — to increase accessibility to air travel and to help customers make ticket selections that best fit their needs.”In a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview, Melius Research Director Conor Cunningham noted that some of the overall pressures on flyers could be easing, while acknowledging delays are still a problem. Still, he added, ""Delays are better than cancellations, though obviously not great, but we're moving in the right direction, I guess.""Monday’s announcement came out of the third meeting of Biden’s White House Competition Council, whose members include Buttigieg, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and others. The group has the ambitious mandate of fostering competition across the economy from finance to health care to technology to transportation.Its efforts were also cast by the White House this week as an effort to also bring down costs in the face of inflation. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the average American loses up to $5,000 a year “due to lack of competition.”During his remarks Thursday, Biden applauded the Transportation Department’s move and said other agencies would soon do the same in their areas of influence pointing to fees from internet providers , banks, and cellphone companies.""Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation and we're building an economy that works for everyone,"" Biden said during his remarks.Ben Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.]"

(NASDAQ:UAL) drops to US$11b market cap, insiders might rethink their US$5.9m stock purchase earlier this year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-holdings-inc-nasdaq-125202913.html,1664196722,STORY,['UAL'],"[The recent price decline of 12% in United Airlines Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:UAL) stock may have disappointed insiders who bought US$5.9m worth of shares at an average price of US$39.38 in the past 12 months. Insiders buy with the expectation to see their investments rise in value over a period of time. However, recent losses have rendered their above investment worth US$5.0m which is not ideal.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings United Airlines Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Edward Shapiro bought US$2.2m worth of shares at a price of US$45.20 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$33.07 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Edward Shapiro was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.Edward Shapiro purchased 150.00k shares over the year. The average price per share was US$39.38. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesUnited Airlines Holdings Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significantly more insider buying, than insider selling, at United Airlines Holdings. We can see that Independent Director Edward Shapiro paid US$1.8m for shares in the company. On the other hand, insider Gregory Hart netted US$544k by selling. Insiders have spent more buying shares than they have selling, so on balance we think they are are probably optimistic.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that United Airlines Holdings insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$46m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The United Airlines Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest United Airlines Holdings insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with United Airlines Holdings and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The investment will enable Optellum to scale its base, operations, and commercial launches in the UK and USA; accelerate research and development; and expand its platform into personalized therapy decisions by integrating imaging data with molecular data, robotics, and liquid biopsies.This funding round was led by Mercia, with additional investors Intuitive Ventures (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and Black Opal Ventures (New York, NY, USA). Existing investors, including St John's College in the University of Oxford, IQ Capital, and the family office of Sir Martin &amp; Lady Audrey Wood, also participated in this round.Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Approximately 150,000 people in the United States and 1.8 million people worldwide die from lung cancer each year. The current worldwide five-year survival rate is 20 percent, primarily because most patients are diagnosed after symptoms have appeared and the disease has progressed to an advanced stage (Stage III or IV). In contrast, the survival rate for small tumors treated at Stage 1A is up to 90 percent. This disparity highlights a critical need for diagnosis and treatment at the earliest stage possible.Optellum is the leader in AI-enabled lung cancer diagnosis, and the first and only medtech company to attain FDA clearance, CE-MDR in the EU, and UKCA in the UK for its software platform Virtual Nodule Clinic. This first-of-a-kind platform can help physicians identify and track at-risk patients, and optimally diagnose the signs of lung cancer early, so treatment can be started sooner for patients with tumors, and invasive procedures such as biopsies on benign lesions can be minimized.Story continuesJason Pesterfield, CEO at Optellum, said: ""With this strong support and commitment of highly specialized investors, we are positioned to accelerate commercial deployment in both the UK and the United States to expand our installed base. Following years of research and clinical trials that have shown the impact of our software on the diagnosis of at-risk lung nodules, we're focused on expanding patient access to this crucial technology and identifying deadly lung cancer faster in more at-risk people. The funding will also boost our research and development with world-leading institutions and partners to progress further innovation.""Lead investor Mercia brings expertise in software technologies having a significant impact on global health issues and an existing portfolio that includes AI and machine-learning technology.Investment Director at Mercia, Stephen Johnson, said: ""Optellum is the latest in a series of companies to channel research from the UK's world-leading universities into commercially viable products that can make a difference to the provision of medical care. Having observed Optellum achieve great milestones over the years, we are now excited to become part of their success and apply our experience with scaling up software and deep-tech companies to help accelerate Optellum's impact on patient lives across the world.""Intuitive Ventures, the independent venture-capital arm of Intuitive (NASDAQ: ISRG), a world leader in medical robotics, including lung cancer care, was founded in 2020 to accelerate the future of minimally invasive care. The investment team supports Optellum's ambitions to think and move beyond earlier diagnosis into decision support across the treatment pathway, integrating liquid biopsies, molecular tests, and drug therapies.""Lung cancer is an urgent public health crisis and Optellum's groundbreaking approach utilizing AI to accelerate early detection and intervention may fundamentally alter the healthcare community's approach to combating this disease,"" said Oliver Keown, MD, managing director of Intuitive Ventures. ""Optellum is uniquely positioned to align and provide considerable value to patients, providers, and payers alike. Intuitive Ventures is thrilled to provide our full arsenal of financial and strategic support to Optellum as we work towards a world of better outcomes for cancer patients.""Physician-led, female-founded fund Black Opal Ventures has a mission to build better businesses and a better future at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Its expertise in reimbursement and health economics will assist Optellum, which recently announced a New Technology Ambulatory Payment Classification for Medicare patients in the USA.Founder Tara Bishop, MD, commented: ""We value solutions that make medicine more accurate and accessible. The strong validation data that underpins the Optellum solution has demonstrated its ability to make a difference to patients.

214,04503a15-24bd-3d9b-906d-13182f5b22c8,ROST,2022-09-27,7 Retail Stocks to Dump Before the Coming Holiday Sales Slump,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-retail-stocks-dump-coming-155230687.html,1663948350,STORY,"['BBBY', 'BURL', 'NKE', 'GPS', 'ROST', 'VFC']","[Usually, the winter season brings levity to people as the holidays approach, but the chilly economic nature this year brings up the uncomfortable topic of retail stocks to sell. Fundamentally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that his top priority is controlling inflation. What’s more, Powell made good on his statements, with the central bank raising the benchmark interest rate.Moving forward, it’s not so much about the rate hike itself (up 0.75%) that matters. Instead, it’s all about intentions. Essentially, the Fed will do whatever it takes to get inflation under control. If that means constantly raising rates until the target is achieved, that is what will happen. Naturally, stocks to sell became a hot topic — and not just for the retail segment.However, retail does garner a disproportionate amount of the negative spotlight because people can always cut back on discretionary spending. Therefore, investors will want to be extra cautious about the following stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNKENike$96.36ADDYYAdidas$63.64BURLBurlington$120.71GPSGap$8.49ROSTRoss Stores$84.68VFCVF Corp$35.99BBBYBed Bath &amp; Beyond$6.72Nike (NKE)a stack of red Nike shoe boxesSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.comAn iconic American athletic apparel and equipment manufacturer, Nike (NYSE:NKE) enjoyed a substantial rise higher following the spring doldrums of 2020. However, shares hit a peak in November 2021, coincidentally at the same time that the cryptocurrency sector hit a wall. No, neither NKE nor digital assets have much to do with each other. However, with risk-on sentiment fading, Nike dropped badly just like cryptos.Investors don’t need to do much digging to understand why some folks peg the apparel giant as one of the stocks to sell. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis through Sept. 22, shares plunged 40%. Additionally, near-term dynamics don’t seem to bode well for NKE, dipping 11% in the trailing month.Story continuesFinancially, the company’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 earnings report presented some warning signs. Revenue came in at $12.2 billion, which was about 1% below the year-ago quarter. This performance may reflect that consumer sentiment for discretionary items (like sportswear) peaked.Adidas (ADDYY)Adidas Sign On Adidas Shoe BoxSource: 2p2play / Shutterstock.comNike’s sworn rival Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) isn’t doing much better, suggesting that investors should consider it one of the stocks to sell. It’s an uncomfortable topic, but all you have to do is to look at the charts. Since the start of this year, ADDYY tanked 55%. Over the trailing month, we’re looking at a loss of 15%.Fundamentally, Adidas faces the challenges associated with transitioning from the pandemic lockdown-related paradigm. As the Washington Post once stated during the initial onslaught of the coronavirus, society incurred a pajama moment. Now, it’s time to go back to work — in the office. As Fortune stated, upper management presently is winning the return-to-office battle.Similar to Nike, Adidas appears to be suffering from peak revenue associated with pandemic-fueled catalysts. In the company’s latest quarterly report, Adidas for the three months ended June 2022 generated revenue of $5.92 billion. This was down 3.3% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.Burlington (BURL)photo of a Burlington coat factory storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBurlington (NYSE:BURL), which formerly operated under the name Burlington Coat Factory, is an American national off-price department store retailer. Fundamentally, you might imagine that such retailers might perform well during inflationary cycles. Those seeking a discount from the erosion of purchasing power own an incentive to seek off-price solutions.However, the market, unfortunately, did not receive the memo. BURL shares slipped more than 57% YTD. What’s worse, the nearer-term picture does not provide room for contrarian encouragement. Over the trailing month, BURL gave up nearly 23% of market value. This performance aligns with other retail-related stocks to sell.As with the two athletic apparel giants above, Burlington may be suffering from peak revenue. In the quarter ended July 2022, the discount apparel retailer generated revenue of $1.99 billion. This figure fell more than 10% against the year-ago level. With the Fed’s Jerome Powell acknowledged that the pivot to hawkish monetary policy may yield a rough landing, it’s better to stay on the sidelines for a company with diminished sales prospects.Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockAkin to other retail segment stocks to sell in the apparel space, Gap (NYSE:GPS) lacks credibility. Fundamentally, the issue stems from a redundancy problem. With so many companies both public and private offering premium-level fashion, it’s tough to compete. Add in the economic challenges and also vagaries and you have a tough situation for Gap stakeholders.Here, the market does most of the talking. Since the January opener, GPS shares slipped nearly 52%. On a trailing month basis, GPS declined by more than 12%. Sadly, it’s not a great look. Moreover, Gap did not make Fintel’s list of the most heavily shorted securities. Awkwardly, then, GPS is bad, but not bad enough to be good — if that makes sense.The other factor that makes Gap one of the stocks to sell is financial performance. For the quarter ended July 2022, the apparel retailer generated revenue of $3.86 billion. This figure came in 8.4% below the year-ago period. Unfortunately, it seems that the company has run out of its post-Covid-19 fuel, making GPS one of the stocks to sell ahead of the holiday season.Ross Stores (ROST)Retail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Ross Stores (ROST)Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comWith Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), I can go either way. It’s true that on a YTD basis, ROST dropped more than 23% of market value. While I don’t want to engage in equities-level whataboutisms, Ross is performing better on a comparative basis than other stocks to sell.Further, the fundamentals of the company present an attractive profile. With many corporate employees potentially headed back to the office, they may need to upgrade their wardrobes. But with economic rumblings, these folks may prefer off-price retailers.Nevertheless, Ross Stores isn’t exactly a shining star. During the trailing half-year period ended July 2022, the company posted revenue of about $8.92 billion. In the year-ago cycle, Ross posted sales of $9.32 billion, reflecting roughly a 4% decline.Put another way, similar to other stocks to sell, Ross appears to have incurred peak revenue. As well, net income in the quarter ended July 2022 suffered a 22% decline. It’s just not in the best of shape heading into the holidays.VF Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comA global apparel and footwear company, VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) might seem like an off-putting idea for stocks to sell. Mainly, that’s because the company features brands like Jansport and The North Face. Both cater to winter sports and, by logical deduction, to a wealthier consumer base. Winter sports simply require more gear than, say, kicking a soccer ball around.Sure enough, VF Corp financially outperforms many other stocks to sell in the broader apparel segment. For the quarter ended June 2022 (actually, July 2 if you want to be precise), VF posted revenue of $2.26 billion. This represents a more than 3% lift from the year-ago quarter.However, the company’s operating income in the most recent quarter came out to $63 million. In sharp contrast, one year prior, VF posted operating income of $203 million. To me, this represents an early sign that even the wealthy may be tightening their wallets.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)bed bath &amp; beyond storefront (BBBY)Source: ShutterstockA retailer of various household goods, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) represents a controversial idea among stocks to sell. Earlier, BBBY garnered attention as a possible meme-trade opportunity. However, that concept came crumbling down.It’s difficult to know where to start with the troubled retailer. In August, much was made about activist investor Ryan Cohen bidding up BBBY call options. Soon after the disclosure, though, Cohen dumped shares, cratering the company’s market value.At the end of August, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond filed to sell shares to raise cash. Of course, the measure represents dilution and, not surprisingly, BBBY cratered again. Shortly thereafter, the company’s CFO passed away under distressing circumstances.I can mention that BBBY stock dropped 53% for the year. I can also mention the financial performance, which is poor and worsening. But then, I would merely be piling on at that point. It’s not a technical term but BBBY has bad juju all over it. I wouldn’t buy it, I wouldn’t short it, I would simply stay away.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

She has volunteered for many years at our church picnic and found so many other ways to give her time for others.""It's always nice to walk into Regions and see her smiling face. She always thinks of others and will ask how I'm doing and check to see if there is anything she can help me with. Mary Lou is one of the nicest people I know - thoughtful, respectful and compassionate to everyone.""Financial Relationship Consultant Carolyn Simard said these qualities and more are what make Schlueter such a joy to work with and learn from.""As a bank, we're here to grow with our customers and help them build their own families and financial futures,"" said Simard, who celebrated her first anniversary with Regions in August.""Regions is a big part of that in Mascoutah in large part because of Mary Lou,"" she said. ""She's such a pillar in this whole town and has built an incredible foundation of relationships and trust with our customers and the community.""""We're like a little family,"" Schlueter said of her teammates. ""After all, you're with your work people more than with your actual family most of the time. We get to know a lot of things about each other, and we share, and it's just a good day every day.""Schlueter said her most important mission is finding out what customers come to the bank to do so they leave satisfied they succeeded.""For me, being on the frontline for Regions means that I am there right away when the customer walks in the door,"" she said, ""to greet them by name and to guide them to whatever they need and whoever can best help them.""When customers walk out the door here, I want them to feel like we cared about them.""Branch Manager Lamont Sneed still marvels at Schlueter's ability to remember so many names and make every customer feel valued.""It's important we provide outstanding customer service and that is led by Mary Lou,"" Sneed said. ""Her providing an introduction for the different customers with the bankers and building that rapport with customers based on those interactions carries a long way.""‘A true legend of Regions'Because of what Schlueter means to Mascoutah and Regions, Sneed and the branch team decided to honor her as a ""Regions Legend"" in the Mascoutah Homecoming parade - complete with crown, sash and corsage.The parade is part of a weekend-long festival in August that the Mascoutah Improvement Association has used to raise thousands for the town's parks since 1927.""When I heard the association's parade theme this year was legends and lore, I immediately thought of Mary Lou,"" Sneed said. ""She is a true Regions and Mascoutah legend. Everybody in the city knows her.""That was proven again on parade day when, in the back of a truck driven by Al, Schlueter made her ‘Regions Legend' debut down Main Street in Mascoutah and then up Sixth Street to Scheve Park.""Mary Lou!"" many parade watchers called out as she passed by. Two left their chairs for personal hugs and well wishes on the pavement.""I enjoyed being a Regions legend,"" Schlueter said of the experience. ""Some people were wondering and asked me if I was retiring but I said, ‘No, I'm just a legend.'""When people call me ‘legend' I feel old but also honored that they think of me as that.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 43.9%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 12 cents per share compared with a loss of $1.75 reported in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $4.95 billion. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported revenues of $546 million.Factors to NoteCarnival’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the improvement in bookings and a return to full operation. The company stated that more than 90% of its capacity is back in guest cruise operations for third-quarter fiscal 2022.During the fiscal second quarter, the company raised its booking position for the second half of 2022. The company stated that cumulative advanced bookings for the first half of 2023 are at the higher end of historical ranges and increased prices compared with the 2019 levels.The company is also likely to have benefited from fleet expansion efforts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company announced the addition of Costa Toscana, AIDAcosma and Discovery Princess to its fleet of efficient ships. The company stated that the addition of the new ships, coupled with the removal of less efficient ships, is likely to pave the path for a 4% reduction in ship level unit cost in the upcoming periods, thereby enhancing the top and bottom lines.However, high costs might have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s performance. The company’s operations are likely to have been impacted by the uncertainty stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. Geopolitical developments have also pushed fuel curves higher.Due to the war, management has decided to withdraw all activity in Russia (which represents 4.6% of capacity for the remainder of the year). The company anticipates the close-end nature of the deployment change and its inability to find alternatives for the itineraries to disrupt booking patterns for some time.Story continuesCarnival Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCarnival Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCarnival Corporation price-eps-surprise | Carnival Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Carnival this time around.

For those customers who have already made the leap to EVs, the new updates to Reveal enable customers to easily manage their EVs and gas-powered vehicles, increase uptime by seeing their EVs’ charging and battery status information all from one platform, and more.Beginning next month, Verizon Connect Reveal customers in the U.S. and Canada will be able to more effectively support various vehicle types – both gasoline-powered and EVs – in one pane of glass. These enhancements will support all Reveal customers including government, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprise customers who have any combination of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles with OBD-II Standard Protocol. Planning for the implementation of EVs can be evaluated from data and analytics from the Verizon Connect Reveal fleet management software platform. The data the team is able to extract, regarding miles driven, vehicle wear and tear, vehicle tracking and location, utilization and other points, can inform a fleet’s EV planning decisions, including the number of EVs included in the first phase of the rollout and future investments, infrastructure plans for charging, EV maintenance, EV storage and yards, and much more. “EV adoption rates are continuing to grow and by analyzing data for just one month, business owners can be better informed about the introduction of EVs to their fleets,” said Peter Mitchell, senior vice president and general manager, Verizon Connect. “Once they make the decision, the new enhancements for EV in Reveal will support their evolving mixed-fleet management needs.”Story continuesWhat EV fleet managers can expect from the new release:EV icon: Quickly identify which EVs are charging on a live map within Reveal.Mobile app support: Manage people and the fleet with location and status of ICE vehicles, EVs and assets in the Verizon Connect Spotlight app.Charge state: Charging status informs which EVs are actively being charged at any given time.Battery level: Near real-time battery level percentage to identify which EVs in your fleet have the highest/lowest battery level.Report: New EV-specific report that includes charging data.EV Alerts: Configurable alert for EVs experiencing a “Low Battery.”Verizon Connect continues to be recognized for product innovation. In 2021 and 2022 to date, Verizon Connect earned 15 industry awards. The awards highlight the organization and recognize Reveal and Integrated Video driver-facing Dashcam as products that distinguish Verizon Connect from the competition by providing more than just vehicle and asset tracking data. Some of the awards include: IoT Breakthrough Awards’ M2M Vehicle Telematics Solution of the Year, Food Logistics, 2021 Top Software &amp; Technology Providers, New Product or Service of the Year: Automotive, Transportation, Storage, and Logistics for the 6th Annual American Best in Business Awards and TechRadar's Best GPS Tracking Solutions of 2022.Verizon Communications Inc.

Through this initiative, students at Bowie State University, the oldest Historically Black University in Maryland, will have the opportunity to engage with and learn from Kate Spade New York executives and designers.More from WWDLouis Vuitton Spring 2023 Men's Spin-off in Aranya, ChinaFront Row at Tommy Hilfiger RTW Fall 2022Louis Vuitton's '200 Trunks, 200 Visionaries' Exhibit Arrives in L.A.Historically Black colleges and universities were established in the U.S. before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the Black community. There are currently 107 colleges nationwide that are identified by the U.S. Department of Education as HBCUs.Created in 2020, the HBCU Fashion Summit aims to change the art and fashion programs at HBCUs in the U.S. by providing students with expertise from industry insiders. This year’s edition will include “Tenacity Talks” for Bowie State students to gain information from Kate Spade leaders, including chief executive officer and president Liz Fraser, senior vice president of brand concept and strategy Kristin Naiman, senior vice president and head of design, ready-to-wear and lifestyle categories and Tom Mora, and senior vice president and head of design, leather goods and accessories, as well as Tapestry’s chief inclusion and social impact officer, David Casey.Some of the subjects that will be addressed include “How to Build the Bones of a Brand,” “Concept, Print and Color” and “Materials for Accessory Design.” There are also a few more brand-centric ones like “The History of Kate Spade and Tapestry” and “Kate Spade Accessory Design 101.” There will also be a session for “Mental Health and the Fashion Industry.”Story continuesAs part of its three-year commitment to HFR, Tapestry plans to build upon the alliance by ushering in other leaders from its portfolio of brands, including Coach and Stuart Weitzman. Like other major conglomerates and some smaller companies, Tapestry is taking steps to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. In line with that, Tapestry will sponsor Bowie State University’s senior capstone fashion show. In addition, internship opportunities will be offered to students to gain further insights and experience in the fashion industry.In a ranking by HBCU this year, the four top HBCU schools offering fashion programs were: Delaware State University, the University of the District of Columbia, Clark Atlanta University and Cheyney University of Pennsylvania.Tapestry is the latest major player to work with HFR to create more educational and career opportunities for young creatives of color. HFR forged a partnership with Louis Vuitton North America to discover, mentor and showcase emerging talents of color through multiplatform, high-visibility events and customized pipeline programs. Supporting HFR by enhancing young talent has proven to be beneficial for fashion powerhouses like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which was the lead sponsor of HFR’s annual Style Awards earlier this month. During that event, zone president and chief executive officer of the Americas Lanessa Elrod described hosting 75 designers as part of HFR’s Designer Retreat earlier this year, noting their hard-hitting questions and how that gathering was “the most inspiring day.”In February, Tommy Hilfiger announced new efforts to improve diversity in the industry, including a partnership with HFR. In addition, Tommy Hilfiger has another partnership with the Fashion and Race Database that includes an examination of American sportswear through a study of denim, the cotton trade, origins of preppy fashion at HBCUs, among other research topics.Separately, Polo Ralph Lauren launched a capsule collection with two HBCUs — Morehouse College and Spelman College — earlier this year that honored the history and the sartorial traditions of both institutions with an all-Black everything campaign, featuring Black creatives, and students from the schools as models. Beyond being an homage to collegiate style from the ’20s to the ’50s, the initiative highlighted how the influence of Black college students had in setting style trends.]"

That is because the Sep 30, 2022 $80.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Semiconductor - General industry that ranks in the Bottom  28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while 11 have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.35 per share to 74 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

AMN has been gaining on the back of its broad array of services. A solid performance in the second quarter of 2022 and its key buyouts raise optimism regarding the stock. However, healthcare industry regulations and the consolidation of healthcare delivery units are major downsides.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has lost 15% compared with a 35% fall of the industry and a 23.2% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned player in the healthcare total talent services space has a market capitalization of $4.5 billion. The company projects 3.2% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. AMN Healthcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 15.7%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Acquisitions: AMN Healthcare has lately been strengthening its inorganic portfolio through a string of acquisitions, raising our optimism. In May, the company acquired Connetics USA, which expanded its international nurse business beyond contract staffing.The buyouts of Synzi, Stratus Video (now known as AMN Language Services) and b4health are other notable acquisitions of AMN Healthcare.Broad Array of Services: We are upbeat about its business’ gradual evolution beyond traditional healthcare staffing. The company has become a strategic total talent solutions partner for its clients. The company’s suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes Managed Services Programs, vendor management systems (VMS) and medical language interpretation services.AMN Healthcare also displayed strength in digital health capabilities with its AMN Passport and AMN Cares. The company has expanded its scalable VMS solution, enabling a wide array of healthcare facilities to quickly staff and manage their entire range of contingent talent.Strong Q2 Results: AMN Healthcare’s better-than-expected results in second-quarter 2022 buoy our optimism. The company recorded robust performance across each of its core segments, along with a surge in its top and bottom lines in the quarter. Per management, the company witnessed robust demand for staffing and other services, significantly higher than the pre-pandemic levels, raising our optimism. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin also bodes well for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesHealthcare Industry Regulations: The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations. AMN Healthcare provides talent solutions and technologies on a contractual basis to its clients who pay the company directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact the company. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for the company’s services.Consolidation of Healthcare Delivery Units: Healthcare delivery organizations are consolidating, providing them with greater leverage in negotiating pricing for services. Consolidations may also result in AMN Healthcare losing its ability to work with certain clients because the party acquiring or consolidating with its client may have a previously established service provider they opt to maintain.Estimate TrendAMN Healthcare has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2022. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 8.2% north to $11.16.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, suggesting a 24.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.AMN Healthcare Services Inc PriceAMN Healthcare Services Inc PriceAMN Healthcare Services Inc price | AMN Healthcare Services Inc QuoteOther Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Semler Scientific SMLR.

Robust performance across the Women’s Health business bodes well. The improvement in pharmacogenomics, tumor profiling and prenatal testing sales are impressive. Within the Mental Health business, the company recorded strong volumes for its GeneSight Psychotropic test, instilling optimism. The gross margin expansion looks encouraging.

As a result, the company remains at risk of unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.Increasing Competition: Myriad Genetics is facing major competition in its key BRACAnalysis market.

The company is expecting an increase in digital health demand with the adoption of digital healthcare management systems. The stiff competition faced by ResMed is worrying. This apart, reimbursement issues and competitive bidding continue to affect the stock. ResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 23.5% compared with the 51.2% decline of the industry.ResMed exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded robust sales performance on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. Revenue growth across several geographies is impressive. The growing adoption of ResMed’s AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 platforms raises investors’ confidence.The continued uptake of core non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease is encouraging too. The expansion of gross margin seems promising. Increased focus on international markets, a robust product line and strong solvency are added benefits.ResMed Inc. PriceResMed Inc. PriceResMed Inc. price | ResMed Inc. QuoteTo meet the additional demand in relation to a competitor’s recall, the company is working closely with its global supply chain partners to improve access to further supplies of critical components. The company is also reengineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, supplies and speeding up product launches as well as development to keep up with the demand. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company derived incremental revenues in the range of $60-$70 million associated with the competitor’s recall.ResMed continues to see robust demand for a market-leading mask portfolio despite facing challenges related to declining new patient setups from a competitor recall. The company recorded increased masks and other sales in the United States, Canada and the Latin-America region in the fiscal fourth quarter, where growth was 13% on a reported basis, reflecting solid resupply revenues amid a challenging device supply environment. In combined Europe, Asia and other markets, masks and other sales rose 7% at CER. Globally, masks and other sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 11% at CER.Story continuesResMed, during the fiscal fourth quarter, recorded an 11% year-over-year increase in device sales in the United States, Canada and Latin-America region, benefiting from incremental revenues from a competitor's recall. Furthermore, device sales increased 2% year over year and 6% at CER on a global basis. In the reported quarter, the company introduced the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud solution to address the needs of an industry crisis in PAP supply. The company expects the new device, along with the AirSense 11 and its legacy AirSense 10 device to support solid growth throughout fiscal 2023.On the flip side, ResMed did not derive any incremental revenues from COVID-related demand in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. During the quarter, ResMed’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose 7.4% year over year (up 12% at CER) predominantly on increases in employee-related expenses, professional service fees and travel expenses.Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 7.4% (up 11% at CER). These mounting expenses led to an adjusted operating margin contraction of 24 bps year over year to 29.5%, weighing on the company’s bottom line. The persistent supply-chain challenges related to securing sufficient components hamper its ability to meet the growing device demand. The volatility surrounding COVID restrictions across the globe also continue to pose challenges.ResMed's ability to sell its products largely depends on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of its products.In some markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of  products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other markets, such as Australia, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat SDB conditions.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space  are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Robust adoption of the company’s digital health services buoys optimism.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The pharmaceutical, diagnostic and laboratory testing industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing and extensive search for technological innovation. Numerous companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products competitive with those OPKO Health intends to commercialize itself and through its partners.Overdependence on RAYALDEE: OPKO Health’s RAYALDEE is the company’s only pharmaceutical product approved for marketing in the United States. The company’s ability to generate revenues from product sales and achieve profitability is substantially dependent on its ability to effectively commercialize RAYALDEE. The failure to successfully commercialize RAYALDEE would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Estimate TrendOPKO Health is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has widened from a loss of 21 cents per share to a loss of 42 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $177.4 million, suggesting a 54% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 1.8% each. Moreover, the three indices plummeted for a second consecutive week.Factors Behind Bearish SentimentThe prevailing pessimism is attributed to the growing geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the China-Taiwan conflict, which escalated global sanctions and energy crisis in the European Union.The coronavirus pandemic-induced supply-chain constraints, a spike in the COVID-19 cases in China and the resultant strict lockdowns are other downtrends.Most importantly, rising inflationary woes and the resulting interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are major headwinds.To achieve its target of 2% inflation rate, the Fed again announced a 0.75% rate hike on Sep 21, 2022. This marks the fifth rate increase this year and the third consecutive jump of 75 basis points. The annual interest rate is marked at 8.3% for the 12 months ended August 2022, according to the U.S. Labor Department data published on Sep 13, 2022.The constant surge in interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will bear a negative impact on consumer spending. It will also cause a higher unemployment rate and thus slow down economic growth. Notably, the United States recorded two successive quarters of downslide.Safe Investment to Stay AfloatGiven the current turmoil in the market and the growing fears of an incoming recession, investors are panicking to continue investing in the market. Does it mean that there are no sectors to invest in amid this market volatility?To stay safe and avail returns in this unpredictable market condition, investors can pump their resources into the defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care.Story continuesThese sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services, which consumers will continue to access even during an unprecedented economic turmoil.Stocks catering to the defensive sectors are less likely to get affected by the economic turbulence and will thus remain a suitable choice for stable earnings.Defensive stocks also tend to offer high dividend yields, and cater to capital preservation and income generation, thereby emerging as solid picks for investors to diversify their portfolio.Our Top Stock SuggestionsWe recommend four defensive stocks as these are less sensitive to take a hit from an economic downturn. Apart from strong fundamentals, these stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B. Moreover, these companies are regular dividend payers.

(NYSE: TRV) today released its 2022 Travelers Risk Index results, and for the third time in four years, the survey found that cyber threats were the top overall concern for business decision makers. Of the 1,200 survey participants, more feel that today’s business environment is riskier compared to a year ago, and more than half (57%) think a future cyber attack on their company or organization is inevitable.Cyber threats again were the leading concern, but other issues were close behind, a change from 2021 when cyber held the top spot by 6 percentage points. This year, 59% of survey respondents said that they worry some or a great deal about cyber threats, followed closely by broad economic uncertainty (57%), fluctuations in oil and energy costs (56%), the ability to attract and retain talent (56%), and medical cost inflation (55%). Big jumps were seen this year relating to concerns in oil and energy costs (a 16-point increase, up from 40%) and supply chain risks (54%, up from 43%), a nod to current events and the serious obstacles businesses and individuals are facing.""Cyber attacks can shut down a company for a long period of time or even put it out of business, and it’s imperative that companies have a plan in place to mitigate any associated operational and financial disruptions,"" said Tim Francis, Enterprise Cyber Lead at Travelers. ""Effective measures that have proven to reduce the risk of becoming a cyber victim are available, but based on these survey results, not enough companies are taking action. It’s never too late, and these steps can help businesses avoid a devastating cyber event.""Overconfidence in navigating the evolving cyber landscape is causing a false sense of security, with 93% of respondents stating that they were confident their company had implemented best practices to prevent or mitigate a cyber event. But when asked whether their company had taken specific prevention measures, the majority had not: 64% don’t use endpoint detection and response, 59% haven’t conducted a cyber assessment for vendors, and 53% don’t have an incident response plan.Story continuesEven multifactor authentication (MFA) has been slow to catch on. According to this year’s Travelers Risk Index, 90% of survey respondents said they were familiar with MFA, yet only 52% said their company had implemented the practice for remote access. This, despite Microsoft stating that 99.9% of account compromise attacks are blocked by adding the extra security measure of MFA to verify a computer user’s identity, and Arete stating that 94% of ransomware victims weren’t using MFA.Other important survey findings relating to cyber include:The cyber-specific concerns that stayed in the top two spots are: suffering a security breach or someone hacking into a business computer system (57% say they worry some or a great deal) and a system glitch causing a company’s computers to go down (55%). Becoming a cyber extortion/ransomware victim moved from eighth position to third this year at 54%.For the seventh consecutive year, there was an increase in the percentage of survey participants who said their company had suffered a data breach or cyber event. This year, 26% said their company had been a cyber victim, with nearly half of those (49%) reporting that the event had happened within the past 12 months.Of those who said their company had suffered a data breach or cyber event, 71% have been a victim more than once.Nearly 75% of respondents said they believe having a cyber insurance policy is critical, but the percentage who said their company has purchased coverage was 59%, up only 3 points from 2021. Small businesses accounted for the largest increase of cyber policy purchasers, up from 30% to 38% this year.Francis added, ""Multiple cyber attacks might not be random – if you were vulnerable before and don’t take appropriate action as a result, you continue to be at risk. It’s important to take the prospect of a cyber attack seriously and to put your company in position to successfully manage a likely event.""Travelers has long been committed to managing and mitigating cyber risk, with a dedicated team of underwriters, claim professionals and risk control specialists who work to help insure and protect customers’ assets.In recognition of Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October, the Travelers Institute, Travelers’ public policy division, is hosting three complimentary educational programs for the business community and broader public to help increase preparedness. A webinar Oct. 12 will examine new reporting requirements included in recent cybersecurity legislation. In-person programs will also be hosted in St. Paul, Minnesota Oct. 4 and in Los Angeles Oct. 13.

To this end, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) intends to file an application with the National Mediation Board (NMB) soon. NMB is the federal agency responsible for conducting elections pertaining to union representation of airlines and railroads.Per Robert Martinez Jr, the international president of IAM, “I congratulate all JetBlue Ground Operations workers for uniting in solidarity and demanding that a union representation election be conducted. It’s been a long road for these brave workers to get to this point, and the IAM stands shoulder to shoulder with them. We will mobilize our union’s significant resources to ensure that these brave and resilient JetBlue workers have a fair and free election.”We note that JBLU’s ground workers made concerted efforts to get a union representation. IAM representing around 3,000 ground workers at JBLU, believes that the ground-level staff is underpaid and therefore unionization is very important for this category of workforce.Following unionization, AMFA is expected to engage in talks with JBLU for higher pay, better working conditions and other related factors for the ground workers. This is likely to elevate costs at the currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) JBLU, which could have possibly prevented management from taking a decision in favor of unionization.Per a Reuters report, management believes that “the direct relationship we have with our ground operations crewmembers has worked, and will continue to work, and that third-party representation and the costs to our crewmembers that come with it are not in their best interests.""Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks  Transportation  sector are  Triton International  TRTN and  C.H.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Genuine Parts (GPC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 24 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 20, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.05 a share.GPC has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.82%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.05 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03.GPC is part of a big group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cummins (CMI) as well.Cummins is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2022. CMI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.93 a share 36 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cummins is $4.82, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.26%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GPC and CMI could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.11%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.12%.Heading into today, shares of the entertainment company had lost 12.77% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 12.39% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 10.4% in that time.Walt Disney will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Walt Disney to post earnings of $0.64 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 72.97%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $21.24 billion, up 14.62% from the year-ago period.DIS's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.85 per share and revenue of $83.8 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +68.12% and +24.31%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Walt Disney. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.06% lower.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.34.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that DIS has a PEG ratio of 1.3. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Pearson has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Walt Disney has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PSO is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PSO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.68, while DIS has a forward P/E of 25.82. We also note that PSO has a PEG ratio of 0.95. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. DIS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.30.Another notable valuation metric for PSO is its P/B ratio of 1.22. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, DIS has a P/B of 1.88.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PSO's Value grade of B and DIS's Value grade of C.PSO stands above DIS thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PSO is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nasdaq also requested detail on the quantity of shares allocated and the brokerages involved, said Tsang, who has advised on recent US IPOs including Magic Empire Global Ltd. and Top Financial Group.The details follow a Bloomberg News report last week that Nasdaq has increased its oversight following outsized stock price fluctuations at more than a dozen small-cap companies that debuted in the US this year. The stricter checks may add to uncertainty around the timing of several planned IPOs, including Hongli Group Inc., Lichen China Ltd. as well as US-based Alopexx Inc.“The fresh requests from Nasdaq aims at enhancing transparency on placements and connected transactions at IPOs, a lot like what Hong Kong regulators asked for a few years ago,” Tsang said in an interview. “We are optimistic that the deals would eventually go through and successfully list.”A representative from Nasdaq declined to comment.The gap between pricing an IPO and its first trading day is much shorter in the US than in Hong Kong, where there’s typically a five-day lag. In the US, underwriters aren’t routinely asked to submit share allocation details, in part due to the limited time for it to be reviewed.Story continuesIn Hong Kong, the regulator halted some deals in 2017 amid concern there were abnormalities in the share allocations of some small-cap listings that might jeopardize an orderly market open on debut.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisWould You Invest $10,000 in a Friend’s Startup?

Expanding on the foundational work of Mayor Bruce Harrell and the City of Seattle Office of Economic Development to establish regional partnerships that support small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Comcast will award $10,000 cash grants to 100 small business owners.Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell and Tacoma City Council Member Keith Blocker, along with representatives from the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber of Commerce, joined Comcast today at Work and Play Lounge in West Seattle to announce the Comcast RISE Investment Fund. Beginning on October 3 and through October 16, eligible businesses can apply for a $10,000 grant at www.ComcastRISE.com.“Small businesses make our communities vibrant places to live and work, and they have shown tremendous resilience over the last two years,” said Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell. “The Comcast RISE grants will provide a boost for women and BIPOC-owned small businesses in Seattle, investing in an equitable recovery for our city and giving these businesses that make up the very fabric of our communities the tools needed to thrive.”According to a 2022 survey, almost all small businesses (97%) are concerned about inflation, and rising costs are the most significant threats small businesses currently face. Boosting revenue from online sales has become the No. 1 priority for small businesses. Some past Comcast RISE recipients have used their grants to expand their presence online.To offer some relief and help small businesses continue to grow and adapt, Comcast RISE was formed in late 2020 to give small businesses owned by people of color the grants needed not just to survive but thrive. In November 2021, Comcast RISE announced a major expansion to all women-owned businesses nationwide. Also, as early as March 2020, the Seattle Office of Economic Development identified the need to provide SBA disaster loans to local small businesses impacted by COVID and also launched the Small Business Stabilization Fund at that time.Story continuesLast fall, more than 100 small businesses owned by people of color in King and Pierce Counties were awarded $1 million in total grants as well as technology and marketing resources, bringing the total to more than $2 million to date. These recipients are part of the more than 9,500 entrepreneurs nationwide who have been selected as Comcast RISE awardees since the program’s inception. One of the local grant recipients from last year is Margie Haywood, owner of Work and Play Lounge.“As a self-funded business of more than seven years, facing racism, barriers, rejection, and no access to funding like so many others, the Comcast RISE grant came at a pivotal time in my journey. It was the first money from any institution I had ever received. In the reality of the true cost to run a business, it might not have seemed like much to others, but between the award letter and $10,000, it gave me more than just capital to prevent my business from closing,” said Margie Haywood, owner of Work and Play Lounge. “It gave me and my family joy, hope, and confirmation that we are seen and qualify as business owners who deserve to participate in the business ecosystem. I am more confident after winning, that I am making the right decision as an entrepreneur, that when you use business to build community, advocate and invest in others without expectation of return or benefit, much like Comcast Rise Investment Fund is doing in marginalized communities, you will always get a positive return on investment.”The Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan area is among five major metros that also include Chicago, Miami, Oakland, and Washington, D.C., which were selected to award a $10,000 grant to 100 local businesses from the Comcast RISE Investment Fund for a total of $5 million across 500 businesses, bringing the amount awarded nationwide to $21 million to date. Through Comcast RISE, the company also announced it will support 13,000 small businesses, owned by people of color and women with monetary grants; a TV campaign, production of a TV commercial or consulting services from Effectv; or computer equipment, internet, voice, or cybersecurity from Comcast Business by the end of 2022.“Independent small businesses are the backbone of our communities, and Comcast is committed to supporting them,” said Rodrigo Lopez, regional senior vice president, Comcast Washington. “We encourage small business owners to apply for the Comcast RISE program. The grant may cover any need to help your business survive and thrive. We know no single relief effort can solve historic and systemic inequities overnight, but Comcast is committed to taking tangible actions that can drive long-term impact for change.”In addition, Comcast RISE invests in ongoing mentorship and resources to help businesses succeed over the long term. The program has partnered with Ureeka, an online platform for entrepreneurs, to provide grant recipients with business coaching to help build skills in company foundation, growing customers, and financial stability. All Comcast RISE recipients will also have a specialized online networking community within Ureeka with access to educational resources, sources of capital, and vetted experts such as U.S. Black Chambers, National Asian Pacific Islander Chamber of Commerce &amp; Entrepreneurship, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Association for Enterprise Opportunity, Walker’s Legacy and Operation Hope.Comcast RISE Marketing and Technology Services In addition to the Investment Fund, Comcast RISE, which stands for “Representation, Investment, Strength and Empowerment,” provides the opportunity for small businesses owned by people of color and women nationwide to apply for grants for one or more of the following support focus areas with the opportunity to receive one.Marketing Services Grant: The following services from Effectv, the advertising sales division of Comcast Cable, and its creative agency, Mnemonic, are designed to help recipients with their marketing and media campaigns, including:Media: A linear TV media campaign to run over a 90-day period.Creative Production: Turnkey 30-second TV commercial production, plus a media strategy consultation and a 90-day linear TV media campaign.Consult: Digital audits by Ureeka in the form of Website Repair Reports and SEO Keyword reports to target website mechanics and effective organic marketingTechnology Makeover Grants: The state-of-the-art equipment and technology upgrade from Comcast Business includes computer equipment as well as internet, voice, and cybersecurity services for up to a 12-month period. (Taxes and other fees may still apply for tech makeover services.)Monetary Grants: Monetary grants can be used for any business expense. In round one, which was announced in April of 2021, the Comcast RISE Investment Fund provided $5 million in grants to 500 small businesses owned by people of color in five cities: Philadelphia/Chester, Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit. In round two, which was announced in September of 2021, the Comcast RISE Investment Fund provided $6 million in grants to 600 small businesses in six cities: Miami, Houston, Oakland, Seattle, the Twin Cities, and Washington, D.C. In round three, the Comcast RISE Investment Fund provided an additional $5 million in grants to 500 small businesses owned by people of color and women in five cities: Atlanta, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and the Twin Cities.

The department’s No. 2 official, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, is concerned the agreement doesn’t go far enough to keep the data of US users safe from Chinese actors, one of the people said.The news about the pending agreement was reported earlier by the New York Times.A spokesperson for the Treasury Department said Cfius is committed to taking all actions within its authority to safeguard national security, but doesn’t comment on transactions it may be reviewing.“We will not comment on the specifics of confidential discussions with the US government, but we are confident that we are on a path to fully satisfy all reasonable US national security concerns,” a TikTok spokesperson said.Story continuesRegulators and lawmakers have long feared that Chinese authorities could access US user data via TikTok. These anxieties were revived following a report by BuzzFeed in June that US user data had been repeatedly accessed from China.The same day as the BuzzFeed story, TikTok said it was routing all US user traffic through Oracle Corp.’s cloud, and that the database giant is auditing its algorithms. TikTok and Oracle are expected to continue working together on a storage setup that satisfies US national security concerns, according to a person familiar with the process.While TikTok’s one billion active users makes it smaller than some of its social media peers, it’s growing quickly -- particularly among young people. In June, the app was the second-most-likely used app among Gen Z users, trailing behind Instagram in the top spot, according to analysis from data.ai. It’s also swiftly building its ad business, with eMarketer estimating revenue of $12 billion this year, up from $4 billion in 2021.China hawks on Capitol Hill are expected to criticize any agreement that stops short of forcing the sale of the platform to a US company. Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week urging her to require TikTok to sever all ties with Chinese companies and to force ByteDance to divest itself from TikTok.Hawley hasn’t yet received a response from the department, though Treasury has acknowledged receipt, according to Philip Letsou, Hawley’s communications director.Former President Donald Trump stopped short of banning the app in an effort to broker a deal to sell the platform to a US buyer, which never came to fruition. ByteDance had sought US approval to sell a stake in the app to Oracle and Walmart Inc., but the transaction didn’t materialize. Efforts by the Trump administration to boot TikTok from the Apple and Google app stores were blocked by a US court.A top TikTok executive told senators this month that the company is negotiating with US officials on restricting access to US data for employees in China but declined to commit to a total cutoff.As the Cfius review process continues, the administration is weighing other action, including by the Commerce Department, which is considering a rule that would give the Commerce Secretary more oversight over apps owned by foreign adversaries. If enacted, the rule change would empower the Commerce Department to force TikTok to undergo third-party audits -- or even restrict the app in the US.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

TikTok would store its American data solely on servers in the U.S., probably run by Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL). Second, Oracle will likely monitor TikTok's powerful algorithms that determine the content the app recommends. Lastly, TikTok would create a board of security experts reporting to the government to oversee its U.S. operations.TikTok struggled to keep operating in the U.S. without significant changes to its ownership structure.The Justice Department led the negotiations with TikTok reserving concerns over China. The Treasury Department expressed doubt over the resolution of national security issues.U.S. lawmakers and regulators repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's ability to protect the data of U.S. users from China. Former U.S. President Donald J. Trump tried to force ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. company in 2020 and threatened to block the app.The White House worked on two other executive orders to address concerns about China. One would tackle worries that American investors were putting money into Chinese firms. The second could give the government more power to take on apps that, like TikTok, could leak data to a foreign power.Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) and TikTok were the only platforms to see year-over-year growth in Q3.

Notably, more public comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell and other Fed members. We also have a few notable earnings on the calendar as well, including Nike. Let's dive into the week ahead with Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova. Alexandra.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, guys, the earnings season will kick off in full force next month, but we do still have some headliners on tap for the week ahead, including Nike, all of which could be an indicator of what's to come, as companies begin to report on a broader scale.Now, with Nike, the themes to watch on Thursday are the impact of inflation and macroeconomic headwinds on their margins, a potential downward outlook revision, and inventories that are expected to remain high. Cowen, which recently trimmed its price target on Nike, said that it expects lower growth estimates from the company, citing a strengthening US dollar and those bloated inventories.We'll also have earnings from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. That is going to be a big one after the quarter that they have had. Micron and Rite Aid are also set to report. And October is going to start a very consequential earnings season because Wall Street is just starting to slash its EPS estimates, as companies start to face pressure from inflation and rates. We're also seeing the most companies citing the word ""recession"" on their earnings calls since at least 2010. That's according to FactSet.BRAD SMITH: All right, we're going to be watching those earnings. What else are we keeping close tabs on this week?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, the week ahead is all about just how bad the selloff can get. All eyes are on the S&amp;P 500, as it appears to retest that June 16 low amid mounting worries that the Fed might over tighten and tip the economy into recession, and now also turmoil and currency markets adding to that pressure. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson just said that a Fed pivot is undeniably off of the table and saying his team remains highly convicted that the bear market in stocks won't end until the S&amp;P 500 reaches a range of 3,000 to 3,400.Story continuesIt's also a busy week for Fed speak, with a lot of central bankers scheduled to deliver public remarks. And investors will have a hefty docket of economic releases. We have PC inflation on tap. We have durable goods orders, new home sales, consumer confidence, and a third estimate on GDP.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, no disrespect to Mike Wilson, friend of the show.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly earnings stands at $1.42 per share and has been revised downward by a couple of cents in the past 30 days. The consensus mark indicates a 41.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.42 per share.Meanwhile, Micron estimates revenues of $7.2 billion (+/- $400 million). The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $6.92 billion, suggesting a 16.3% decrease from the year-earlier period.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.7%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayMicron’s fourth-quarter overall performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by soft consumer spending due to rising inflationary pressure and growing concerns over the global economic slowdown. Softened consumer spending has resulted in weakening memory chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer (PC) end markets.Moreover, Micron’s exposure to PC and notebooks might have hurt its overall sales growth in the quarter under review. PC and notebook manufacturers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to the shortage of other components to complete PC assembling.However, Micron expects the demand for memory chips from the data center end market to remain strong, driven by increased investments by organizations in cloud adoption and digital transformation initiatives. Moreover, a solid uptick in dynamic random access memory bit shipments for the graphics, 5G, automotive and industrial markets is anticipated to continue acting as a key catalyst.We believe that growth in the data center and automotive and industrial end markets is likely to have partially offset the negative impact of weakening demand across smartphone and PC markets.Story continuesIndustry-wide component supply constraints are expected to have hurt Micron’s top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. MU is witnessing supply constraints for certain integrated circuit components, which are expected to have negatively impacted bit shipments in the quarter under review.The memory chip maker’s heavy dependence on China is a headwind due to the ongoing tit-for-tat trade spat between the United States and China. Additionally, a higher mix of lower-margin NAND, coupled with low memory prices and a minimal decline in manufacturing costs, is expected to have strained margins.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Micron this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

HAS is likely to benefit from strong gaming demand, increased focus on eOne content and expansion initiatives. However, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are a concern.Let’s discuss the factors that suggest why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Major Growth DriversHasbro is witnessing a strong gaming demand during the coronavirus crisis. Hasbro has a supreme gaming portfolio and is refining gaming experiences across many platforms like face-to-face gaming, tabletop gaming and digital gaming experiences on mobile. The company's gaming category, which includes Magic: The Gathering, NERF, Peppa Pig, My Little Pony, Transformers and Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio are performing well. Wizards generated solid performance on the back of Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The heightened engagement was witnessed in desktop and mobile versions, attracting new arena players. The company emphasized on integrating D&amp;D Beyond into Wizards’ business to drive growth. It anticipates the digital content platform substantially accelerating its direct-to-fans capability for DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS in physical and digital play. The company expects the acquisition to be accretive to EPS in 2023 and beyond.Hasbro continues to focus on adapting plans to deliver a robust lineup of entertainment and innovation from E1 and its partners. Notably, on the content side, E1 production is gradually recovering through a new animated series on Netflix and Alien TV. The team has been witnessing solid feedback for the contents in Peppa Pig, PJ Mask and the My Little Pony feature film.The eOne team continues to develop and move into the production of Hasbro IPs of more than 200 projects in development across TV, film, and animation. The company said that the eOne team is working on more than 35 development projects for Hasbro brands, including content for TRANSFORMERS, MAGIC, D&amp;D, PEPPA PIG, MY LITTLE PONY, POWER RANGERS and PLAY-DOH, among many others. It emphasized on feature films such as Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Dungeons &amp; Dragons to be a driving factor for boosting revenues and operating profits in 2023.Story continuesIn addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses, the company seeks to grow its international business by expanding into emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin and South America. Emerging markets offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets and have been contributing significantly to Hasbro's revenues, given its investments in advertising and other brand-building efforts. During second-quarter fiscal 2022, markets in North America and Latin America witnessed solid growth. Over the next few years, Hasbro anticipates the emerging markets to grow in double digits, backed by innovation in products, entertainment and market share gains.ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of the company have declined 30.3% so far this year against the industry’s fall of 8.3%. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures had taken a toll on the company. Although the company’s operations continue to recover from the negative impact of the coronavirus crisis, the implications of future disruptions cannot be ruled out. The company expects difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to constraints in port capacity, shipping containers and truck transportation. It expects the headwinds to persist throughout 2022.Hasbro has been incurring increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. The company has been shouldering high expenses related to freight and input for quite some time. During the fiscal second quarter, Hasbro's cost of sales (as a percentage of net revenues) came in at 30.7% compared with 26.1% in the prior-year quarter. The company anticipates inflationary pressures to persist for the majority of 2022.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

277,917cb567-6b45-30d4-873e-8684bc6a213d,MCD,2022-09-27,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-mcdonalds-corporation-120056357.html,1664280056,STORY,['MCD'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for McDonald's What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.45bUS$8.61bUS$8.64bUS$9.09bUS$9.44bUS$9.75bUS$10.0bUS$10.3bUS$10.5bUS$10.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.26%Est @ 2.87%Est @ 2.59%Est @ 2.39%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$7.0kUS$7.6kUS$7.1kUS$7.0kUS$6.8kUS$6.6kUS$6.4kUS$6.1kUS$5.9kUS$5.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.7%– 1.9%) = US$231bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$231b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$121bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$187b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$244, the company appears about fair value at a 4.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.119. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

McDonald's also won high marks on the Street for solid sales trends in the first half of the year.But that vibe may change, according to Tower.Here are the details behind the analyst's call:Price Target: $246 (lowered from $275)Rating: Neutral (reiterated; 90-day negative catalyst watch)Stock price movement assumed: Virtually noneTower goes short-term negative on McDonald's stock for a host of reasons.""We see increasingly less favorable risk-reward in McDonald's shares, with FX and macroeconomic challenges in Europe looming over EPS estimates heading into 3Q/the winter months, and a valuation (EV/EBITDA near all-time highs vs the market) leaving little room for shares to absorb negative estimate revisions.""McDonald's food sits on a table in one of the fast food restaurants on July 26, 2022 in Miami, Florida. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Europe's economic slowdown is an increasing source of risk for McDonald's.""Inflation in key European markets has ramped rapidly and is now taking a low-double digit bite out of discretionary spending power (compared to a mid-single digit to high-single digit hit in the U.S.), with less of an offset from employment growth. Risks mount into the winter, with greater energy usage/potential knock-on effects of energy prices.""The U.S. can't carry all the weight for McDonald's.""We understand (and agree with) expectations for continued U.S. strength; however, we estimate the U.S. business would need mid-single-digit same-store sales upside on top of existing expectations to offset the profit impact from: (1) dollar strength since 2Q earnings, and (2) even a low-single-digit hit to aggregate Europe same-store sales. Conversations suggest investors are sharpening pencils on both topics, and we expect risks to become better priced in: (1) during the approach to/aftermath of 3Q results, (2) as the focus shifts to 2023.""Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

He also said that McDonald's had created an ""African-American tier"" with a smaller budget—a tier in which he believes his TV networks have been categorized.""This is about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy,"" Allen said in a press release last week.""McDonald's takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back.

Extra Space Storage could not escape the hit.Despite the recent sell-off, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has strong growth potential and seems a solid choice for your portfolio. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExtra Space Storage has earned solid recognition in the self-storage industry. The company has been trying to grow its business and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services. It enjoys a solid presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long-term profitability.These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage REIT emerge as the second-largest self-storage owner and/or operator and largest self-storage management company in the United States.Let’s Explore What Makes EXR Stock a Solid ChoiceExpansion Efforts: Extra Space Storage significantly expanded its business in recent years, growing its branded-store count from 910 in 2012 to 2,177 as of Jun 30, 2022, in 41 states and Washington D.C. The total stores managed by third-party owners increased from 181 to 864 during the same period. Along with acquisitions, the company is making strategic investments through other channels in the storage sector, including preferred equity investments and bridge loan programs. With a focus on primary and secondary markets, Extra Space Storage is well-poised to capitalize on favorable trends.Recently, as part of its efforts to boost the national portfolio and the operating platform, Extra Space Storage has completed the acquisition of Storage Express for roughly $590 million. The move added 107 remotely operated stores across Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky to EXR’s portfolio.Healthy Asset Fundamentals: The self-storage asset category is need-based and recession-resilient. This asset class has low capital-expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry continues to benefit from favorable demographic changes. The migration and downsizing trend and increase in the number of people renting homes have escalated the needs of consumers to rent space at a storage facility to park their possessions. Further, demand for self-storage space has increased amid the flexible working environment.Strong Operating Performance: Extra Space Storage’s better-than-expected second quarter 2022 performance reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth. The same-store net operating income (“NOI”) improved year over year. Moreover, during the second-quarter 2022 earnings release, Extra Space Storage raised its 2022 outlook. It expects core FFO per share in the range of $8.30-$8.50, up from $8.05-$8.30 projected earlier. Management revised estimates for same-store revenue growth, expecting it to lie within 16-18%, up from the earlier range of 13-15%. Same-store NOI growth is projected in the band of 18.5-21.5%, up from 15-18% estimated earlier and acquisitions of $1.2 billion, up from the previous estimate of $800 million.Superior Cash Flow Growth and High ROE: Extra Space Storage’s current cash flow growth is projected at 50.41% compared with the 9.7% growth projected for the industry. This REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (“ROE”) highlights its growth potential. Extra Space Storage’s ROE is 24.31% compared with the industry’s average of 3.76%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared with the industry.With solid balance sheet strength, the company is well-poised to capitalize on external growth opportunities, which will likely increase.Dividend Payouts: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Extra Space Storage remains committed to increasing shareholders’ wealth. In February 2022, Extra Space Storage announced a first-quarter 2022 dividend of $1.50 per share on the common stock, which marked a 20% increase over the prior-quarter dividend and a 50% hike over the first-quarter 2021 dividend. The company maintained its payment after that. Its dividend reported a 5-year increase of 92.3%. Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.Estimate Revisions: The estimate revision trend for full-year 2022 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook for this self-storage REIT. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share has moved north marginally over the past week to $8.49. The projected FFO per share growth rate for 2022 is 22.9%.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other key picks from the REIT sector include Prologis PLD and Terreno Realty Corporation TRNO.Prologis carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.

The other asset, which is in Fort Payne, was acquired through a UPREIT transaction and carries 14.8 years of residual NNN term.The addition of these mission-critical industrial facilities in growth markets has helped GOOD improve the weighted average lease term and increase its industrial concentration.

From the beginning of the year through Aug 31, 2022, the company shelled out $83.9 million as the total cost for the acquisition of 988,303 square feet of industrial real estate.

As of Aug 31, 2022, Gladstone Commercial’s portfolio occupancy was 96.9% due to successful leasing activities. The company collected 100% of the August cash base rent.

In that same time, the Transportation sector lost 15.42%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 10.4%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from United Parcel Service as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 25, 2022. On that day, United Parcel Service is projected to report earnings of $2.86 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.54%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $24.39 billion, up 5.19% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.85 per share and revenue of $101.67 billion. These totals would mark changes of +5.94% and +4.5%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, American Express is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Moody's has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that AXP likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MCO has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.AXP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.20, while MCO has a forward P/E of 26.92.

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.45.Another notable valuation metric for AXP is its P/B ratio of 4.53. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

The company is expecting an increase in digital health demand with the adoption of digital healthcare management systems. The stiff competition faced by ResMed is worrying. This apart, reimbursement issues and competitive bidding continue to affect the stock. ResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 23.5% compared with the 51.2% decline of the industry.ResMed exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded robust sales performance on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. Revenue growth across several geographies is impressive. The growing adoption of ResMed’s AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 platforms raises investors’ confidence.The continued uptake of core non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease is encouraging too. The expansion of gross margin seems promising. Increased focus on international markets, a robust product line and strong solvency are added benefits.ResMed Inc. PriceResMed Inc. PriceResMed Inc. price | ResMed Inc. QuoteTo meet the additional demand in relation to a competitor’s recall, the company is working closely with its global supply chain partners to improve access to further supplies of critical components. The company is also reengineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, supplies and speeding up product launches as well as development to keep up with the demand. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company derived incremental revenues in the range of $60-$70 million associated with the competitor’s recall.ResMed continues to see robust demand for a market-leading mask portfolio despite facing challenges related to declining new patient setups from a competitor recall. The company recorded increased masks and other sales in the United States, Canada and the Latin-America region in the fiscal fourth quarter, where growth was 13% on a reported basis, reflecting solid resupply revenues amid a challenging device supply environment. In combined Europe, Asia and other markets, masks and other sales rose 7% at CER. Globally, masks and other sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 11% at CER.Story continuesResMed, during the fiscal fourth quarter, recorded an 11% year-over-year increase in device sales in the United States, Canada and Latin-America region, benefiting from incremental revenues from a competitor's recall. Furthermore, device sales increased 2% year over year and 6% at CER on a global basis. In the reported quarter, the company introduced the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud solution to address the needs of an industry crisis in PAP supply. The company expects the new device, along with the AirSense 11 and its legacy AirSense 10 device to support solid growth throughout fiscal 2023.On the flip side, ResMed did not derive any incremental revenues from COVID-related demand in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. During the quarter, ResMed’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose 7.4% year over year (up 12% at CER) predominantly on increases in employee-related expenses, professional service fees and travel expenses.Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 7.4% (up 11% at CER). These mounting expenses led to an adjusted operating margin contraction of 24 bps year over year to 29.5%, weighing on the company’s bottom line. The persistent supply-chain challenges related to securing sufficient components hamper its ability to meet the growing device demand. The volatility surrounding COVID restrictions across the globe also continue to pose challenges.ResMed's ability to sell its products largely depends on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of its products.In some markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of  products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other markets, such as Australia, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat SDB conditions.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space  are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

298,aa0aadd4-0f6f-3256-b070-bafbb9026324,OXY,2022-09-27,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-attracting-130001027.html,1664197201,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -20.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -10.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has lost 12% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +229.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 points to a change of +331.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.28 indicates a change of -15.7% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +45.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $39.04 billion and $36.44 billion estimates indicate +48.4% and -6.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $10.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +78.6%. EPS of $3.16 for the same period compares with $0.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.22%. The EPS surprise was +7.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thereafter, a two month-long impressive summer rally raised hope among market participants that the market might have bottomed out. However, the Fed’s tougher-than-expected hawkish monetary stance in the Jackson Hole Symposium last month and its September FOMC meeting destroyed all hopes.Inflation, Rate Hike and Recession ConcernsThe Fed, so far, has been unable to cool down inflation from a 40-year high despite adopting ultra-hawkish monetary stances. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% year to date, unseen since 1990.Moreover, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively. Market participants are now adjusting the cost of an imminent recession in the U.S. economy into stock markets’ valuationAs of Sep 23, our projection has shown that the overall earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to grow 1.1% year over year. This indicates a stiff fall from 8.1% earnings growth year over year estimated in Jun 15. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have tumbled 10.3%, 10.8% and 12.2%, respectively, in the past month.Our Top PicksDespite this grim scenario, a handful of stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days. This means that investors are expecting these companies to do solid business for the rest of 2022, defying macro-economic headwinds. Investment in such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful going forward.We have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong growth potential for the rest of 2022. Each of our picks currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum Corp. MPC is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last 7 days.Albemarle Corp. ALB should gain from long-term growth in the battery-grade lithium market. It is expected to benefit from its actions to boost its global lithium derivative capacity. ALB will also benefit from the synergies of the Rockwood acquisition. The buyout has enhanced diversity across end markets.Albemarle also remains focused on executing its cost-reduction program. Its cost-saving actions are expected to support margins in 2022. ALB also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging strong cash flows. It remains focused on maintaining its dividend payout. Albemarle has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations.Albemarle has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 30 days.HF Sinclair Corp. DINO operates as an independent energy company. DINO produces and markets gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, renewable diesel, specialty lubricant products, specialty chemicals, specialty and modified asphalt, and others.HF Sinclair also owns and operates refineries located in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and markets its refined products principally in the Southwest United States and Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, and in other neighboring Plains states.HF Sinclair has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last 7 days.Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTA has been benefiting from its omnichannel strength. Also, the skincare category has been gaining from consumers’ rising interest in self-care. ULTA’s solid performance was backed by the strong execution of its strategies and solid guest demand, with the latter gaining from exciting brand launches.Also, increased in-person activities and travel have been leading to the revival of the beauty category demand. All major categories delivered double-digit comp sales growth. Encouragingly, Ulta Beauty raised its fiscal 2022 view.Ulta Beauty has an expected earnings growth rate of 2% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.6% over the last 30 days.Carlisle Companies Inc. CSL is set to gain from strength in the U.S. reroofing end markets besides its acquired assets. Strength in the medical technologies business and the commercial aerospace business is likely to drive CSL’s performance.Strength in the reroofing market in the United States and growth in the architectural metals platform will likely benefit its CCM segment. Carlisle expects the segment's 2022 revenues to jump about 40% on a year-over-year basis. CSL’s focus on product launches and the growing backlog will likely benefit it.Carlisle Companies has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

Vertex will submit its biologics licensing application (BLA) for exa-cel for rolling review, beginning in November 2022 and expects to complete the submission by the end of Q1 2023.Vertex previously completed discussions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the data required to support those marketing applications and is on track to submit by the end of 2022.""We are pleased to have concluded our exa-cel pre-submission meetings with regulators and are excited that FDA has granted a rolling review,"" said Nia Tatsis Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Chief Regulatory and Quality Officer. ""We continue to work with urgency to bring forward the first CRISPR therapy for a genetic disease, and one that holds potential to transform the lives of patients with sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia.""Based on progress in this program to date, exa-cel has been granted multiple important regulatory designations, including Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the FDA for both SCD and TDT. Exa-cel has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the EMA, for both SCD and TDT.Story continuesExa-cel is being investigated in multiple ongoing clinical trials as a potential one-time therapy for patients with either SCD or TDT.About exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel)Exa-cel, formerly known as CTX001™, is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients with TDT or SCD, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. The elevation of HbF by exa-cel has the potential to alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT and reduce painful and debilitating sickle crises for patients with SCD. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021 and updated results were shared at the annual European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress in June 2022.About CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121The ongoing Phase 1/2/3 open-label trials, CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 12 to 35 years with TDT or SCD, respectively. The trials are now closed for enrollment. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after exa-cel infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB‑131, a long-term ‑follow-up trial.About CLIMB-131This is a long-term, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exa-cel in patients who received exa-cel in CLIMB‑111, CLIMB‑121, CLIMB‑141 or CLIMB‑151. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after exa-cel infusion.About CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151The ongoing Phase 3 open-label trials, CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or SCD, respectively. The trials are now open for enrollment and currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years of age and will plan to extend to ages 2 to less than 5 years of age at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 12 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene‑Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, exa-cel, will then be infused back into the patient as part of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), a process which involves a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing HSCT may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of exa-cel. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of exa-cel on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. Exa-cel represents the first potential treatment to emerge from the joint research program. Under an amended collaboration agreement, Vertex now leads global development, manufacturing and commercialization of exa-cel and splits program costs and profits worldwide 60/40 with CRISPR Therapeutics.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

This gives consumer staples stocks hedging capabilities against inflation or events that might derail the broader market such as an economic slowdown or recession.Many consumer staples stocks have also outperformed the broader market so far this year as they offer growth and value despite tough operating conditions for many businesses.Let’s take a look at three consumer staples stocks that can potentially offer protection against inflation.  The Chef’s Warehouse CHEFAfter its 2017 IPO, The Chef’s Warehouse has become a consumer staples stock that investors may want to familiarize themselves with. The Chefs’ Warehouse is a distributor of specialty food products in the U.S. The company caters to the specific needs of chefs who operate restaurants in a variety of establishments, with a focus on higher-end dining. Chef’s Warehouse’s product portfolio includes artisan charcuterie, caviar, specialty cheeses, and many other ingredients geared toward the specific usage of professional cooks.CHEF currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimates on the rise. Year to date, CHEF is down -7% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -22%. Despite being down YTD, CHEF is up impressive +124% over the last two years to crush the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $30 a share, CHEF has a forward P/E 22.3X. This is above the industry average of 17.7X. However, this is much lower than its high of 50.7X and the median of 32X over the last year. Rising earnings estimate revisions are starting to support CHEF’s niche among the consumer staples sector and as a possible hedge in current market conditions.Chef’s Warehouse is expected to swing from an annual loss of -$0.05 per share all the way to +$1.36 a share. Fiscals 2023 calls for another 16% earnings growth. Top line growth indicates CHEF is able to keep growing in the midst of inflation, with sales expected to be up 41% in FY22 and another 10% in FY23 to $2.70 billion.Story continuesPlus, the average Zacks Price Target suggests upside of 50% from current levels. Higher income customers are still spending on fine dining which continues to support upscale restaurants use of Chef’s Warehouse as a distributor of specialty food products.General Mills GIS A well-known name for investors to consider out of the consumer staples sector is General Mills (GIS). General Mills is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold in retail stores. The company serves the foodservice and commercial baking industries through products that include cereals, convenient mills, snacks, and ice cream.General Mills’ familiarized consumer products are considered necessities even through tough economic times. This is why analysts and investors look to GIS during recessionary periods.CEO Jeff Harmening said on GIS’ earnings call that the company continues to deliver strong performance in a highly volatile operating environment. Harmening went on to say General Mills is raising its full year outlook for net sales, operating profit, and EPS growth, which is rather striking as the earnings outlook for the broader S&amp;P 500 outside of energy is trending in the wrong direction.This gives optimism to investors with GIS providing the positive outlook and raising its guidance just a few days ago after beating earnings expectations by 11% at $1.11 a share.GIS is up an impressive +17% year to date to outperform the benchmark. Even better, over the last year GIS is up +31% to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -17% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAt current levels GIS has a forward P/E of 19.4X, not to far from the industry average of 17.7X. GIS currently trades around its high over the last five years of 20.2X and above the median of 16.2X. However, estimate revisions for 2022 and Fiscal 2023 are starting to go up.According to Zacks estimates, GIS earnings are expected to be up 3% in 2022 at $4.07 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to grow another 7%. Sales are expected to be up 2% this year and another 2% in FY23 to $19.87 billion.GIS currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With inflationary concerns prevalent in the broader economy, investors might want to consider buying GIS. General Mills products will remain necessary even during times of economic strain and might even become more popular. GIS also offers investors a respectable annual dividend yield of 2.73% at $2.16 a share.Coca-Cola KOCoca-Cola’s beverages will still be consumed even when the economy drifts toward recessionary periods. Coca-Cola is a global operator and distributor of over 4,700 beverage products and more than 500 brands. KO is only down -1% in 2022 to outperform the benchmark. Over the last two years KO is up +20% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s +16%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $58 a share, KO has a forward P/E 23.7X. This is on par with the industry average. KO trades below its high of 29X over the last two years and its 25.2X median.KO’s earnings are expected to be up 6% this year at $2.46 a share. And fiscal year 2023 calls for another 5% earnings growth. Sales are expected to be up 9% in 2022 and another 3% in FY23 to $43.73 billion. KO currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Beverages-Soft drinks Industry is in the top 27% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Coco-Cola is one of the quintessential consumer staples companies that tends to perform well during good times and bad. And its 3% dividend yield tops rival PepsiCo’s (PEP) 2.7%.Bottom Line With the Fed raising interest rates again last week, fear is beginning to ring out in markets. This can also spill over to the broader economy and lead to a tightening in consumer spending. Many Consumer Staples Sector companies offer products that remain essential even during recessionary environments and periods of high inflation, making them ideal candidates for the current times.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:INTU) sold US$22m worth of stock at an average price of US$519 a share over the past year, making the most of their investment. After the stock price dropped 6.6% last week, the company's market value declined by US$7.9b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At IntuitIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Laura Fennell, sold US$9.1m worth of shares at a price of US$611 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$396. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Intuit didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Intuit better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Intuit Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Intuit shares. In total, insider Varun Krishna sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of IntuitFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Intuit insiders own 2.8% of the company, worth about US$3.1b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Intuit Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Intuit has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

318,d4dea77a-c335-3002-a1d2-65200854fbac,INTU,2022-09-27,Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Gains as Market Hits Fresh Lows,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blue-chip-stocks-buy-long-222710446.html,1664231230,STORY,"['INTU', 'MA']","[Stocks continue to tumble as Wall Street ramps up selling in response to heightened fears about slowing economic growth. The S&amp;P 500 hit new 52-week lows on Monday. In fact, the benchmark index is now trading at its lowest levels since November 2020, with a recession more likely as the U.S. Federal Reserve and major central banks around the world lift interest rates to fight soaring inflation.The Fed and Jay Powell are poised to do all they can to drag prices down and are willing to cause economic pain to do so. The Fed’s 0.75% hike last week and its efforts in November and December are expected to lift the Fed Funds rate to between 4.25% and 4.5% by the end of 2022.The Fed’s aggressive actions and outlook, coupled with a flight to safety from investors around the globe have sent both the 10-year and the 2-year U.S. Treasuries to levels last seen during the financial crisis. Yields on the 10-year surged to around 3.9% Monday, up from 3.5% at the market’s mid-June lows and 1.6% in early 2022. The 2-year is floating at 4.4%, up from 0.80% at the start of 2022 and 0.30% this time last year.Higher rates impact equities markets in a variety of ways. Elevated yields make safe investments such as bonds more attractive, while lowering what investors are willing to pay for risk in the form of valuation multiples, and more.The higher interest rates have already dramatically cooled off the housing market and crushed growth-focused stocks. Plus, the overall outlook for S&amp;P 500 earnings is already trending heavily in the wrong direction, as higher rates and higher prices cool economic activity and eat into growth and profits.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe fact that substantially lower growth is already showing up in the earnings outlook and interest rates are responding to the Fed’s hawkish stance can be viewed as positives for longer-term investors looking to find solid entry points into strong stocks. Now it is impossible to call a market bottom in real-time and stocks could continue to slide.Story continuesThankfully, investors with long-term horizons shouldn’t be afraid to start small positions in blue-chip stocks amid the economic headwinds. The U.S. will bounce back and economic activity continues even during recessions. And always remember that many people are most excited to buy stocks near the market top and afraid to buy at what turns out, in retrospect, to be the lows.Here are two blue-chip stocks that investors might want to consider adding to their long-term portfolios as the market falls to new 52-week lows.Intuit Inc. INTUIntuit’s growing portfolio includes online tax help giant TurboTax, alongside accounting software, small business money management tools, personal finance offerings, and more. Intuit spent the last several years expanding its portfolio even more through two major acquisitions. INTU bought personal-finance portal Credit Karma in December 2020 and email-marketing standout Mailchimp last November.The addition of Mailchimp, which also provides digital ad services and customer-relationship-management tools, expands Intuit’s reach into brand new pockets of the economy. The diversified portfolio helps Intuit package more offerings to its small and mid-sized business clients and grow its customer base. Intuit now boasts over 100 customers worldwide.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit consistently grew its sales over the last 20+ years, with only two small YoY declines. This run includes sales growth between 11% and 32% over the last seven fiscal years. The firm’s adjusted FY22 earnings (period ended July 31) climbed 22% on 32% stronger sales (24% excluding Mailchimp). INTU’s FY23 and FY24 estimates have held up well since its August 23 release as its management teams remains bullish.Zacks estimates call for Intuit’s sales to climb 14% in FY23 and 13% next year to help lift its adjusted earnings by 16% and 15%, respectively. The growth outlook highlights how crucial Intuit’s portfolio remains in the face of a wide-ranging economic downturn. INTU’s earnings estimates have held up well for it to grab a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuit hasn’t stayed above the selling, which has hit growth-focused firms particularly hard. INTU shares have tumbled 45% below their 2021 peaks. But the stock is still up 175% over the last five years to crush the Zacks Tech sector’s 55% and 575% during the last decade. The heavy selling, mixed with its strong earnings outlook, has recalibrated its valuation in a big way. Intuit is still trading at a significant premium to the tech sector at 42.1X forward 12-month earnings vs. 19.1X. But this puts INTU near its own 10-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit’s tax and other software offerings are set to remain vital during periods of both economic expansion and contraction. The company has a strong balance sheet and pays a dividend, which it recently raised by 15%. INTU also approved another $2 billion in share buybacks to up its current authorization to $3.5 billion. Intuit stock trades 50% below its current Zacks consensus price target. And Wall Street remains extremely bullish on the stock, with 16 of the 17 brokerage recommendations Zacks has accumulated at “Strong Buys.” Therefore, investors might want to consider starting a position in the diversified software stock despite the economic turbulence.Mastercard Incorporated MAMastercardis a consumer and business credit card powerhouse that operates an elaborate backend processing network. On top of its core credit card segment, MA is actively diversifying to help transform the firm into a financial technology titan designed to thrive in a digital payments economy alongside the likes of Block SQ, the big Wall Street banks, and countless upstarts.Some of Mastercard’s newer efforts include cryptocurrency, buy now, pay later offerings, and other endeavors focused on the future of a mostly digital transaction-based economy. Mastercard’s core credit card segment remains strong, with it travel-focused cross-border segment thriving despite economic downturn fears. The company topped our second quarter EPS and sales estimates at the end of July, as “overall consumer spending remained robust.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMastercard provided upbeat guidance at the time because people continue to spend heavily despite 40-year high inflation. It is also vital to remember that higher-income customers account for a large chunk of retail spending, and they are being impacted far less by 8% inflation. In fact, Mastercard managed to up its outlook for FY22 last quarter, with inflationary pressures “yet to significantly impact overall consumer spending.”Mastercard’s 2021 revenue surged 23% to outpace its pre-pandemic totals by $2 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted FY21 earnings climbed 31%. Zacks estimates call for 18% sales expansion in 2022 and over 16% higher revenue in FY23 to reach $25.89 billion. Mastercard’s adjusted EPS are expected to surge 27% this year and another 19% in 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMastercard’s ability to grow its sales and earnings by double the inflation rate is outstanding. And it’s only failed to beat our EPS estimates once in the last five years. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 11% last year and it still has $6.7 billion left on its share current repurchase plan. Mastercard currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and 12 of the 17 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” with three more “Buys,” and two “Holds.”Mastercard shares had held up better than many other growth-heavy stocks in 2022 until they plummeted alongside most of the market in the middle of August. MA shares are down around 20% since August 15 to close regular trading Monday at $290 per share. These levels offer 42% upside to Mastercard’s current Zacks consensus price target.The recent downturn has readjusted Mastercard’s valuation, with MA now trading near its covid lows at 24.2X forward 12-month earnings. MA’s forward P/E marks a 25% discount to its own five-year median and 10% vs. its decade-long median. The stock is trading at these levels even though Mastercard shares are still up 110% over the last five years and 1,800% in the past 15 years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

321,d01a5a93-adcb-3911-8ff0-00220f7b2ae7,IR,2022-09-27,Should Weakness in Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s (NYSE:IR) Stock Be Seen As A Sign That Market Will Correct The Share Price Given Decent Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-ingersoll-rand-inc-nyse-163425048.html,1664210065,STORY,['TT'],"[Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR) has had a rough month with its share price down 8.7%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Ingersoll Rand's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ingersoll Rand is:6.1% = US$539m ÷ US$8.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Ingersoll Rand's Earnings Growth And 6.1% ROEWhen you first look at it, Ingersoll Rand's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 13%. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Ingersoll Rand grew its net income at a significant rate of 34% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Ingersoll Rand's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 8.4% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is IR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Ingersoll Rand Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Ingersoll Rand has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 3.1%, meaning that it has the remaining 97% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.While Ingersoll Rand has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 4.0% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Ingersoll Rand's future ROE will rise to 11% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Ingersoll Rand has some positive aspects to its business. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

(SoCalGas) today announced that its [H2] Innovation Experience in Downey is now using renewable hydrogen that is produced onsite. The project will demonstrate the resiliency and reliability of a renewable hydrogen microgrid that can power neighborhoods – just in time to kick off National Clean Energy Week.The [H2] Innovation Experience features a nearly 2,000 square-foot home that can use reliable and clean hydrogen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, by drawing power from solar panels on sunny days and converting excess energy into renewable hydrogen, which can be stored and then converted back into electricity, as needed, via an on-site hydrogen fuel cell. Hydrogen will also be blended with natural gas and used in the home's tank-less water heater, clothes dryer, and gas stove, fireplace and BBQ grill. The home is being constructed to LEED Platinum standards.The project's electrolyzer, which uses solar power to split water, has now produced its first full kilogram of renewable hydrogen – the first ever produced by SoCalGas -- which is intended to power a fuel cell to provide power when solar isn't available. One kilogram of hydrogen, roughly equivalent to a gallon of gasoline, emits only water as a byproduct. The limited production of hydrogen at this site as part of this demonstration project is specifically intended to show the microgrid's effectiveness in terms of reliability and resiliency.""The production of the first kilogram of renewable hydrogen by SoCalGas is a key milestone as we prepare to welcome visitors to our [H2] Innovation Experience in the coming months,"" said Neil Navin, Vice President of Clean Energy Innovations at SoCalGas. ""This project shows the essential role clean fuels like renewable hydrogen can play in meeting California's clean energy and resiliency goals and highlights our progress toward making net zero a reality. And projects like this, along with efforts like those to develop a statewide hydrogen blending standard, have the potential to drive down the costs of renewable hydrogen, making it a valuable tool to help decarbonize California.""Story continues""On behalf of my council colleagues and myself, I would like to congratulate SoCalGas on this momentous achievement,"" added Downey Mayor Blanca Pacheco. ""The use of green hydrogen could greatly reduce carbon emissions and help in our fight against climate change. By building on the benefits of using hydrogen generated by renewable energy, our city can continue to be at the forefront of technology and environmental sustainability.""SoCalGas is at the forefront of sustainability having announced its aim to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. It is the first large natural gas utility in the United States to do so.SoCalGas has been at the forefront of clean energy innovation and is aggressively working to develop a suite of tools to help with those decarbonization efforts, particularly in hard-to-electrify sectors: hydrogen, hydrogen blending, renewable natural gas and carbon management, to name some of the clean energy tools being developed and employed as part of its overall clean energy strategy.That strategy is already in full motion. Earlier this month, SoCalGas partnered with UCI on a proposal to demonstrate how hydrogen can be safely blended into existing natural gas infrastructure on the university's campus and take California a step closer to establishing a statewide injection standard for renewable hydrogen. Additionally, in February, the company proposed developing the Angeles Link, a dedicated green hydrogen energy infrastructure system for delivering clean reliable energy to the Los Angeles Basin to serve hard to electrify sectors of the economy like electric generation, heavy-duty transportation, and heavy industry and manufacturing.SoCalGas research has shown that with clean fuels like renewable natural gas and hydrogen, coupled with carbon management, California can reach 100% net zero goals more affordably, more equitably and with less risk of power disruptions, customer conversion barriers, and technological limitations.For more information on the [H2] Innovation Experience, click here.About SoCalGasHeadquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

326,5ecedbc4-26c7-36f6-93ca-29e46ff74bce,GE,2022-09-27,FOCUS-Aircraft parts output is being grounded by worker shortages,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-aircraft-parts-output-being-100000413.html,1664272800,STORY,"['BA', 'AIR.PA', 'RTX', 'GE']","[By Allison Lampert and Rajesh Kumar SinghMONTREAL/CHICAGO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Canada's Mitchell Aerospace has a booming business - and a shop-floor shortfall that is reverberating from Boeing to Airbus.The Montreal-based supplier of aircraft parts has an order backlog from clients such as Raytheon Technologies, as aircraft makers push to ramp up output after a two-year slump.Like other companies that supply precision cast parts for everything from landing gear to engine components, Mitchell Aerospace is facing a labor shortage expected to hobble plane production through 2023.""It's just a hurricane in the plant,"" said company President Guillermo Alonso. ""There's just no time. It's just produce, produce, produce and find ways to improve your productivity.""A slowing global economy has started to unwind some supply chain shortages that hit manufacturers and contributed to inflation. Demand for shipping and airfreight have softened, chip sales are slowing and used car prices in the United States are falling.But aircraft parts makers are still reeling from deep job cuts undertaken when planes were grounded during the pandemic, a sign of how uneven the supply chain crisis remains.In the United States, aerospace employment is 8.4% below its pre-pandemic level. In the province of Quebec, where Mitchell is located, the industry needs to fill 38,000 jobs in the next decade, according to industry trade group Aero Montreal.Major casting makers like Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Precision Castparts Corp and Pittsburgh-based Howmet Aerospace , which supply Boeing, Airbus and General Electric , are hiring after slashing staffing in 2020.But it takes time to train new hires. Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun warned that labor will remain a bottleneck for the industry for years.""I don't see this getting resolved any time soon,"" Calhoun told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this month.Story continuesThe problem is most acute in the highly labor intensive, hard to automate castings industry. In a recent Jefferies survey, nearly three-fourths of aerospace equipment makers cited castings as the largest source of shortages.Privately-held Mitchell Aerospace is encouraging staff to take overtime, raising wages by 4.75%, and offering workers referral bonuses. It is also trying to hire more women, immigrants and refugees from Ukraine.Some casting suppliers are taking as much as 72 weeks to fill in orders, said David Wireman, a managing director at AlixPartners.Rising interest rates and mounting economic uncertainty are making companies wary about ramping up capacity, given concerns that demand could collapse, he said. ""It is going to be a rocky time for quite a while.""‘IT’S ALL LABOR’Meanwhile, the struggle to find workers is rippling through the supply chain, delaying jet engine and aircraft production at a time when much of the air travel market is booming.Leesta Industries, a Mitchell customer, is also wrestling with delays and quality problems from a different castings producer.When that producer delivers a month late, Montreal-based Leesta, which makes engine and landing gear components, must adjust to meet its own deadlines, said President Ernie Staub.""Your actual lead time of your product has been hurt by a month. You have to be ahead on the rest of your work,"" he said.Raytheon recently said tight supplies of castings has left it operating ""hand-to-mouth,"" warning that delivery of some Pratt &amp; Whitney large commercial engines might slip into the first quarter of 2023. The company did not specify the previous timeline for the deliveries.Rival GE said supply shortages have made it harder to deliver engines on time.Their customers are feeling the pinch. Airbus' production target has declined, while Boeing warned supply chain pressures have capped its ability to ramp up output.Mitchell's Montreal factory starts humming before sunrise with workers in protective gear filling mold sections with a mix of fine sand and a bonding agent. The whirring and grinding stops by mid-afternoon with no workers for a second shift.""It's all labor,"" said Alonso, who is looking for shop workers and metallurgists. ""We have the demand.""Mitchell can only pass on about half of its higher costs to customers. Automating a part of Mitchell's sand casting production by next year could address some labor issues, higher costs and allow for growth, Alonso said.He sees robots replacing a job in which a worker must remove debris from castings. The work is repetitive and the part is at risk of damage in the process.""We haven't pulled the trigger on the investment yet,"" Alonso said, ""but it's a necessity.""

And indications are that we’re running into trouble. As a result, there are many stocks to sell. Over the past few weeks several leading U.S. companies have issued negative pre-announcements, lowered or pulled their forward guidance, implemented cost cuts, and warned of more pain ahead. The reasons for the dire outlooks range from inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, to weakening consumer demand and rising interest rates. It all adds up to what could be a very negative spate of third quarter earnings in the coming weeks. Poor results from leading blue-chip companies in the U.S. are sure to send already jittery stock markets lower.With that in mind, here are three stocks to sell before they get stomped by Q3 earnings.FDXFedEx$150.58GEGeneral Electric$63.72FFord$12.06InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFedEx (FDX)A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.comFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is one of the top stocks to sell. All after the company sent shockwaves through the market by pulling its earnings guidance and reporting preliminary results that missed expectations by a wide margin. The Memphis, Tennessee headquartered company blamed weakness in Asia and ongoing issues in Europe for the poor preliminary results and withdrawn guidance. Investors weren’t in a forgiving mood. FDX stock fell 21% immediately after its guidance was withdrawn, and dragged the market down with it.Earnings for the company’s fiscal first quarter were projected to be $3.44 per share. That’s well below the $5.10 average estimate of analysts who cover the shipping and logistics giant, according to Barron’s. Preliminary revenue of $23.2 billion in the quarter ended August 31 also missed Wall Street forecasts. To help right its ship, FedEx said it plans to cut costs by parking aircraft, cutting employee hours, and closing 90 FedEx locations.FDX stock is now down 42% on the year and trading at just over $150 per share. Sell before things get any worse.Story continuesGeneral Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comBoston-based industrial manufacturer General Electric (NYSE:GE) also recently issued a warning to analysts and investors. The company recently said that ongoing supply chain issues will drag down its upcoming earnings. Specifically, GE said that difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers are hurting its ability to deliver key products such as jet engines. The supply chain problems are pushing the company’s planned shipments further out into next year. All creating a situation that could negatively impact its profits, near term.General Electric also highlighted that it is facing other challenges such as squeezed profit margins at its healthcare division and a decline in demand for wind turbines. The myriad of problems are pressuring GE’s cash flow, which the company expects to be in line with the $162 million it generated in this year’s second quarter. To help improve the situation, GE plans to cut costs for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023, though it didn’t provide specific details.GE said it now expects full year earnings at the lower end of a $2.80 to $3.50 per share range. The company also lowered its free cash flow forecast by $1 billion, taking it down to between $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion for 2022. The latest earnings warning sent GE stock down 4%, bringing its year-to-date losses to 33%. The company’s shares are now trading at $63.68 apiece and have declined 67% over the last five years. Get out while you can.Ford (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comAs with FedEx, Ford (NYSE:F) sucker-punched markets with an earnings pre-announcement. Ford also leads the list of stocks to sell. The Detroit automaker said its supplier costs are $1 billion higher than had been expected due to rising inflation. As a result, Ford now anticipates earnings in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion when it next reports results in October. The revised forecast is well below the $3.7 billion in earnings Ford reported in its previous quarter, and the $3 billion it earned in the same period last year. F stock dropped 12.5% on the earnings warning, its worst one-day performance since 2011.Making matters worse, Ford said ongoing parts shortages are likely to keep its inventory of incomplete vehicles elevated in the months ahead. Specifically, Ford said its number of partially completed vehicles will total 40,000 to 45,000 at the end of the current third quarter. The company said it remains confident that it can complete and sell those unfinished vehicles by year’s end. Ford concluded its news release by saying it still expects to earn $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion for the full year, unchanged from its previous guidance. However, the company cautioned that it will provide more information about its finances when it releases Q3 earnings on Oct. 26.Ford stock is down 41% this year and changing hands at under $12 per share.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Chevron Corporation (CVX).

America’s No. 2 energy company’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc.

This marks the third consecutive rate hike of 0.75% and pushed the benchmark interest rate to 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. The central bank also signaled that additional large rate hikes were likely at upcoming meetings as it combats inflation that remains near a 40-year high (read: ETFs That Won After Fed Rate Hike).Fed officials now expect the federal funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a full percentage point above the 3.25% to 3.5% projected in June to end 2022. This means that the central bank could approve another three-quarter point hike at its November meeting and then a half-point rate rise in December.

(NYSE:EL) stock at an average price of US$290 per share allowing them to get the most out of their money. The company's market valuation decreased by US$3.3b after the stock price dropped 3.8% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Estée Lauder CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Fabrizio Freda, sold US$5.3m worth of shares at a price of US$268 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$232. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Estée Lauder Companies insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Estée Lauder Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Estée Lauder Companies. In total, insiders sold US$8.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of Estée Lauder CompaniesAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own about US$6.7b worth of shares (which is 8.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Estée Lauder Companies Insiders?Insiders sold Estée Lauder Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Estée Lauder Companies. While conducting our analysis, we found that Estée Lauder Companies has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.But note: Estée Lauder Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

UDR well for growth. Technological advancements and process enhancements also bode well for the company.The company’s properties are located throughout the United States, which includes a mix of urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations. Therefore, portfolio diversification with respect to geographies and price points limits UDR’s exposure to volatility and concentration risks alongside assuring stable cash flows.In addition, a favorable demographic trend in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent, is likely to fuel the demand for UDR’s properties.UDR’s technological investments and process enhancements are expected to help control future expenses and aid margin expansion and long-term profitability. Its Next Generation Operating Platform supports electronical interaction, provides service to residents and aids its business prospects. These efforts are likely to give the company a competitive edge over its peers.On the balance sheet front, UDR exited second-quarter 2022 with $1.3 billion of liquidity. The company has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule and no consolidated maturities until 2024.Also, investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1(Stable) and BBB+(Stable) from Moody's Investors Service and S&amp;P Global Ratings, respectively, give it favorable access to the debt market. Such a strong financial footing is likely to aid UDR’s long-term growth endeavors.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and UDR remains committed to that. In March 2022, the residential REIT announced a hike in its annualized dividend by 4.7% to $1.52 per share, resulting in a quarterly dividend of 38 cents. It has maintained this payment thereafter.Given its robust balance sheet position and a sustainable cash flow from operations, the dividend payment is likely to be sustainable in forthcoming quarters.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for UDR as it has been increased nearly 1% over the past two months to $2.32.However, its shares have lost 9.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s fall of 6.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegulatory restrictions regarding rent control or rent stabilization by certain states and municipalities have been limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees. Moreover, with government assistance coming to an end, any macroeconomic disturbances could hamper the company’s rental revenue growth in the near term.Although a decent development pipeline is encouraging for UDR’s long-term growth, a huge cost outlay ($599.5 million of which 66.9% was funded as of second-quarter 2022 end) exposes it to various operational risks such as a rise in construction costs, entitlement delays, lease-up risks and funding risks.Further, a hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT sector are Equity Residential EQR, Independence Realty Trust IRT and BRT Apartments BRT.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equity Residential’s 2022 FFO per share has moved 1.7% upward in the past two months to $3.51. EQR presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Independence Realty Trust’s current-year FFO per share has moved 1.9% northward in the past two months to $1.08. IRT also carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRT Apartments’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 5.8% over the past two months to $1.63.

Sometimes they will react to what we're doing,"" Hayes finally said.JetBlue's proposed deal for Spirit is expected to face a tough antitrust review. Hayes defended the acquisition from the witness stand, saying it would create ""one of the most powerful, disruptive forces that this country has seen.""The Justice Department has said that the Northeast Alliance eliminates incentives for American to cut prices to lure customers from JetBlue, a historically disruptive rival with often lower fares. It also gives the airlines a more than 80% market share in flights from Boston to Washington and six other airports.Story continuesIn opening arguments, lawyers for the airlines argued that contrary to the Justice Department's hypothetical claims of harm, the Northeast Alliance has produced significant real-word increases in flights and capacity since its unveiling in 2020.They argued the alliance allowed them to become a viable competitor to dominant Delta Air Lines and United Airlines operating out of Boston and John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports in the New York region.""More output like we're seeing here is highly competitive and leads to lower fares,"" Richard Schwed, JetBlue's lawyer, told U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin.The three-week trial opened after a week in which U.S. judges ruled against the government in two antitrust fights: sugar and insurance. The Justice Department and the states sued over the Northeast Alliance in September 2021.Airline mergers in recent years have led to a highly consolidated industry, in which American, Delta, United and Southwest Airlines control over 80% of domestic travel, the government argues.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston and Diane Bartz and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Jonathan Oatis, David Gregorio and Richard Chang)]"

President Biden touted the efforts to pressure airlines into changing their policies during a White House event on Monday afternoon.The overall effort — part of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s recent promise to make flying less painful — comes as other key issues such as constant flight cancellations and an ongoing pilot shortage elude quick fixes.""You should know the full cost of your ticket, right when you are comparison shopping to begin with so you can pick the ticket that actually is the best deal for you,"" Biden said Monday.President Joe Biden speaks during the third meeting of the White House Competition Council in the State Dining Room of the White House on September 26. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)The new rules would apply to extra charges such as baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees. They'll also apply to family seating fees that, much to flyers' chagrin, can be tacked onto fares during the last step of the booking process or after the ticket has been purchased — often significantly driving up the price.‘Help travelers make informed decisions’Under the proposed rule, customers searching online would see the fees the first time an airfare is displayed and potential fees for extras such as flight changes and baggage would also need to be shown immediately. The new rule would apply to flights inside the US and those that take off or land in the US.“Airline passengers deserve to know the full, true cost of their flights before they buy a ticket,” Buttigieg said in a statement, adding that the new rules “will help travelers make informed decisions and save money.”A trade group representing major US air carriers, Airlines for America, told Yahoo Finance in a statement that its airlines are already ""committed to providing the highest quality of service, which includes clarity regarding prices, fees and ticket terms.” The statement added: “Passenger carriers provide details regarding the breakdown of airfares on their websites, providing consumers clarity regarding the total cost of a ticket.”Story continuesThe group represents major airlines American (AAL), United (UAL), Delta (DAL), Southwest (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU), Hawaiian (HA), and Alaska (ALK).Monday's move is the latest from the Biden administration to try to improve the flying experience, at least on the margins. Recent efforts have included a new ""Airline Customer Service Dashboard"" as well as dediicating $1 billion to upgrade America’s airport terminals.Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg testifies before Congress in July. (REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger)'Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism'Nonetheless, the more deeply rooted problems such as a shortage of pilots and the related wave of cancellations earlier this summer haven’t proven as open to administration solutions.The Transportation Department is in the midst of a 90-day review process for another new rule around the issue of getting refunds in the event of flight cancellations. The administration is also pursuing enforcement actions against 10 airlines for extreme delays in providing refunds.On Monday, Biden said his administration's efforts were having an effect. “They cancel on you and you have to pay a fee to rebook. C’mon man,” he said. ""It’s simply not fair.""Airlines for America also also said Monday that its members “offer a range of options — including fully refundable fares — to increase accessibility to air travel and to help customers make ticket selections that best fit their needs.”In a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview, Melius Research Director Conor Cunningham noted that some of the overall pressures on flyers could be easing, while acknowledging delays are still a problem. Still, he added, ""Delays are better than cancellations, though obviously not great, but we're moving in the right direction, I guess.""Monday’s announcement came out of the third meeting of Biden’s White House Competition Council, whose members include Buttigieg, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and others. The group has the ambitious mandate of fostering competition across the economy from finance to health care to technology to transportation.Its efforts were also cast by the White House this week as an effort to also bring down costs in the face of inflation. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the average American loses up to $5,000 a year “due to lack of competition.”During his remarks Thursday, Biden applauded the Transportation Department’s move and said other agencies would soon do the same in their areas of influence pointing to fees from internet providers , banks, and cellphone companies.""Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation and we're building an economy that works for everyone,"" Biden said during his remarks.Ben Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.]"

355,34e9a7a9-73c2-3095-b309-3aaf28b60710,FRT,2022-09-27,3 Retail REITs With The Highest Upside According To Analysts,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-retail-reits-highest-upside-200053791.html,1664222453,STORY,"['RPT', 'TGT', 'FRT', 'SPG']","[When you get a 1-2 punch of inflation and recessionary fears as we’ve had in 2022, investors begin to lose faith in the ability of shopping centers and regional malls to thrive under adverse conditions. As a result, the prices of retail stocks have been hit hard in recent months. Analysts have been forced to lower their target prices, yet their upside targets from current levels remain high. Here are three retail REITs that analysts have recently cited as having the highest potential upside:RPT Realty (NYSE: RPT) is a NYC-based REIT that owns, operates and manages 57 open air shopping centers across 16 states, mostly in the Northeastern U.S. RPT Realty has a 93.3% overall occupancy rate in its portfolio of stores. This rate has been fairly stable over the last two years.The 52-week range for RPT is $7.51 to $14.99, but the stock has fallen 42% since last November. The stock is currently sitting right near its 52-week low.2nd quarter 2022 revenue declined, but earnings per share (EPS) was up from the previous quarter. RPT Realty pays a $0.52 annual dividend, yielding just above 6%.Raymond James analyst R.J. Milligan recently maintained an Outperform rating on RPT, while lowering the price target to $13 from $15. At a recent price of $7.55, this creates a huge upside potential of 72%.Federal Realty Investment (NYSE: FRT) is another retail REIT, based in North Bethesda, MD. Federal Realty Investment was established in 1962 and is a member of the S&amp;P 500. The REIT owns and operates 105 retail stores in grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use retail centers.Federal Realty prides itself on having the longest record of annual dividend rate increases among U.S. REITs. The 52-week price range is $86.50 to $140.51. Just like RPT Realty, it is currently sitting near its 52-week low and seems to be in a serious downtrend.However, Milligan continues to see value in the stock. He also maintained a Strong Buy on Federal Realty, even while lowering the price target from $140 to $130. Therefore, from its recent price of $88, the analyst’s view would be that Federal Realty now has an upside potential of 47.7%. That’s a lot of ground to make up, but with its long-standing history, an annual dividend of $4.32 and yield of 4.7%, this REIT could be a long-term winner. However, investors may want to see some price stability first.Story continuesSimon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) is one of the largest and most well-known retail REITs. Simon owns and manages shopping centers and premier outlet malls in 37 states and Puerto Rico. It also owns properties in Asia, Canada and Europe. The Indianapolis-based REIT is a member of the S&amp;P 100.Simon Property Group stock dropped significantly in the 2020 COVID-19 market crash, declining from $128 in January to less than $37 by the end of March. Investors who stayed the course were rewarded when SPG rebounded to $161 by November 2021. However, since then, the stock has again languished due to inflation and recessionary concerns. The stock is hitting new lows for the year.Regardless, Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley recently maintained his Overweight position on Simon, while slightly lowering the target price from $133 to $131. This represents about a 51% potential upside from Simon’s recent price of $86.75. Given the REIT’s history of rebounding, and an annual dividend of $7.00 that yields 7.5%, Simon Property Group could be a substantial bargain at this level.Check out: This Little Known REIT Has Produced Double-Digit Annual Returns For The Past Five YearsPlease bear in mind that analysts’ opinions are not always correct, and the best analysts are only right about half the time. Investors should therefore perform their own due diligence when making decisions about what stocks to buy, and simply use the price targets as a guide.Latest Private Market Real Estate Insights:Arrived Homes expanded its offerings to include shares in short-term rental properties with a minimum investment of $100. The platform has already funded over 160 single-family rentals valued at over $60 million.The Flagship Real Estate Fund through Fundrise is up 7.3% year to date and has just added a new rental home community in Charleston, SC to its portfolio.Find more news, insights and offerings on Benzinga Alternative InvestmentsImage by Vintage Tone on ShutterstockSee more from Benzinga3 Health Care REITs With The Highest Upside, According to Analysts3 REITs with the Highest Upside According to AnalystsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The acquisition will add 1,489 water and 1,069 wastewater customers to the company’s existing base of 1.3 million.The aging of crucial water and wastewater infrastructure is concerning for the water industry of the United States. The highly fragmented industry, with its small number of operators and limited financial strength, leads to a delay in investment in essential repairs and upgrades. After completing the acquisition, Illinois American Water has plans to invest nearly $21 million in the first seven years to upgrade the City of Villa Grove’s water and wastewater systems.Why Acquisition is Essential for an Aging and Fragmented IndustryAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, at present, more than 51,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The breaks in the pipeline result in the wastage of 6 billion gallons of potable water each day and add to the loss of water utility operators.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments for the upgrade of infrastructure and the continuation of high-quality services for customers. American Water continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Utilities Continue to ConsolidateAmerican Water Works is expanding its customer base through organic initiatives and acquisitions. It continues to focus on the acquisition of utilities that provide services to 5,000-50,000 customers. As of Jun 30, 2022, through nine acquisitions, the company added 51,000 customers to its existing customer base. AWK’s pending acquisitions (as of Jun 30, 2022), when completed, will add another 29,200 customers to its base. Other water utilities like  SJW Group SJW, Essential Utilities WTRG and California Water Service Group CWT, among others in the water utility space, are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, SJW Group closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to the existing customer base. This has been the fourth Texas acquisition by SJW Group in the past 12 months. In the next five years, SJW Group plans to invest $1.5 billion to further strengthen its infrastructure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SJW Group's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.3% and 8.6%, respectively.In the six years ended Dec 31, 2021, Essential Utilities expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, which, in turn, added 94,000 customers. In the first quarter of 2022, the company completed one buyout, which added 11,000 customers. Essential Utilities plans to invest $3 billion from 2022 through 2024 to fortify operations and efficiently serve the expanding customer base.Utilities’ long-term earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 6.6%, respectively.California Water Service recently received approval to acquire the water system assets of Skylonda Mutual Water Company. The buyout is scheduled to close later this year, subject to customary closing conditions. In April 2022, another unit of California Water Service, New Mexico Water Service, closed the acquisition of Morningstar Water System, which added 2,000 water connections.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for California Water Service's 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 12.3%.

With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Alliant Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Alliant Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Alliant Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Alliant Energy. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Alliant Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Alliant Energy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Alliant EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Alliant Energy Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$22m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Alliant Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Alliant Energy is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is concerning...Ultimately the future is most important.

Fundamentally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that his top priority is controlling inflation. What’s more, Powell made good on his statements, with the central bank raising the benchmark interest rate.Moving forward, it’s not so much about the rate hike itself (up 0.75%) that matters. Instead, it’s all about intentions. Essentially, the Fed will do whatever it takes to get inflation under control. If that means constantly raising rates until the target is achieved, that is what will happen. Naturally, stocks to sell became a hot topic — and not just for the retail segment.However, retail does garner a disproportionate amount of the negative spotlight because people can always cut back on discretionary spending. Therefore, investors will want to be extra cautious about the following stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNKENike$96.36ADDYYAdidas$63.64BURLBurlington$120.71GPSGap$8.49ROSTRoss Stores$84.68VFCVF Corp$35.99BBBYBed Bath &amp; Beyond$6.72Nike (NKE)a stack of red Nike shoe boxesSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.comAn iconic American athletic apparel and equipment manufacturer, Nike (NYSE:NKE) enjoyed a substantial rise higher following the spring doldrums of 2020. However, shares hit a peak in November 2021, coincidentally at the same time that the cryptocurrency sector hit a wall. No, neither NKE nor digital assets have much to do with each other. However, with risk-on sentiment fading, Nike dropped badly just like cryptos.Investors don’t need to do much digging to understand why some folks peg the apparel giant as one of the stocks to sell. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis through Sept. 22, shares plunged 40%. Additionally, near-term dynamics don’t seem to bode well for NKE, dipping 11% in the trailing month.Story continuesFinancially, the company’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 earnings report presented some warning signs. Revenue came in at $12.2 billion, which was about 1% below the year-ago quarter. This performance may reflect that consumer sentiment for discretionary items (like sportswear) peaked.Adidas (ADDYY)Adidas Sign On Adidas Shoe BoxSource: 2p2play / Shutterstock.comNike’s sworn rival Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) isn’t doing much better, suggesting that investors should consider it one of the stocks to sell. It’s an uncomfortable topic, but all you have to do is to look at the charts. Since the start of this year, ADDYY tanked 55%. Over the trailing month, we’re looking at a loss of 15%.Fundamentally, Adidas faces the challenges associated with transitioning from the pandemic lockdown-related paradigm. As the Washington Post once stated during the initial onslaught of the coronavirus, society incurred a pajama moment. Now, it’s time to go back to work — in the office. As Fortune stated, upper management presently is winning the return-to-office battle.Similar to Nike, Adidas appears to be suffering from peak revenue associated with pandemic-fueled catalysts. In the company’s latest quarterly report, Adidas for the three months ended June 2022 generated revenue of $5.92 billion. This was down 3.3% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.Burlington (BURL)photo of a Burlington coat factory storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBurlington (NYSE:BURL), which formerly operated under the name Burlington Coat Factory, is an American national off-price department store retailer. Fundamentally, you might imagine that such retailers might perform well during inflationary cycles. Those seeking a discount from the erosion of purchasing power own an incentive to seek off-price solutions.However, the market, unfortunately, did not receive the memo. BURL shares slipped more than 57% YTD. What’s worse, the nearer-term picture does not provide room for contrarian encouragement. Over the trailing month, BURL gave up nearly 23% of market value. This performance aligns with other retail-related stocks to sell.As with the two athletic apparel giants above, Burlington may be suffering from peak revenue. In the quarter ended July 2022, the discount apparel retailer generated revenue of $1.99 billion. This figure fell more than 10% against the year-ago level. With the Fed’s Jerome Powell acknowledged that the pivot to hawkish monetary policy may yield a rough landing, it’s better to stay on the sidelines for a company with diminished sales prospects.Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockAkin to other retail segment stocks to sell in the apparel space, Gap (NYSE:GPS) lacks credibility. Fundamentally, the issue stems from a redundancy problem. With so many companies both public and private offering premium-level fashion, it’s tough to compete. Add in the economic challenges and also vagaries and you have a tough situation for Gap stakeholders.Here, the market does most of the talking. Since the January opener, GPS shares slipped nearly 52%. On a trailing month basis, GPS declined by more than 12%. Sadly, it’s not a great look. Moreover, Gap did not make Fintel’s list of the most heavily shorted securities. Awkwardly, then, GPS is bad, but not bad enough to be good — if that makes sense.The other factor that makes Gap one of the stocks to sell is financial performance. For the quarter ended July 2022, the apparel retailer generated revenue of $3.86 billion. This figure came in 8.4% below the year-ago period. Unfortunately, it seems that the company has run out of its post-Covid-19 fuel, making GPS one of the stocks to sell ahead of the holiday season.Ross Stores (ROST)Retail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Ross Stores (ROST)Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comWith Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), I can go either way. It’s true that on a YTD basis, ROST dropped more than 23% of market value. While I don’t want to engage in equities-level whataboutisms, Ross is performing better on a comparative basis than other stocks to sell.Further, the fundamentals of the company present an attractive profile. With many corporate employees potentially headed back to the office, they may need to upgrade their wardrobes. But with economic rumblings, these folks may prefer off-price retailers.Nevertheless, Ross Stores isn’t exactly a shining star. During the trailing half-year period ended July 2022, the company posted revenue of about $8.92 billion. In the year-ago cycle, Ross posted sales of $9.32 billion, reflecting roughly a 4% decline.Put another way, similar to other stocks to sell, Ross appears to have incurred peak revenue. As well, net income in the quarter ended July 2022 suffered a 22% decline. It’s just not in the best of shape heading into the holidays.VF Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comA global apparel and footwear company, VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) might seem like an off-putting idea for stocks to sell. Mainly, that’s because the company features brands like Jansport and The North Face. Both cater to winter sports and, by logical deduction, to a wealthier consumer base. Winter sports simply require more gear than, say, kicking a soccer ball around.Sure enough, VF Corp financially outperforms many other stocks to sell in the broader apparel segment. For the quarter ended June 2022 (actually, July 2 if you want to be precise), VF posted revenue of $2.26 billion. This represents a more than 3% lift from the year-ago quarter.However, the company’s operating income in the most recent quarter came out to $63 million. In sharp contrast, one year prior, VF posted operating income of $203 million. To me, this represents an early sign that even the wealthy may be tightening their wallets.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)bed bath &amp; beyond storefront (BBBY)Source: ShutterstockA retailer of various household goods, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) represents a controversial idea among stocks to sell. Earlier, BBBY garnered attention as a possible meme-trade opportunity. However, that concept came crumbling down.It’s difficult to know where to start with the troubled retailer. In August, much was made about activist investor Ryan Cohen bidding up BBBY call options. Soon after the disclosure, though, Cohen dumped shares, cratering the company’s market value.At the end of August, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond filed to sell shares to raise cash. Of course, the measure represents dilution and, not surprisingly, BBBY cratered again. Shortly thereafter, the company’s CFO passed away under distressing circumstances.I can mention that BBBY stock dropped 53% for the year. I can also mention the financial performance, which is poor and worsening. But then, I would merely be piling on at that point. It’s not a technical term but BBBY has bad juju all over it. I wouldn’t buy it, I wouldn’t short it, I would simply stay away.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
