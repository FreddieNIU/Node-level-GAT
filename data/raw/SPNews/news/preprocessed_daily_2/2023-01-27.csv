I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the ""Notice regarding forward-looking statements"" contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.First, you likely saw last week we announced that Haviv Ilan will become President and CEO on April 1st and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll want to join me in congratulating both of them. Secondly, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. Next week on Thursday, February 2nd, at 10:00 a.m. Central time, we will have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insights into our business and our approach to capital allocation. This will include an update of our 300 millimeter capacity expansion plans to support the increasing confidence that we have in our long-term growth. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates.First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I will then provide an annual summary of our revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for first quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview. Revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of 11% sequentially and 3% from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. A component of the weaker demand was customers working to reduce their inventories. In first quarter, we expect a weaker than seasonal decline, with the exception of automotive, as we believe customers will continue to reduce inventory levels.Story continuesTurning to our segments, fourth quarter Analog revenue declined 5% year-over-year and Embedded Processing grew 10%. Our Other segment declined 11% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. I'll focus on sequential performance again this quarter, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down about 10%. The automotive market was up mid-single digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-teens with broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down about 20%, and finally, enterprise systems was down about 20%. Lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2022. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics.The six end markets are industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for 2022, industrial was 40%, automotive about 25%, personal electronics 20%, communications equipment 7%, enterprise systems 6%, and other was 2%. In 2022, industrial and automotive combined made up 65% of TI's revenue, up about three percentage points from 2021 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient.Photo by Towfiqu barbhuiya on UnsplashThese trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?Rafael Lizardi: Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 66% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 320 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $863 million, up 9% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $48 million in the fourth quarter and were associated with the LFAB factory preproduction costs. As production started at the beginning of December, these costs then transitioned to cost of revenue, where they will be reflected moving forward.In addition, depreciation has begun on these assets. Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 47% of revenue. Operating profit was down 13% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion, or $2.13 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.11 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.0 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $848 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners.We also increased our dividend per share by 8% in the fourth quarter, marking our 19th year of dividend increases. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. In the quarter we issued $800 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.93%. Inventory was up $353 million from the prior quarter to $2.8 billion, and days were 157, up 24 days sequentially. Next, to summarize the benefits of the CHIPS Act, we accrued about $350 million on our balance sheet under long-term assets in fourth quarter, in addition to the $50 million accrued in third quarter. These accruals are due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories.This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2022, cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, or 14% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2022 was $5.9 billion, or 30% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.90. We now expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%.In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.Dave Pahl: Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?Operator: Thank you. We'll first hear from Chris Caso of Credit Suisse.Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess, the first question is, if you could just maybe characterize what you're seeing going to Q1, you're talking about that being worse than seasonal. Is that also broadly based in terms of the decline as you've seen in Q4? And I know you don't guide by segment, but any kind of color you could provide by segment as to what you're seeing and the extent to which customers are burning inventory as you know into the first quarter?See also 25 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military Power and 10 Most Advanced Battery Technologies.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84.The company’s net sales in the fourth quarter were $5,230.5 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,244.9 million. Net sales increased around 9.8% from $4,762.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by higher selling prices in all segments and increased architectural sales volumes in the Americas Group segment, which were partly mitigated by lower sales volumes in the company’s Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group outside of North America.The SherwinWilliams Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe SherwinWilliams Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe SherwinWilliams Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The SherwinWilliams Company QuoteSegment HighlightsThe Americas Group: Net sales from this segment were $3,071.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 15.7% from the year-ago quarter. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume for architectural business in most end markets. Profit increased as higher prices and a rise in paint sales volumes were partially offset by high raw materials cost and high SG&amp;A expense in the quarter.Consumer Brands Group: Net sales from this segment were $551.5 million in the fourth quarter, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. High raw materials cost, supply chain disruptions and adverse currency movements drove the profit of this segment down. The segment also faced headwinds from cost incurred due to restructuring and lower sales volume, which were partly offset by higher selling prices and effective cost controls.Performance Coatings Group: Net sales from this segment were $1,607.4 million in the fourth quarter, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The upside was mainly supported by higher selling prices in all end markets but was partly offset by lower sales volume in APAC and EMEAI regions. Higher raw materials cost and increased costs resulting from supporting sales partly mitigated the rise in segment profits.Story continuesFY22 ResultsEarnings for full-year 2022 were $7.72 per share compared with $6.98 a year ago. Net sales increased 11.1% year over year to $22,148.9 million.FinancialsAt the end of the fourth quarter, Sherwin-Williams had cash and cash equivalents of $198.8 million, up around 20% year over year. Long-term debt increased approximately 11.6% to $9,591 million.Sherwin-Williams generated $1.92 billion in net operating cash during 2022. The company also repurchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock during the year.OutlookMoving ahead, SHW sees a challenging demand environment in 2023. The company expects its architectural and some industrial businesses to remain under pressure due to the slowdown of U.S. housing market. Rising inflation is also expected to dent the company’s performance. Further, the company expects slowing economic conditions in Europe and uncertainties in China due to the pandemic along with the slowdown in the United States, as witnessed in some sectors, to affect its industrial business.The company expects consolidated net sales growth to be flat to up a mid-single-digit percentage year over year in first-quarter 2023. For full-year 2023, it envisions consolidated net sales to be down a mid-single-digit percentage to flat compared to the year-ago level.Sherwin-Williams also sees earnings in the range of $6.79-$7.59 per share for full-year 2023.

The insurer delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 34.9%.Factors to NoteThe Unum U.S. segment is likely to have benefited from favorable benefits experience in group product lines and higher premium income, partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter premium income at the Unum U.S. segment is pegged at $1.6 billion, implying an improvement of 3.5% from the prior-year reported figure.Favorable benefits experience, higher premium income, in-force block growth and higher sales are likely to have favored performance at Colonial Life. The upside is likely to be partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter premium income at the Colonial Life segment stands at $434 million, indicating an increase of 2.6% from the prior-year level.Growth in the in-force block, resulting from the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line and higher persistency are likely to have benefited Unum International in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter premium income at the Unum International segment stands at $173 million.Decline in the yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income are likely to have weighed on net investment income. This downside may have been partially offset by higher level of invested assets and higher investment income from inflation index-linked bonds held by Unum UK. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $517 million, indicating a 6.2% decline from the prior-year quarter. We expect net investment income to be $519.6 million.Expenses are likely to have increased because of higher commissions, interest and debt expense, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and compensation expense. We expect total benefits and expenses to be $2.6 billion.A continued share buyback is likely to have provided a boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.46, indicating an increase of 64% from the year-ago reported figure.

State Street is consolidating its current network of segregated data center facilities to a more optimized data center footprint with fit-for-purpose designed and managed facilities.Through this transformation, State Street will modernize and standardize its technology infrastructure, leveraging automation and a combination of private cloud and public cloud capabilities. This hybrid and hyperconverged model combines all the elements of a traditional data center (storage, compute, networking and management) and will allow State Street to host workloads across private or public environments to optimize agility, performance, and scalability. This model will enable accelerated migration and modernization of applications, with the flexibility to accommodate strategic integrations.As part of its ongoing technology transformation journey, State Street’s focus on modernization through the facility, infrastructure, and application stack will increase resiliency, enable rapid business product innovation, and deliver enhanced customer experiences. To advance its strategy and accelerate its technology transformation, State Street has entered into strategic engagements with leading cloud providers.State Street selected AWS as one of its strategic cloud providers and plans to transition its two core North American data centers to AWS, while also maintaining operations in these data centers for a period of time as its technology transformation journey continues to evolve. The data center transition provides a path for State Street to rapidly modernize the IT infrastructure layers that a pure public cloud strategy does not address.Story continuesBuilding on the successful implementation and use of the Microsoft® Azure cloud, previously announced in December 2020, State Street will expand its use of Azure as a platform for business applications. State Street will further leverage the Microsoft Azure platform across the enterprise to augment its technology infrastructure, standardize platforms and accelerate technology development.Architecting and implementing a highly resilient, flexible data center and cloud architecture is central to State Street’s strategy.

Launched on January 22, 1993, SPY is the world’s largest ETF with more than $355 billion in assets and the most heavily traded security in the world with an average daily trading volume of $39 billion.*""SPY gave birth to an industry that has democratized investing, giving both investors large and small access to institutional-grade solutions that offer efficient, cost-effective exposures to all corners of the global investment market,"" said Rory Tobin, head of State Street Global Advisors’ Global SPDR ETF Business. ""Born out of the stock market crash of 1987, SPY has demonstrated its resilience throughout major market events from the burst of the dot-com bubble to the global financial crisis of 2008, and more recently, the extreme pandemic-era volatility.""""SPY disrupted the asset management industry and benefitted investors in ways that exceeded even the most ambitious expectations,"" said Sue Thompson head of SPDR Americas Distribution at State Street Global Advisors. ""Three decades since SPY’s launch, investors now have access to more than 8,000 ETFs globally, but none come close to offering the liquidity of SPY, which provides transaction cost benefits that can lower total cost of ownership for investors.""Story continues""S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices congratulates State Street Global Advisors on this momentous occasion. This 30-year milestone and the tremendous growth of ETFs during this time, reflect the transformational benefits being provided to all end investors,"" said Dan Draper, Chief Executive Officer at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.A History Steeped in Liquidity &amp; ResiliencySince SPY’s launch, US-listed ETFs have amassed $6.5 trillion in assets.*Toward the end of 2022 SPY was trading three times more than Apple (AAPL) — the largest security in the world by market cap.** That volume, combined with the size of SPY’s assets, performance, liquidity, and resilience, has been vital to investors as they construct asset allocation portfolios and navigate extreme market events.In fact, as the market began to tumble during the onset of COVID-19, SPY became the first ETF to ever trade more than $100 billion in a single day on February 28, 2020.**""Throughout each market turn, SPY’s unparalleled liquidity profile provided investors with the flexibility to buy and sell shares quickly, easily, and cost-efficiently,"" Tobin added.ETF Impact Survey shows the positive impact ETFs have on investors todayToday, ETFs have become core building blocks for investors making asset allocation decisions. The expansion of ETFs to include different types of funds in a variety of asset classes further added to their appeal.Recent findings from State Street Global Advisors ETF Impact Survey reaffirm the popularity of ETFs as a vehicle that can help investors remain confident in their investing acumen. The survey was designed to understand investor attitudes and perceptions about ETFs, the market and the economy in the US, APAC and EMEA.Overall, the perceived benefits ETFs have brought to investors globally is overwhelmingly positive- whether or not they even own ETFs. More than half agree ETFs are an investor-friendly investment product (58%) and are better diversified than other investment products (54%).Furthermore, investors who do have an existing ETF holding report that ETFs have improved the overall performance of their portfolio (73% globally and 59% in the US alone). And, the majority believe ETFs have made them a better investor (67% globally and 53% in the US).Liquidity Remains Important Amidst Investor Uncertainty on Markets and EconomyGlobally, nearly seven-in-ten investors believe the volatility in the stock market is going to continue for at least the next 12 months. Six-in-ten investors agree that when there is volatility in the market it is important to have more liquid investments.Regardless of whether they have ETFs in their portfolio, globally, more than half of investors agree ETFs offer more liquidity to respond rapidly to market changes (52%) and can mitigate risk better in volatile markets compared to other investments (51%).More Room for Growth and InnovationDespite the explosive growth of the ETF industry since SPY’s launch, the survey suggests the industry still has a long runway for expansion in the US, as just 40% of investors say they own an ETF in their portfolio, which is considerably lower than stocks (83%), mutual funds (67%) and bonds (53%). When asked if they plan to buy ETFs in the next 12 months, 50% of investors globally indicate they do, compared to 37% in the US.About State Street Global Advisors’ ETF Impact Survey, November - December 2022State Street Global Advisors, in partnership with A2Bplanning and Prodege, conducted an online survey among individual investors in the US, EMEA (UK, Switzerland, Netherlands, Israel) and APAC (Singapore, Japan, Australia).

(NYSE:TMO) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-thermo-fisher-scientific-120033382.html,1674820833,STORY,['TMO'],"[Let's talk about the popular Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Thermo Fisher Scientific’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 32.35x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 31.44x, which means if you buy Thermo Fisher Scientific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Thermo Fisher Scientific should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Furthermore, Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward.Can we expect growth from Thermo Fisher Scientific?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 28%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TMO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TMO? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TMO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Following their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.Andy Cecere: Thanks George. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank on December 1st. In the fourth quarter, we reported $0.57 per diluted share or $1.20 after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. This was a complex quarter that included one month of Union Bank results, merger integration charges, and balance sheet optimization activity. Terry will provide more details on these notable items. Importantly, we ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.4%, which was just above our expected level at deal close and we delivered positive operating leverage for U.S. Bancorp legacy operations of 230 basis points for the full year.Story continuesStrong year-over-year pre-tax provision income growth as adjusted for notable items was driven by net interest income growth and positive operating leverage. Credit quality remains strong, although credit metrics are starting to normalize as expected. Slide four details are reported and adjusted income statement results as well as end-of-period balances and other performance metrics. End-of-period assets for the company totaled $675 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Union Bank and certain balance sheet optimization actions. Slide five highlights key performance ratios. This quarter, we delivered a return on average assets of 1.2%, a return of average common equity of 16.8%, and a return on tangible common equity of 23.4%, each as adjusted for notable items.Turning to slide six. The completion of the Union Bank acquisition marked a significant milestone for our company. With double-digit percent increases in loan and deposit balances, Union Bank adds meaningful scale to our business that enables us to better serve our customers and communities. Union contributes considerable small business and consumer market share in a demographically attractive California market, and we're excited about the potential to deepen existing Union Bank relationships by overlaying our leading digital capabilities and robust product set, including wealth management, consumer and business banking and payments offerings across a loyal but under-penetrated consumer base. In many ways, this deal underscores our commitment to creating a stronger, more competitive regional banking organization in a rapidly evolving environment.One of the more attractive aspects of this transaction is Union Bank's high quality, low cost consumer deposit franchise, which will support continued loan growth and margins. Let me turn the call over now to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter.Terry Dolan: Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 7, as Andy mentioned, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter or $1.20 per share after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. Notable items related to Union Bank acquisition are comprised of three primary elements that reduced earnings per share by $0.63 related to balance sheet optimization, merger and integration costs, and the impacts of -- on provision expense related to acquired loans and actions taken to optimize the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, the company recognized a one-time $399 million pre-tax loss on a net basis related to several actions taken to optimize the balance sheet, manage the interest rate volatility impact on capital levels and position the company for future growth.Subsequent to obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, we entered into interest rate hedges to manage rate volatility and its related impact on regulatory capital from the date of approval through the closing of the transaction in December. During that time frame, long-term interest rates increased nearly 50 basis points before declining approximately 65 basis points. The interest rate swaps were terminated at the time of closing, and the losses recognized through earnings largely offset the interest rate marks recorded into the balance sheet through purchase accounting. In addition, the company optimized its balance sheet by selling certain loans and repositioning its investment portfolio on certain equity investments. Within non-interest expenses, we incurred merger and integration related charges of $90 million that primarily included the impact of specific deal closing costs, professional services and employee related expenses.We also incurred a $791 million charge to the provision for credit losses, which reflects an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and a net loss of $129 million related to the securitization of approximately $4 billion of legacy indirect auto loans. Again, these moves enabled us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns. Slide 8 provides a more detailed earnings summary. Union Bank, which was included in our consolidated results for one month, contributed $302 million of revenue, $221 million of non-interest expenses, $81 million of operating income and $44 million of net income to the company, representing $0.03 per diluted share. On slide 9, end of period loans increased 13.3% on a linked-quarter basis to $388 billion, which included core loan growth and acquired loans from Union Bank.Union Bank contributed ending loan balances of $54 billion net of purchase accounting adjustments, partly offset by a reduction in balances of $15 billion related to balance sheet optimization actions, including loan sales and securitizations. Slide 10 provides end-of-period deposit balance composition. End-of-period deposits increased 11.4% on a linked-quarter basis to $525 billion driven by the acquisition, which contributed $86 billion of lower-cost deposits, and actions taken as a result of the deal to optimize our funding sources. On a core basis, we saw deposit balances decline slightly this quarter. Turning to slide 11. The investment securities portfolio grew 4.2% linked quarter to $170 billion. The addition of securities from Union Bank were offset by balance sheet optimization actions.Slide 12 highlights revenue trends. Adjusted net revenue totaled $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which included revenue contribution of $302 million from Union Bank, primarily representing net interest income. For legacy US Bancorp, net interest income grew 5.5% on a linked-quarter basis and 29.2% year-over-year driven by strong earning asset growth and net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates. Results were partially offset by higher deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs. Non-interest income, as adjusted for the legacy company, declined 3.0% compared to the third quarter driven by seasonally lower payment service revenue and lower commercial product revenue, offset by stronger mortgage banking revenue.Year-over-year, legacy adjusted non-interest income declined 5.5% driven by lower mortgage banking revenue from reduced refinancing activity and lower servicing charges, offset by stronger payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees. Turning to slide 13. Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter, including $221 million from Union Bank. Included in expenses was approximately $42 million of intangible amortization due to core deposit intangibles established at the time of the acquisition. Legacy non-interest expense, as adjusted, increased 3.8% on a linked-quarter basis largely driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as higher expenses related to professional services, marketing, technology and tax credit amortization.Slide 14 shows credit quality trends. We reported total net charge-offs for the quarter of $578 million. After adjusting for acquisition impacts and the balance sheet optimization activities, net charge-offs totaled $210 million or 0.23% of average loans, up from 0.19% in the third quarter, which reflected the continuing normalization of credit losses. Non-performing assets for the legacy bank increased slightly, while Union Bank contributed $329 million to the total. On a combined basis, the reported ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.26% at December 31, compared with 0.20% at September 30, and 0.28% a year ago, reflecting a continued strong credit quality. The provision for credit losses was $1.19 billion, which included a provision of $791 million related to the acquisition and balance sheet optimization activities.This provision includes an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and $129 million related to our balance sheet optimization activities. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31st totaled $7.4 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans, which reflects increased economic uncertainty and the incorporation of the Union Bank portfolio. Slide 15 highlights the drivers of our linked-quarter common equity Tier 1 capital position. As of December 31st, our CET1 capital ratio was 8.4%. Acquisition impacts of 180 basis points included an increase in goodwill and other intangible assets that reflected the impact of credit and interest rate marks, the initial provision for credit losses, balance sheet optimization actions, as well as the increase in risk-weighted assets with the addition of Union Bank.These impacts were partially offset by an increase to equity related to shares issued to MUFG as part of the purchase price of Union Bank. Slide 16 provides our current expectations of certain financial metrics related to the transaction. The financial and strategic merits of the deal remain intact and are very attractive. Earnings per share accretion is now expected to be 8% to 9% in 2023, which is higher than originally estimated. While our tangible book value per share dilution is higher than initially estimated due to the significant impact of rising interest rates on the interest rate marks at close, our estimated earn-back period is only slightly longer than our original estimate at two years versus our original estimate of 1.5 years.BankSlide 17 provides a comparison of credit and net fair value marks from the time of our announcement to closing. Credit marks are lower due to favorable changes in portfolio composition and credit quality, partially offset by economic deterioration. Interest rate marks, inclusive of loans, securities net of sales, and debt, are higher than anticipated at announcement due to higher interest rates, but we expect that to accrete quickly back through earnings. The core deposit intangible is also higher than originally estimated, reflecting the increased value of lower-cost core deposits in a higher rate environment. I will now provide first quarter and full year 2023 forward-looking guidance, which is provided on slide 18, starting with the first quarter 2023 guidance.We expect average earning assets of between $605 million and $610 billion in the first quarter and the net interest margin that is five to 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter level. Total revenue is estimated to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, including approximately $100 million of purchase accounting accretion during the quarter.

We continue to target a Memorial Day weekend systems conversion, incorporating a lift-and-shift approach to our applications, which mitigates risk and allows us to more quickly capture meaningful cost synergies. There is still a tremendous amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and we are preparing for any scenario. I believe we will perform well because of the strength of our business, a strong balance sheet and the great team we have.As we've proven during previous economic downturns, our business model is resilient and recession ready in large part due to our disciplined through the cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. Our consumer clients are predominantly prime, super prime, and our commercial book is generally investment grade, and we have very little leverage lending commitments. We are focused on prudent balance sheet growth, high return, high margin opportunities and the prudent allocation of capital to lines of business and products best served to deliver on our strategic objectives. Our growth strategy is focused on creating value for our customers, communities and shareholders, which allow us to generate industry leading performance.Let me close by saying thank you to our 77,000 employees across the company, including our newest colleagues from Union Bank.

23,9cba43ba-6dee-34b3-9d6e-8d21be979080,USB,2023-01-27,U.S. Bancorp (USB) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-top-dividend-164504516.html,1674751504,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.U.S. Bancorp in FocusU.S. Bancorp (USB) is headquartered in Minneapolis, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 12.7% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.48 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.91%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.63%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8.58%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, U.S. Bancorp's payout ratio is 44%, which means it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.USB is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.94 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.01%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Additionally, what items should shoppers avoid and which items should they purchase at other stores?Whether you are an avid Walmart shopper or just pop in from time to time, these Walmart hacks offer everyone a glimpse into how Walmart operates and how to make your next trip a smoother and more budget-friendly experience.Walmart1. Use the Walmart AppOne of the greatest secrets to saving money at Walmart is using the Walmart app. The app allows shoppers to scan their items while in-store and the opportunity to look up the items online. By doing a quick item search, most shoppers will find that many items are listed for less online and they can save money by making a simple price adjustment.""Many times a scanned price will show up for less money,"" said Jodie Filogromo, founder of Jodie's Touch of Style, which shares how to get great deals on clothes and other items. ""However, then you want to get a sales associate to have them change the price for you before you go up to the cashier.""Take Our Poll: Are You In Favor of More Inflation Relief in 2023?Icatnews / Shutterstock.com2. Buy Walmart's Private LabelsWalmart owns its own private labels that allow consumers to find lesser-priced items that are comparable to name-brand items. Several popular Walmart brands to look for include Great Value, Mainstays and Equate. Great Value items can be found in the grocery section, Mainstays can be found in bedding, kitchen items and furniture and Equate can be found in the pharmacy and health and beauty section. Be sure to look for the Walmart brand of the item you are looking for next time you shop to enjoy more savings.Story continuesSanyaSM / Getty Images3. Use Walmart's Curbside Pick-Up for GroceriesWhen it comes to shopping at Walmart, efficiency is key. For guests who want to avoid crowds during busy hours or simply do not have the time to navigate through the store to pick out the items they need, Walmart offers curbside grocery delivery.""Use Walmart's free online shopping service and order groceries for pick-up,"" said Karen Zerbini, content creator and founder of Supper Sanity, a meal-planning blog that allows families to eat healthy, homemade meals while saving money. ""This service helps you to purchase only the groceries that you need. You save time and money. Drive up to the designated area in the parking lot, and a Walmart employee will load your groceries.""Shoppers can take advantage of this option by ordering groceries ahead through the Walmart app or shopping online.2018 Walmart Inc.4. Opt for In-Store PickupAnother free perk Walmart offers that shoppers should be aware of is the store's free-pickup option. Walmart offers free shipping for any online order over $35. However, if you just need one item and don't want to pay for shipping or want your item right away, in-store pickup is a great option. In-store pickup also allows shoppers to avoid the crowds in the store, take advantage of online prices and make their shopping more efficient.Photointoto / Shutterstock.com5. Buy on the First Day of SalesIn order to get the best deals, it is important to be aware of sales every week, not just on Black Friday. Shoppers can stay on top of sales by visiting the website or the app to see what's on sale for the week. One great way to save the most money is by buying on the first day of the sale. Stores want to get the highest return on the first day of a sale, so the first day of a sale often offers the best deals and allows shoppers to save more.Matej Kastelic / Shutterstock.com6. Shop the Clearance RackThe most basic way to save money during your Walmart shopping is by buying clearance products. Walmart has a habit of hiding clearance items and it's helpful for shoppers to be aware of some simple hacks to find clearance items more easily.Shoppers should check out the day-old bread rack for bakery deals and aisle end caps for hidden clearance items. Additionally, Walmart tends to keep more clearance items in-store out of reach by keeping them in glass cases, so be sure to check out what's inside those cases when you are shopping. Walmart shoppers can also easily check if an item they need is on sale by checking online before buying.Filipovic018 / Getty Images/iStockphoto7. Be Wary of Purchasing AppliancesWhen it comes to appliance shopping at Walmart, experts recommend shopping with great caution.Walmart often contracts with companies that create less expensive versions of appliances with cheaper materials. This allows Walmart to buy items from manufacturers for cheap and sell to consumers at a lower price point than competitors. However, it leaves consumers with an inferior product costing only slightly less than higher-quality name-brand appliances. When it comes to appliance purchasing, it is better to buy from Home Depot, Best Buy or other appliance-focused retailers.arinahabich / iStock.com8. Buy These 3 Items at Walmart for Major SavingsWhen it comes to choosing what items to buy at Walmart instead of at other stores, experts recommend purchasing dried spices, cereals and school supplies at Walmart every time.Great Value offers a wide variety of spices that allows customers to purchase spices for as little as 98 cents a bottle. The Walmart house brand offers generic and organic spice options that are less expensive than the name brand. The store also offers a vast array of cereals in huge bags that allow customers to buy in bulk. However, it might be helpful to put the cereal in a container for storage purposes. Finally, during back-to-school season, Walmart offers unbeatable school supply prices with notebooks for as little as 25 cents.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 8 Secret Walmart Shopping Hacks]"

EPS came in at $2.29, a penny better than estimates, while net revenue came up just short.Let's discuss the quarter and what's ahead for the economy in an exclusive interview with Paul Reilly, Raymond James CEO. Great to have you, sir. Really appreciate the time. We saw what investors think there of the quarter. What about yourself?PAUL REILLY: Well, Dave, thank-- it's great to be on the show. Had a very, very strong quarter. I don't think many firms projected records this quarter, which we did have a record return to shareholders. And our largest business-- our private client group business had record revenue, record profits, led the industry by far with almost 10% net new assets. I'd say double over the top performers. So we thought it was very, very solid.I think the question investors had is we're very open and we're conservative. My job is to make sure that this company is a safe haven for clients, our advisors, and shareholders. And we a year ago started talking about the cash crunch when we had record cash in the industry. And we've seen now with rates going up and clients, as advisor should have them do, moving to high-yield types of investment instruments, and we haven't done any. Most of our competitors have been very aggressively raising higher-cost deposits. We haven't. And we announced that we are going to start to do that. We started off with a lot more liquidity, so didn't have to. But if it continues, we are going to roll out the programs and make sure that we have ample cash to operate on.So I don't know if we weren't-- did as good of a job of communicating that we didn't have infinite amount of free cash. No one does. The whole industry has seen this whole movement, and it's probably impacted us last. But, again, we're in it for the long run. So we've had a great run in share price and valuation, and if we have a blip, that's OK. We just have to keep performing.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Paul, I know you're in it for the long run, but the next 12 to 18 months, it really seems to be the big focus among many investors recently. I know you set aside some loan provisions here for credit losses potentially going forward. When you talk about that macroeconomic picture within that shorter time frame, how much worse do you see it potentially getting?PAUL REILLY: You know, Seana, that's kind of the, I guess, multitrillion-dollar question for the industry is I don't know if we've ever seen a time like this where we saw rates go from prolonged near zero to raise so quickly, even though historically not high rates. So the movement of cash, I don't think anyone knows. We all can use our models and say how much. I don't think we've ever had the consumer so loaded. So much cash in the system, not just in banks but in nonbanking institutions, which drove a lot of the runs in the last year or two years in M&amp;A and other activity. We've had a lot of people leave the workforce. I don't know if that's permanent or negative due to those cash build ups, both from government programs during COVID.And so when that all unwinds, we don't know, right? So here our view is we'll look at the long run, and we don't know, so we're not going to take the bets. We've got well in excess of a billion dollars of extra capital, which we often get criticized for having too much capital. We don't think in an environment like that-- like this that that's-- you know, we should do that.We have excess cash on our corporate balance sheets, and the view is let's see what happens. We're going to find out in the next six months what happens to demand, to supply, to inflation. We hear the debates both sides. You can go on any show and hear-- you know, just listen long enough and you'll hear your point of view because it differs all over, and I don't think we really know.So I think the consumers in relatively good shape. It's going to tighten up. I don't-- you know, if you ask me to guess, I don't think it's going to be a hard landing, probably a soft one, but we don't know. So we're not-- our bet is being flexible and liquid and ride through it as a company until we see the economy turn.DAVE BRIGGS: The era of free money being over, what is going to be the impact for the rest of the year? And do you think the Fed will hold rates where-- after a couple of more hikes, fail to cut rates until '24?PAUL REILLY: I think that-- it's been interesting to me over the last year all these predictions that the Fed wasn't going to cut what they clearly said-- I mean wasn't going to raise what they clearly said they were going to raise every week. And every time there was 75 basis points to go, they're only going to do 25 or 50.I think they've been very clear. I think their strategy has been very clear. I don't think they're worried about the stock market. They're worried about inflation and getting that down. Unemployment's still low, which is going to be the hard part of inflation to get under control. So I think they're going to stick to their guns, and they'll stop when they see signs.So the trends are in the right direction. They're lagging indicators, but I think they're going to wait until they know, so we could have more in front of us. And again, I think even-- you know, we talk about 6% mortgages. I remember when I got my first mortgage. I would have died and thought I went to heaven to get a 6% mortgage.So, you know, when you're used to 3%, 6% is a lot. But when you're used to 9%, you know, it seems historically like a reasonable rate. So as long as it levels out and people get certainty, I think people will start coming back into the market.SEANA SMITH: It's very important to put that in perspective. Paul, what about layoffs? That has obviously been a popular topic among the earnings calls. We've seen the layoffs start to creep in to the financial sector. How are you looking at your current headcount, and do you potentially see the need to adjust that headcount over the next couple of months?PAUL REILLY: Yeah, it's another thing about the way we have governed the firm well even before me is that we tend to have a little lower salaries and higher bonus percentage, just for these periods. We tend to hire as we need. We try to never get in front. So we still have open positions.We did not hire, and we're still growing. If you look at our growth over the last two years, we never hired ahead of that growth. We were always a little behind. So we're in good shape in terms of our employee base. We didn't have the run up. Investment banking isn't the biggest part of our business. It's a very good part and productive part.And so I think we traditionally have not, you know, had layoffs in our history except for very unusual events. Don't anticipate it. And I think a lot of the companies you see in tech and others, they were just-- if you look at the number of people they hired in the last two years-- the layoff numbers seem big, but as a percentage of the people they just hired in the last two years, it's pretty small. So I think there's a reckoning there.There's still a lot of job openings. I think most of those people get re-employed. So I think there's still going to be pressure on the labor force.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I'm looking at your earnings report. Your headcount's only grown about 5% from a year ago. So comparing that against a lot of the companies laying off workers, clearly a different picture.Paul Reilly, great to have you, CEO of Raymond James.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.14 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Marsh &amp; McLennan shares have added about 4.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Marsh &amp; McLennan?While Marsh &amp; McLennan has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marsh &amp; McLennan: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter indicates a 10.7% rise from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for the same indicates an 11.1% rise from the year-ago figure.ITW’s Food Equipment segment’s performance in the fourth quarter is expected to have gained from growth across both North America and International operations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Food Equipment segment revenues suggests a 7% increase from the year-ago reported number.The robust semiconductor business is likely to have benefitted the company’s Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics segment in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics segment indicates a 12.4% rise from the year-ago reported quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect the segment sales to increase 10.9% year over year.Solid equipment and consumables manufacturing operations and industrial business are expected to support the performance of the Welding segment in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Welding segment revenues suggests a 9.7% increase from the year-ago reported number.The company’s December 2021 acquisition of MTS Systems Corporation’s test and simulation business boosted its Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics segment and also augmented its product offerings and technical abilities by expanding its footprint in various end markets. This buyout is expected to have contributed to Illinois Tools’ top-line growth in the fourth quarter.However, weakness in ITW’s Specialty products segment due to reduced demand in the appliance components division is likely to have affected the company’s fourth-quarter margins and profitability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues implies a 1.2% decrease from the year-ago reported number. For the fourth quarter, we expect the same to decrease 1.3% year over year.Also, the rising costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses might have dented ITW’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Given its substantial international presence, foreign-currency headwinds are expected to have affected its top line.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model suggests an earnings beat for ITW this time around.

BetMGM has based forward-looking statements on management's current expectations, assumptions and projections about future events and trends. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, BetMGM's expectations regarding its financial outlook (including forecasted net revenues from operations, EBITDA, and amounts expected to be invested by MGM Resorts and Entain in 2023), projected market share position, and its expected growth in new and existing jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Included among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are: the significant competition within the gaming and entertainment industry; BetMGM's ability to execute on its business plan; changes in applicable laws or regulations, particularly with respect to iGaming and online sports betting; BetMGM's ability to manage growth and access the capital needed to support its growth plans; and BetMGM's ability to obtain the required licenses, permits and other approvals necessary to grow in existing and new jurisdictions. In providing forward-looking statements, BetMGM is not undertaking any duty or obligation to update these statements publicly as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If BetMGM updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those other forward-looking statements.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis press release includes net revenue from operations, which has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. BetMGM believes this presentation, which it uses for its own analysis of operations, is useful in that it reflects the true economic performance of the business. If BetMGM presented net revenue from operations in accordance with GAAP, then BetMGM would present the revenues associated with its Nevada digital and retail sports betting operations differently, until such time as BetMGM is licensed as a Nevada gaming operator. Currently under GAAP, its calculation of Net Revenue would be on a basis net of operating costs, such that the GAAP reported Net Revenue would be lower than the Net Revenue reported herein, with Net Income remaining the same.About BetMGMBetMGM is a market leading sports betting and gaming entertainment company, pioneering the online gaming industry.

55,8548fe29-764b-3bd3-9533-f5a656fa86d3,MCHP,2023-01-27,Microchip Technology (MCHP) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microchip-technology-mchp-earnings-expected-150103529.html,1674745263,STORY,['MCHP'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Microchip Technology (MCHP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +29.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.15 billion, up 22.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Microchip Tech?For Microchip Tech, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microchip Tech will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Microchip Tech would post earnings of $1.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of +1.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Microchip Tech doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He added that OPEC had regained its pricing power and would ensure prices remained elevated.The increase in oil prices projected by Goldman Sachs would represent a 22% rise on current levels of around $81.99 for crude oil.The price of a barrel of oil in the US has dipped more than 33% from highs around $122 reached in June last year, amid an increase in stockpiles and a slowdown in global economic demand.Bhandari also said conversations among investors in Europe had been moving from the effects of a Russian price cap to a Russian product embargo, which will involve the EU banning imports of refined Russian products, such as diesel, naphtha and fuel oil, on February 5.""The fifth of February product embargo could be more disruptive to the product prices, not necessarily crude but to the product prices by way of higher refining margins of diesel,"" Bhandari said.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda will step down from his post on April 1st. Toyota will become the new chairman of the board after serving as the CEO for 13 years. He'll be replaced by the current chief branding officer Koji Sato. Sato has been heading the Toyota Lexus division and the Gazoo Racing Company since 2020.Elon Musk reportedly held talks with investors about raising up to $3 billion to repay some of the debt he accrued from his Twitter purchase. Musk's team reportedly said that if the company is successful with the equity raise, it could be used to pay down an unsecured portion of the debt that carries the highest interest rate within the $13 billion Twitter loan package. All of this, by the way, according to the Wall Street Journal. Paying off that debt would be a huge help to Twitter financially as the company struggles to keep advertisers on the platform.And some Morgan Stanley employees are facing big penalties. The bank is fining workers who conducted business on messaging services like WhatsApp. They're being fined over $1 million, which will be taken from previous bonuses or future paychecks. This is just the latest fallout after an industry-wide probe that resulted in record penalties for the banks for monitoring lapses. Since then, the bank decided to give employees training on scenarios when they should shift conversations from personal devices to official platforms.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this investment bank have returned +13.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.76 per share, indicating a change of -14.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.21 points to a change of +13.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.01 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.1%. The $56.2 billion and $58.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +4.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.84%. The EPS surprise was +4.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analysts have said the EU cap now appears less likely to be triggered, but that price spikes cannot be ruled out.Story continuesThe long-debated EU cap split the bloc's member countries, with Belgium and Poland among those calling for the measure to shield consumers from soaring energy bills, while sceptics including Germany and the Netherlands feared it could disrupt markets.($1 = 0.9185 euros)(Reporting by Kate Abnett; additional reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Nina Chestney and Kirsten Donovan)]"

The pre-event favorites in pairs and ice dance, and now leaders after day one, are all in their 30s.World champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier easily took the largest pairs’ short program lead in nationals history in what may be their last U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, eyeing their fourth U.S. title, put up the biggest gap in a U.S. short dance since its inception in 2011.It’s believed that no pair or dance couple of skaters in their 30s has won a U.S. title in more than 50 years.Knierim and Frazier, who last March became the first U.S. pair to win a world title since 1979, tallied 81.96 points to open the four-day nationals on Thursday.They lead by 15.1 over Emily Chan and Spencer Howe going into Saturday’s free skate in San Jose, California, the largest first-day pairs’ gap since the Code of Points replaced the 6.0 scoring system in 2006.FIGURE SKATING NATIONALS: Full Scores | Broadcast ScheduleThe top three pairs from last year’s event — which Knierim and Frazier missed due to him contracting COVID-19 — are no longer competing together. Knierim and Frazier had a clean skate, while Chan and Howe, who entered as silver medal favorites, counted a fall.After nationals, a committee selects three U.S. pairs for March’s world championships in Japan.Before the fall Grand Prix Series, the 31-year-old Knierim said this will probably be their last season competing together, though the pair also thought they were done last spring. They don’t expect to make a final decision until after a Stars on Ice tour this spring.“I don’t like to just put it out there and say it is the last or not going to be the last because life just has that way of throwing curveballs, and you just never know,” Frazier said this month. “But I would say that this is the first nationals where I’m going to go in really trying to soak up every second as if it is my last because you just don’t know.”Story continuesKnierim is going for a fifth U.S. title, which would tie the record for a pairs’ skater since World War II, joining Kyoka Ina, Tai Babilonia, Randy Gardner, Karol Kennedy and Peter Kennedy. Knierim’s first three titles, and her first Olympics in 2018, were with husband Chris, who retired in 2020.Knierim is also trying to become the first female pairs’ skater in her 30s to win a national title since 1993. Knierim and Chock are trying to become the first female skaters in their 30s to win a U.S. title in any discipline since 1995.After being unable to defend their 2021 U.S. title last year, Knierim and Frazier reeled off a series of historic results in what had long been the country’s weakest discipline.They successfully petitioned for an Olympic spot and placed sixth at the Games, best for a U.S. pair since 2002. They considered retirement after their world title, which was won without the top five teams from the Olympics in attendance. They returned in part to compete as world champions and to give back to U.S. skating, helping set up younger pairs for success.They became the first U.S. pair to win two Grand Prix Series events, then in December became the first U.S. pair to make a Grand Prix Final podium (second place). The world’s top pairs were absent; Russians banned due to the war in Ukraine and Olympic champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong from China leaving competition ice (for now).Knierim and Frazier’s real test isn’t nationals. It’s worlds, where they will likely be the underdog to home favorites Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara, who edged the Americans by 1.3 points in the closest Grand Prix Final pairs’ competition in 12 years.Like Knierim and Frazier, Chock and Bates delivered as overwhelming favorites in Thursday’s rhythm dance.The defending champions tallied 91.90 points, distancing Caroline Green and Michael Parsons, who scored 81.40, going into Saturday’s free dance.“Freedom and joy came through right from the start of the program,” Chock said on USA Network. “There was no holding back.”Last year’s silver and bronze medalists aren’t in the field: Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue retired after winning Olympic bronze, while Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker withdrew last week, citing mental health.So Chock, 30, and Bates, 33, are almost certain to make the podium for an 11th consecutive year, which would be one shy of the record for any discipline, and lead the three couples picked for March’s worlds.“We just want to earn it,” Bates said. “Just because we’ve been around longer than most doesn’t necessarily dictate the results.”Bates, who last year became the oldest U.S. champion in any discipline in decades, has made 12 career senior nationals podiums with Chock and former partner Emily Samuelson. It is believed that a 13th finish in the top three would break the U.S. record for a single discipline he currently shares with Michelle Kwan, Nathaniel Niles and Theresa Weld Blanchard.But Chock and Bates’ sights are set on a place they’ve never been — the top step of a world championships podium. They earned silver or bronze a total of three times, including a bronze last year. The gold and silver medalists aren’t competing this season.However, Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier relegated the Americans to silver at December’s Grand Prix Final.“If we don’t win gold at worlds, we’ll be disappointed,” Bates, whose first senior nationals in 2008 came when this year’s women’s singles favorite, Isabeau Levito, was 10 months old, said earlier this month. “We’ve set the goal for ourselves in the past and haven’t met it yet.”Nationals continue later Thursday with the women’s short.NBC Sports’ Sarah Hughes (not the figure skater) contributed to this report.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

Still Bitcoin's more than 35% rise this year remains a feel-good story, even if analysts remain wary about its short-term prospects, along with those of other cryptos still reeling from the industry misdeeds of 2022.""An uptick in volume in conjunction with higher prices is generally a bullish sign,"" CoinDesk Crypto Markets Analyst Glenn Williams wrote in his weekday column. ""Flat prices however, signal that bullish and bearish investors are both actively expressing their market views.""Ether followed a similar slightly reddish path to trade just below its current $1,600 support.

Since the start of the year, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and more recently IBM have announced job cuts.The 2.5% rise in GDP and an unexpected decline in jobless claims on Thursday had little impact on the current investment environment, which turned cautiously hopeful that inflation will continue waning without the economy falling into deep recession. That combination would likely enable the U.S. central bank to ratchet back the size of its next interest rate hike next week.In an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Jason Pagoulatos, markets associate at research group Delphi Digital, said that he didn't think the latest GDP would have a great affect on crypto markets. Pagoulatos said that instead, investors were eyeing the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, although more for accompanying comments than whether Fed governors raise interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points.""The market knows that the rate hikes are going continue but at a slower pace until they reach whatever their terminal rate is,"" he said. ""The main question is that people are trying to get clarity over is how long and then what that ultimately means for things that are still showing signs of strength like the labor market.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorPolygonMATIC+7.9%Smart Contract PlatformChainlinkLINK+1.0%ComputingBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorDecentralandMANA−5.1%EntertainmentSolanaSOL−4.6%Smart Contract PlatformCosmosATOM−4.0%Smart Contract PlatformInsightsLitecoin Forges OnwardBy Sam ReynoldsForgotten in the carnage of 2022, where new, fancy, layer 1 protocols had their price and total value locked (TVL) decimated, was litecoin. Markets data shows that it outperformed both bitcoin and ether throughout the year.The Litecoin network has been around since 2011, a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, and LTC is the first altcoin. Litecoin has stayed on the sidelines while the market became infatuated with Ethereum and layer 1 blockchains including Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot and whatever else is surging at the moment.Aside from an episode in the fall of 2021 involving a fake press release and Walmart, Litecoin, despite its $6 billion market cap, just doesn’t command the same kind of attention as its decentralized finance-focused contemporaries (there is a small Litecoin DeFi community via the BoringDAO), nor does it have the institutional interest. Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust, for instance, only has assets under management of $136 million, compared to the $14.65 billion in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and trades at a 55% discount compared to GBTC’s 42%.Despite all this, over the last year, LTC is only down around 17% compared to 34% for ether and 37% for bitcoin.Litecoin/U.S dollar daily chart (TradingView)Data shared by CryptoQuant contributing analyst Mohsen Saleh shows that both whales and retail investors are bullish on litecoin.The supply distribution indicates that the assets in wallets holding fewer than 10,000 LTC decreased from August 2020 to May 2022. However, after May this cohort began increasing their holdings, and their collective bag has grown 10% since then.Meanwhile, the cohort of wallets that hold fewer than 100,000 litecoin each now collectively holds more than 39 million LTC, showing that whales are also building up their supply.“We have seen increased trading volume on litecoin pairs over the past year, indicating that traders may be valuing faster [peer-to-peer] transactions in a bear market,” OKX Managing Director of Financial Markets Lennex Lai told CoinDesk.Lai pointed out that shorter transaction and processing times, when compared to bitcoin, made it a diversification play for many traders.There’s also the halving narrative. Like Bitcoin, of which the Litecoin protocol was forked, the rewards delivered to miners are expected to decrease from 12.5 LTC to 6.5 LTC sometime in August. In turn, this reduces the supply of litecoin available as the mining process becomes less efficient. The previous halvings in August 2015 and August 2019 also pushed a bullish trend, as CoinDesk previously reported.“It could be argued that the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory is displaying a stock-to-flow model, similar to previous halvings [where] a price rally takes place in the months leading to the halving event,” Andrey Stoychev, a project manager on Nexo’s Institutional Prime Brokerage team, told CoinDesk.Stoychev adds that litecoin’s decade-plus existence on the market means a lot for traders, who continue to HODL through the good times and bad.In crypto, sometimes it is slow and steady that wins the race. Even though it might not be exciting, the staying power of LTC as a store of value is the narrative that the market seems to respect.Litecoin is trading at about $87.50, down about 3.5% over the past 24 hours.PricesImportant events9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) United States Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index (MoM/Dec)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) United States Personal Income (MoM/Dec)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (Jan)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:HeadlinesCoinbase’s $3.6M Dutch Fine Shows Crypto Will Hit Road Bumps as It Goes Mainstream: As crypto comes within the regulatory fold, there will be disputes over rules, procedures and jurisdiction – and the relatively compliant may end up bearing the brunt of regulators’ wrath.Sam Bankman-Fried’s Mother and Brother Not Cooperating With Financial Probe, FTX Lawyers Say: Seeking to locate allegedly misappropriated funds, the lawyers from the bankrupt crypto exchange have gotten some answers from the founder's father.Moody’s Developing Scoring System for Stablecoins: Bloomberg: The move comes as the quality of stablecoin reserves continues to receive scrutiny.Polygon Q4 Transaction Volatility Fueled by FTX Collapse, ZK Rollup Testing, Nansen Says: A surge in daily addresses was partially due to the launch of Polygon’s zero-knowledge EVM public testnet.

CEO Arnold Donald.""Salesforce is one of the preeminent software companies in the world, and having followed the company for nearly two decades, we have developed a deep respect for Marc Benioff and what he has built,"" Jesse Cohn, Elliott's big-name portfolio manager, said in a statement to Yahoo Finance.

Activist Jeff Ubben at Inclusive Capital is also reportedly in Salesforce shares.A source familiar with Starboard's thinking told Yahoo Finance that Salesforce has significantly more room to improve margins — if it wants to get serious about doing so. One way could be to divest recent acquisitions such as Slack, pros have told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesSalesforce finds itself on defense with investors arguably for the first time as a public company.The cloud-based software company is in the process of laying off some 8,000 people amid a drive to bolster lagging profit margins the activists are up in arms about following high-profile deals for Slack, Tableau, and Mulesoft.

Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra as independent directors, according to the people. It’s also discussing the possibility of giving a board seat to ValueAct Capital Management CEO Mason Morfit, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.Salesforce had been working on refreshing its board for several months, one of the people said. Deliberations are ongoing, and there’s no certainty that Salesforce will reach an agreement on the board appointments.ValueAct, run by Morfit, has won board seats on big companies, including financial technology giant Fiserv Inc. A representative for Salesforce declined to comment, while a spokesperson for ValueAct didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Elliott Investment Management has taken a multibillion-dollar stake in the enterprise software company, which has been rocked by a deep stock swoon and executive turnover. Salesforce earlier this month said it would cut 10% of its workforce, about 8,000 jobs. In October, Starboard Value also took a stake in the San Francisco-based company. Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital also is a shareholder, CNBC reported.Elliott is talking with technology executives and those from other industries as it prepares to nominate a slate of directors, according to a person familiar with the matter. The nomination window opens Feb. 12. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Elliott’s plan to propose board candidates.Story continuesThe shares jumped 5.7% to $165.09 at the close in New York. The stock plunged 48% in 2022 amid a sharp decline in technology shares, but has gained almost 25% this year through the close.Pressure is mounting on Salesforce to boost profits and shareholder returns after a half-decade of fast hiring and large acquisitions, including the purchase of business communications app Slack in 2021 for $27.7 billion. In addition to board changes, activist investors will likely push the company to cut more jobs or spin off big acquisitions in search of greater profit, Wall Street analysts said.In February, Marc Benioff will become sole CEO of the company he co-founded after the departure of co-CEO Bret Taylor, who was appointed to the post in November 2021 and widely seen as a potential successor. Other top executives such as Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and Chief Strategy Officer Gavin Patterson also have departed. Some investors feared an unchecked Benioff would make more large acquisitions.While Paul Singer’s Elliott has pushed for new CEOs at other companies, Jesse Cohn, managing partner, said the firm has developed a “deep respect” for Benioff.(Updates with Elliott’s plans in the sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA $500 Million Bet on Reinvigorating Japan’s Aging Ski IndustrySean Penn’s Disaster-Relief Charity Ended Up a Money MessWall Street: We Want Lower Rates.

A weak report here from the company, missing on both the top and bottom lines, their guidance coming in a bit light. We certainly are seeing that reflected in the after-hours move here.The CFO of Intel saying that they did take steps to rightsize the business in Q4. We know there are cost cutting efforts. They're looking to cut $3 billion in costs this year, up to $10 billion in 2025. Over the last three months, the stock has gotten a bit of a boost here, up just about 10 and 1/2%, nearly giving all of that back, though, in extended trading.Taking a look at KLA, that stock also under a bit of pressure, off just about 5% right now. The company's sinking as the outlook disappointed. This, of course, follows that drop in the chip demand. So Intel, KLA, those reports disappointing. We're seeing that also reflected in some of those competitors out there. Nvidia stock under pressure, Qualcomm stock under pressure here after-hours. So a couple of names to keep in mind ahead of tomorrow's opening bell.Taking a look at Hasbro, that stock off just about 9% of huge headlines here. They announced their preliminary results, cutting 1,000 jobs, 15% of their workforce. President and COO here, Eric Neiman, will also be leaving the company. The prelim Q4 revenue number missed, EPS coming in a bit light. Holiday sales, quote, ""underperformed.""

Visa also saying that effective February 1st, Ryan McInerney will be taking over as CEO. Again, we're looking at gains here after-hours.Rounding it out with Salesforce, that stock under a bit of pressure after popping here in intraday trading, but off just about a half of a percent. A Wall Street Journal report now out saying that Elliott is preparing to nominate directors at Salesforce. It didn't name any specific names, but clearly a battle is heating up for some of those board seats.Now the Journal reports followed the Bloomberg report that we got out earlier this afternoon, saying that Salesforce is discussing appointing a new board member. Some of those names that were being discussed, former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra. Now this is for Salesforce.

The names being discussed include former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, also Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra. Now the report also states that there are discussions about adding ValueAct Capital Management CEO Mason Morfitt to the board as well.Salesforce has become a target for activist investors, most recently this week, Elliott Management, which took a multi-billion dollar stake in the company. And Dave, like you and I have been talking about this week, when Elliott Management enters the picture, people listen.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, Patrick Gadson, who's an activist investor attorney joined us just a couple of days ago, said they are basically the Godzilla of the space. They get what they want. They take as much time as they want. And they spend as much money as they want to get their results, but he also said that news that Elliott Management was involved here probably was because either talks had broken down, or there was some sort of agreement to satisfy Paul Singer/Elliott Management.And it looks like, Seana, that he was probably fortuitous in that that they had some sort of board agreement in place, and Elliott wanted to get credit for that. That's just me reading into that. They wanted credit for that, therefore leaking the story.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. We will wait to see if we hear anything from Salesforce, either confirming or denying those reports.]"
89,9ef8736d-b098-3502-96ff-7df31c5b55bc,RL,2023-01-27,Analysts Estimate Ralph Lauren (RL) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-ralph-lauren-rl-150103819.html,1674745263,STORY,['RL'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Ralph Lauren (RL) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis upscale clothing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.64% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ralph Lauren?For Ralph Lauren, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ralph Lauren will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ralph Lauren would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.23, delivering a surprise of +6.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ralph Lauren doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The acquisition also includes 35 miles of in-field gas and water-gathering pipelines. The company is acquiring an active Devonian Salt Water Disposal well with a strong proven injection capacity.The acquisition will add 18,500 net acres (99% held by production) in the center of the northern Delaware Basin in Matador’s Ranger asset area in Lea County. In first-quarter 2023, estimated production from the assets totaled 24,500-25,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The acquisition will significantly increase Matador’s inventory by 406 gross drillable horizontal locations, with potential targets across the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Avalon formations. The company expects the acquired assets to generate forward one-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $475-$525 million.The acquisition offers Matador additional operational scale in the Delaware Basin, which is expected to improve the company’s overall rates of return and unit-of-production cost. The transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2023.Mergers and acquisitions are becoming increasingly common as companies intend to achieve their growth objectives.

These include roughly 80 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, along with 36 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage, in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.

Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Let's take a closer look at how each one stacks up.ChevronChevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program.The recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase.In addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings.Most importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings.And our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter.Kinder MorganKinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion.Story continuesAn increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually.Impressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts.Agilent TechnologiesAgilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).On January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program.Agilent has reported strong results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases. Just in its latest print, the company posted a 10% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 5% above expectations.The company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.6%. Still, while the yield may be on the lower end of the spectrum, Agilent's 8.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.Bottom LineBuybacks have been common in recent years, with titans such as Apple and Microsoft also regularly joining in on the fun.Buybacks send a positive message to investors, indicating that the company is confident in its future prospects.All three companies above – Chevron, Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies – have recently announced repurchase programs, with investors cheering on the news.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Gross margin fell a whopping 12 percentage points to 43.8%.The figures corroborated what had already been hinted at in a sharp drop in revenue for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) flagship Windows business earlier in the week.After stripping out one-off items, Intel reported earnings per share of 10 cents on revenue of $14B. Both fell short of expectations, which were for EPS of 21 cents on revenue of $14.5B.For the market, however, the fourth quarter numbers weren't the worst of it. Intel said it expects to lose as much as 15c a share in the first quarter, on revenue in a range of around $11B. Wall Street analysts had expected $13.9B of revenue and 24c in underlying earnings.That's due largely to a global backdrop of weakening global demand for PCs: Intel says in its presentation it expects total shipments to be at the lower end of its forecast range of 270-295M this year.Analysts at Barclays noted that the guidance was below even the weakest forecasts on the Street.""We readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expect of ourselves,"" CEO Pat Gelsinger told an analysts' call.Intel continued to be coy about how many jobs it expects to cut this year but repeated its target of cutting $3B in costs this year, rising to between $8-10B by the end of 2025.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the expected drop in sales put in doubt the company's ability to maintain its dividend, which is currently running at $1.5B a quarter or 36.5c a share.Story continues""We believe will need a V-shaped recovery in 2H to avoid continued cash burn.

ETD, Paychex Inc. PAYX and Arista Networks ANET.3 Companies Boasting Strong Balance SheetsThe extensive list of stocks investors can choose from can undoubtedly become overwhelming, leaving them unsure where to park their hard-earned cash.However, targeting companies with favorable balance sheet characteristics, such as a low debt load, can help filter out bad apples.Debt can limit a company's flexibility and ability to invest in growth opportunities, including R&amp;D, tapping into new markets, or even hiring more talent.And, of course, when a company's debt load is heavy, it becomes more vulnerable to economic downturns or other forces that could negatively impact business.Three companies with a light debt load –Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., Paychex Inc. and Arista Networks – could all be considered.Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. Ethan Allen Interiors is a leader in interior design, selling a full range of home furnishings through a retail network of design centers and its online website. The company has a clean balance sheet with zero total debt and cash and equivalents of $142 million as of its latest quarter.ETD's 27.5% TTM return on equity (ROE) is impressive, well above the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average of 16.3%.ETD's high ROE shows that the company has successfully generated profits from existing assets, undoubtedly a positive signal.Paychex Inc. Paychex is a recognized leader in the payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing industry. PAYX's earnings outlook has drifted higher over the last several months, pushing it into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company exited its latest quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $875 million in total debt, indicating an advantageous ability to wipe out obligations easily.In addition, PAYX's 45.5% TTM ROE is well above its Zacks Business Services sector average of 18.5%.Story continuesArista NetworksArista Networks provides cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments. The company exited its latest quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents and total debt of a mere $57 million.Further, the company has had little issue exceeding quarterly estimates, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back quarters.In its latest release, ANET beat the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 20% and reported revenue 11% above expectations.Bottom LineCompanies reflecting favorable balance sheet characteristics are attractive investments, as these companies are better equipped to weather negative business or economic developments.All three companies above – Ethan Allen, Paychex and Arista Networks – carry a very manageable debt load paired with a solid cash pile.For those that like to target companies less vulnerable to downturns, all three deserve a watchlist spot.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This is expected to be February 2, 2023. On that day, Starbucks is projected to report earnings of $0.77 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6.94%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.8 billion, up 9.31% from the year-ago period.SBUX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.42 per share and revenue of $36.03 billion.

Price and EPS Surprise Brinker International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBrinker International, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Brinker International, Inc. Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors at PlayBrinker International's second-quarter fiscal 2023 top line is likely to reflect benefits from solid Chili's performance, sales-building initiatives and expansion efforts. During the previous quarter, the company emphasized on streamlining operations to reduce the complexity in Chili's business. It also implemented a new pricing strategy to help expand restaurant margins and grow profits. During the fiscal first quarter, domestic comps at Chilli’s (including company-owned and franchised restaurants) rose 3.4% year over year. With an increased focus on sports-driven group viewing occasions and new menu offerings, the momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for company sales Chili's is pegged at $842 million, indicating a rise of 6.3% year over year.Although the company is witnessing a gradual improvement in dining occupancy, it is still lower than in the pre-pandemic era. This and costs related to various sales-boosting initiatives, advertising expenses along with commodity inflation are expected to have affected margins in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Brinker this time around.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.9%.Revenues are expected to be $8.8 billion, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.58% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate.

However, high costs and dismal China performance continues to affect the company.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversStarbucks’ North America comps have impressed investors for the seventh straight quarter rising 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter, owing to an improvement of 10% in average ticket. Global comparable store sales increased 7% year over year, primarily driven by an 8% rise in average tickets. For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of 7-9% target range.The management focuses on increasing global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, aggressive product innovation and brand building. In the second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Starbucks opened 313, 318 and 763 net new stores worldwide, respectively, taking the total store count to 35,711.In fiscal 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion. Consolidated revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 10-12% on a year-over-year basis.For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth to be at the low end of 15-20% range.Starbucks, which share space with McDonald's Corporation MCD, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM, Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC, is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings.Apart from the numerous beverage innovations, Starbucks has also been making an effort to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers. Meanwhile, the company’s Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room elevates the coffee experience to the next level, with small-batch super-premium coffee produced using innovative coffee-brewing techniques.Story continuesConcernsThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. During the fiscal fourth quarter, comps in China declined 16% year over year. The downtick was caused by a 17% decline in transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average tickets.China continues to battle COVID-19 resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. During first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s performance in China is expected to be affected by COVID-19.Moreover, high costs continue to affect the company’s performance. SBUX’s margin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by inflationary pressures along with increased investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training). Reduced traffic in China (due to COVID-19-related restrictions) also added to the woes.A Brief Review of Other StocksMcDonald's: The company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In third-quarter 2022, global comps advanced 9.5%.MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. The company is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help the company to drive long-term growth and capture market share.Yum! Brands: The company has been benefitting from continued focus on off-premise channels, strategic investments in digital technology and refranchising efforts. Moreover, it has implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance the guest experience. The company has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive so far. Also, emphasis on unit expansion efforts bode well.Yum China: The company has been benefitting from menu innovation, unit expansion and digitalization efforts.YUMC is gradually shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand customer base. Also, focus on logistics center openings and supply-chain security bode well. With a focus on improving customer experience and operating efficiency, the company stated continued investments in this direction.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Xcel shares have lost about 2.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Xcel?While Xcel has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xcel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The top and bottom lines advanced year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results have been bolstered by robust global demand, continued strength in the Nutrition unit and a solid product portfolio.Shares of ADM have lost 8.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 9.4% decline.Q4 HighlightsArcher Daniels’ adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share in the fourth quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64. The figure also jumped 28.7% from $1.50 in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were $1.84 per share, up 33.3% from the prior-year quarter’s $1.26. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Revenues advanced 13.6% year over year to $26,231 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,224 million. Solid sales across all segments contributed to the top line.Segment-wise, revenues for Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds grew 16.3% year over year, whereas Carbohydrate Solutions’ revenues rose 1.9% year over year. Nutrition witnessed year-over-year revenue growth of 7.3%.The gross profit increased 6.8% year over year to $1,762 million, while the gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 6.7% in the quarter under review. SG&amp;A expenses rose 14.1% to $897 million.Archer Daniels has reported an adjusted segmental operating profit of $1,665 million in fourth-quarter 2022, up 17.8% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, ADM’s segmental operating profits grew 16.1% year over year to $1,611 million.Segmental Operating ProfitAdjusted operating profit for Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds rose 46.2% year over year to $1,184 million. This can be attributable to strength across the South American region, driven by higher margins and volumes, while low water conditions reduced North America export volumes. The Global Trade performance was drab due to lower ocean freight, partly offset by robust results in EMEA origination and destination marketing.Crushing results have been sharply higher year over year. Strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins in North America. Solid oil demand in EMEA led to strong rapeseed margins, which more than offset higher energy costs.Refined Products and Other results have been strong year over year, benefiting from healthy demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the United States and biodiesel globally. Also, equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher than that in the year-earlier quarter.The Carbohydrate Solutions segment’s adjusted operating profit declined 39% to $261 million. The Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, has recorded improved year-over-year results. This was mainly owing to solid volumes and strong margins in the North America region, which partly offset lower ethanol margins. Meanwhile, robust margins aided the EMEA region. The global wheat milling business witnessed higher margins, driven by solid demand.Vantage Corn Processors’ results have been soft due to higher ethanol inventory levels, which, in turn, dented the margins.In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $131 million fell 18.1% from $160 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit remained dismal year over year. The Flavors unit remained flat, while the continued momentum aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health &amp; Wellness business witnessed year-over-year growth, driven by the bioactives portfolio, including the results of the Deerland acquisition.The Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids due to a recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results have acted as an upside, driven by APAC and Latin America, partly offset by the impacts of sluggish demand in EMEA.Story continuesArcher Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseArcher Daniels Midland Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteOther FinancialsThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,037 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,677 million; and shareholders’ equity of $24,317 million.

Airline experts expect such travel disruptions to become more common. (Jim Cooke / Los Angeles Times; photos by Howard Lipin and K.C. Alfred / San Diego Union-Tribune )Thousands of canceled flights. Countless separated bags. Millions of angry passengers.Southwest Airlines' costly holiday meltdown highlighted how quickly airline operations can go off the rails, particularly when you add bad weather to the complex calculation of how to get crews on the right planes at the right time.The Dallas-based airline has pledged to do better. Southwest's chief executive said the company would invest more than $1 billion to upgrade its IT system, and on Thursday during the first quarterly investor call since the fiasco, company executives spent significant time pledging that the year-end failures would not be repeated. In all, the company canceled more than 16,700 flights, sharply more than other airlines, which recovered faster from the multi-state storms than Southwest did.“We disrupted thousands and thousands of customers at a critical point in time,"" Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan said during the call. ""I can’t apologize enough for that. I own that, and we will do everything it takes to make sure we don't have an event like that again.”But as climate change continues to make once-extreme weather events more routine, and airlines pack more passengers onto planes to increase efficiency and lower prices, a single disruption can throw the whole air travel system into chaos.""It's a commodity where everyone can fly and most people do,"" said Ernest Arvai, president and co-founder of AirInsight, an aviation news and consulting site. ""But if something goes wrong, there's not enough slack left in the system to accommodate everyone quickly.""Southwest is paying dearly for the December disaster.The company said Thursday that an $800-million financial hit from the episode caused a net loss of $220 million for the last three months of 2022. Some travelers have since been avoiding the airline, decisions that will cause another loss in the first quarter of this year, Jordan said. The company expects that things will turn around by March.Story continues""There are things we need to work on as we continue to grow this operation,"" Jordan said during the call.Though much maligned as a major factor in the carrier's slow recovery from weather-related flight cancellations, Southwest's unique point-to-point system is a way for the airline to set itself apart in a competitive marketplace.Flying from one destination to another, rather than through the traditional hub-and-spoke network used by many large airlines, allows Southwest to offer nonstop flights to many locations throughout the United States that aren't being served with direct flights by other major airlines, said Laurie Garrow, professor and aviation expert at Georgia Tech.The lack of hubs also means Southwest can spread out its labor costs instead of needing large numbers of employees during peak times at locations where many planes arrive at the same time. If a location has less demand than expected, it's easier to move planes than relocate an entire hub.However, the hub-and-spoke network is more resilient because there are more pilots and crew members in a single location. If something happens with one flight, there are crew members and planes nearby to help with a faster recovery.In Southwest's case, the complexity of its point-to-point system crashed into the antiquity of its crew scheduling system, leaving the carrier struggling longer than other airlines to return to normal operations, Southwest's pilots union and aviation experts said.The Southwest Airlines Pilots Assn. said the processes used by the airline to connect crews with planes have eroded over the years, leaving pilots stranded in hotel rooms or being shuttled via other passenger flights to their destination even in the best of times.""We are a very complex network,"" said Capt. Casey Murray, president of the Southwest pilots union. ""It's much more difficult not only to manage but recover.""While the airline's point-to-point network is the ""magic that has allowed Southwest to succeed"" and grow, Murray said the company hasn't invested in the infrastructure or processes to make it more resilient to major disruptions.Southwest officials said Thursday that a fix to the crew scheduling software is being tested now and that better communication with crew is being discussed in ongoing union negotiations.A Times analysis of the late-December performance of Southwest and American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, showed that before the storms on Dec. 18, Southwest had a lower cancellation rate (0.05%) than American (1.18%).By Dec. 23, as ferocious and deadly winter storms hit a large part of the nation, Southwest's cancellation rate hit 34.63% while American was at 30.91%. That was the highest cancellation rate for American — after that, the airline largely recovered.But Southwest's cancellations kept climbing to a high of 76.22% on Dec. 26, long after the major inclement weather had passed. Southwest continued to cancel over 50% of its flights until the rate suddenly dropped to 1% on Dec. 30.During the meltdown, Southwest also was forced to fly more than 700 nonpassenger flights to reposition crew and planes, adding to the episode's financial hit.“We can’t continue to be unreliable and not provide our customers with a sense of that reliability,"" Murray said. ""The future of Southwest Airlines is at stake.”And that future may not be up to just Southwest.Shortly after the December debacle, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced it was looking into the incident. In a statement to The Times on Wednesday, a department spokesperson said the agency is in the ""initial phase of a rigorous and comprehensive investigation,"" and that the department has made clear to the airline it will face consequences if it doesn't make timely refunds and reimbursements to customers.The Transportation Department is also looking into whether Southwest executives ""engaged in unrealistic scheduling of flights"" — meaning the carrier had scheduled more flights than it could possibly have handled under the circumstances — which is considered an unfair and deceptive practice under federal law, the spokesperson said.On Thursday, Southwest officials said they will cooperate fully with the investigation and that the airline's recent on-time performance and reliability show that the airline's schedule is viable.Southwest's stated effort to fix its problems with new software and systems is a good step, but it can't happen instantaneously, said Arvai of AirInsight.""All we need is one giant storm, and will we have a repeat of what happened a few weeks ago?” he said.In the future, Southwest may want to cancel more flights ahead of poor weather to prevent the domino effect that happened this time, said Garrow of Georgia Tech.""There's a big incentive for Southwest to get this right,"" she said. ""Making some of the long-term infrastructure investments will help, but I think the real test is if you’re able to get your operational performance back up to the level of your competitors.""But the narrow margin for error across the airline industry means that Southwest will not be the last airline in the future to face extreme disruption. Fuller planes mean there are fewer open seats to accommodate those passengers.""The problem is, when disruption happens, how big is the disruption and how quickly can the airline come back with minimal cancellations, minimal delays and get back to normal operations?” said Ahmed Abdelghany, associate dean for research and professor of operations management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""At this level, we don’t have a way to completely eliminate this problem from the system.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Tesla closing up just about 11%, the leader in the NASDAQ 100 today, closing at its highest level that we've seen in the last six months after fourth quarter results came in better than feared. Now, Wall Street reacting positively to the numbers and the comments about strong demand from CEO Elon Musk. We have Citigroup, Bank of America, Wolfe Research, Wells Fargo, Cowen, Wedbush among the names they're raising their price targets today.And, Dave, taking a look at the momentum that we're clearly seeing in Tesla stock, we talked to Gary Black earlier in the show. He's a future fund managing partner there. Clearly, a Tesla bull. He was saying that the Cybertruck is going to be one of the huge catalysts, get people back on the hype train when it comes to Tesla, and really take it back to those higher levels that we had seen. When you check out some of the losses that we've seen over the last 12 months, I'm not sold yet. But, clearly, the Street very encouraged by what we did get from Tesla and by the commentary that we heard from Musk.- Are you on team Briggs with the Cybertruck because, look, I just don't see it.- And you love pickup trucks. You love trucks.- I love trucks. And I love Teslas. But that car will not be driven by most Americans. It, frankly, will not. And people always use the preorders as the real catalyst. Those preorders are fully refundable. $100 fully refundable deposit. I'm not buying it. But he also pointed out they're not just a car company, Gary Black, pointing out that megapacks, for example, could be a real catalyst for tremendous earnings down the road.But he said something really interesting as well about Elon Musk's macro talk about the economy. He said investors really don't pay attention to it. But the problem is Elon Musk on that call really undermined his own argument on that call by saying we're going to go through a pretty difficult recession and then saying he sees skyrocketing demand for very expensive EV that is the Tesla, and the potential for 2 million. So how do you-- even if he's wrong, how does he justify in that brilliant mind that there's going to be a recession while there's going to be tremendous demand for Teslas? I don't see it.Story continues- Yeah. Something's not adding up there. But I think maybe the positive spin on this, at least from the Street's perspective-- Deutsche Bank did weigh in on this. If, in fact, we do see a slowdown, they were saying, obviously, not great for Tesla. But the company is better positioned given its cash position, given the levers that it does have at its disposal than some of the competitors out there. But you got a question if we do head for a recession, maybe a larger downturn than what we are anticipating at this point, it's not going to be good for Tesla. It's not to be good for many consumer-facing companies.- Yeah. I would have just liked to hear his justification for why he sees that coming. Just one other note. His CFO I thought was interesting in saying we're going to, quote, ""attack every area of cost."" That does play into the potential for recession. And maybe that's helpful in cutting the cost of the supply chain. So that was interesting. All right. More earnings news. Reaction in the market today with several airlines moving following quarterly reports. American, JetBlue, and of course the one we've all been waiting for, Southwest reporting today.But you can see Southwest the loser of the bunch today. The company revealing an $800 million loss due to that holiday travel meltdown in December. Their CEO Bob Jordan telling Bloomberg, quote, ""we know for a fact we were absolutely staffed to operate our schedules. I do not believe the issue is staffing."" Now, these comments coming on the same day Southwest says it plans to hire 7,000 workers in 2023. So still a bit of a mixed picture from the airline after it canceled 16,000-plus flights in late December.And that isn't just a drag on this quarter, but probably Q1 2023 and, Seana, quite frankly, maybe well after. Remember, their pilot captain of the union Casey Murray told us-- I asked him, if you were a customer right now, would you fly Southwest? And he said point blank no, no way, and laid out the reasons for it.- Yeah. I think we're certainly are seeing some of that overhang from all the flights. Over 16,000 flights canceled. Clearly, they are seeing cancellations, something that CEO Bob Jordan talked about on the earnings call. What surprised me was the fact that he only sees this as being Q1 issue. I do tend to agree with you, Dave, that I have a hard time buying that maybe some people are going to be a little hesitant when booking with Southwest into Q2, maybe even Q3.But when you take a look at these numbers, clearly, it's going to be a challenging several months here for the airline. The company did say that they do expect a negative revenue impact of $350 million to $350 million in the current quarter. Whether or not that of course drags on to the second quarter only time will tell. CEO Bob Jordan also going on to say that they are working with a consulting firm to try to determine some of those issues. To address those issues, it's going to take a huge investment. And like we've talked about time and time again, it's a fix that's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time. So Southwest currently has their work cut out for them.- I was just curious why you thought JetBlue was down slightly on a really good report. Is that because the good news is already baked in? They've already have had a pretty solid month?- Yeah. They've had a pretty solid month. And when you take a look at some of those larger charts, you have seen-- longer term charts, I should say. You have seen a bit of a rebound more recently, the stock barely closing negative there. But like you were saying, it was a very different quarter than what we just heard from Southwest. They said that they were on track to deliver those cost reductions that they had been targeting of $250 million through 2024. The CEO saying that the demand environment remains solid this year. So, clearly, totally different picture over at JetBlue.Let's take a look at Mastercard because shares at the credit card company closing lower here. You can see it off just over 1% after the company warned that revenue growth could slow faster than expected in the current quarter. Still, though, Mastercard's CEO saying in a statement that, quote, ""while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient."" He then went on to say, ""we are well prepared to adjust our investment profile quickly if needed.""So it's interesting just to weigh that against the reaction that we're seeing in the stock price today. And taking a look at the analyst reaction here, they actually said that trends in January look, quote, unquote, ""healthy"" so far. So a drop of 1%, not too much to be worried about.- No. And it's so interesting. Again and again and again we hear these predictions of recession. And more from the earnings call from their CEO, pointed out strong labor market, low unemployment, rising wages, elevated consumer savings levels. And it's a lot like we heard from Paul Riley, Raymond James CEO, early in the show saying, I just don't see it. We don't see it in our clients. We don't see it in our customers. But we're going to prepare for it. So it's a strange dichotomy going on with this economy where everyone's coming out and saying we don't see a recession in our customers and our clients, but we're going to potentially prepare.- Hopefully, we don't see it.- Yeah. Hopefully, we do not.]"

SkiftTwo months. That’s how long Southwest Airlines expects there to be an impact on bookings from its massive holiday meltdown that disrupted millions of travelers over Christmas and New Years.The Dallas-based carrier forecasts a $300-350 million hit to revenues as a result of the meltdown in January and February, it disclosed in its fourth-quarter results Thursday. That is on top of the roughly $800 million hit it took in December. But, by March, executives are confident that the fallout — at least on its earnings statement — will be fully behind it.“I think we’re going to be very pleased with the [financial performance in the month of March,” Southwest Chief Commercial Officer said during the airline’s earnings call Thursday. “It feels like we’re, kind of, back on plan.”That’s pretty remarkable considering the magnitude of the disruption that began on December 21 and continued through New Years Eve. Southwest canceled more than 16,700 flights or, put another way, nearly 40 percent of its schedule over that 11 day period. That, based on back of the notebook calculations using its average of 83 percent of seats filled during the fourth quarter, equals as many as 2.2 million affected travelers (the actual number may be lower because some travelers are connecting on two or more flights).Put another way, the number of travelers impacted by Southwest’s meltdown was equal to the population of the Kansas City metro area.“I’m not proud of what happened,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told investors on the call. He apologized again for the meltdown and then, along with Chief Operations Officer Andrew Watterson, detailed all the steps the carrier has and is taking to ensure a comparable meltdown does not happen again at Southwest.While severe winter storms were the initial catalyst for Southwest’s meltdown, it was its crew scheduling software — SkySolver provided by supplier GE Digital — that was unable to keep up with the situation and prompted the multi-day reset of the airline. Watterson said upgrades to allow the system to keep up with a dramatic spike in crew rescheduling events have already been made by GE, and are currently being tested.Story continuesIn addition, Southwest has taken a number of other steps to ensure a similar meltdown will not happen again. These include a new early warning system of any potential spike in the number of crew and aircraft that need to be rescheduled; new crew communications tools; more crew scheduling staff; and a full review of the airline’s cold-weather operational preparedness. In addition, Southwest has engaged advisors Oliver Wyman to do a full review of the meltdown and its causes; Watterson said they expect the report “soon.”One area where Jordan and his team were on the defensive was on technology investment. In response to analysts’ questions over potential underinvestment, he said: “We invest a lot in technology … There’s been no lack of investment.” Jordan went on to describe the investments as a “journey,” where there is a constant need to make upgrades as the airline grows increasingly complex. Southwest will invest roughly $1.3 billion in technology this year, up from about $1 billion in 2022.“At the end of the day, that kind of disruption cannot happen again,” Jordan said.Expansion Plan ContinuesSouthwest’s schedule recovery and growth — it will surpass 2019 flying levels this year — continues unabated in 2023. System capacity will increase roughly 10 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, and 16-17 percent for the full year. The full-year number is at least one point higher than the airline’s previous guidance owing to year-over-year comparisons to the holiday meltdown.Jordan and other executives emphasized that the operational chaos in December was no reason to put Southwest’s growth plan on hold. Travel demand is robust with the exception of January and February. And managed corporate travel, a key indicator of the economic recovery, is expected to hit 2019 levels by March; it was at 80 percent of three years ago in the fourth quarter.And Southwest is ahead on its hiring plan. The airline saw a net headcount increase of 11,000 staff in 2022, which Jordan said was more than its target. It plans to add another net 7,000 staff this year. Pilot hiring, however, will step up with the airline seeking roughly 1,700 new cockpit crew members compared to 1,000 last year.Jordan and other executives did not comment on Southwest’s use of temporary staff, including for ramp positions. This was reported to be among the initial causes of its weather-related cancellations during the holidays that cascaded into its full meltdown.Almost all of the carrier’s growth this year will go into restoring the depth of its network. When the pandemic hit, the first thing to go were the multiple daily flights Southwest offered on key routes — for example, the Los Angeles-Phoenix route had eight daily flights where today it has five — those lost frequencies will come back this year. In addition, it plans significant growth in several key cities, including boosting Baltimore-Washington to more than 220 daily departures and Denver to more than 300 departures by July.The growth in Denver comes after the airport opened a 16-gate extension of Southwest’s concourse for the airline last year. The Baltimore-Washington airport is also investing in new terminal facilities for Southwest.Investigations HeadacheSouthwest’s capacity growth forecast “could be a cause for future concern given the severe operational issues previously experienced in their network over the holiday season and in the months prior,” Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Helane Becker wrote on the carrier’s outlook Thursday.While her comments came before Jordan and other executives commented on their plans, Becker raised a key concern among both investors and travelers about Southwest’s outlook. Namely, whether the airline is actually able to fly the full schedule it sells. This was something United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby highlighted in his takedown of the airline industry’s capacity forecasts earlier in January.Jordan and his team were clear in their remarks: Southwest was staffed and ready to operate its full schedule over the holidays. It was only the weather, and the inability of its scheduling system to keep up with the amount of changes, that led to the meltdown.Ultimately, though, that is not for Southwest to decide. The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched an inquiry into the carrier’s scheduling practices, and whether it was selling more than it could reasonably operate over the holidays — meltdown aside.“DOT is in the initial phase of a rigorous and comprehensive investigation into Southwest Airlines’ holiday debacle that stranded millions,” an agency spokesperson said. The “DOT is also probing whether Southwest executives engaged in unrealistic scheduling of flights which under federal law is considered an unfair and deceptive practice.”Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been critical of Southwest’s handling of the meltdown, describing it as “unacceptable” in December. He has promised to use the full weight of the DOT to ensure the carrier refunds tickets and reimburses travelers for all eligible expenses. Legislators in both the House and Senate have also called for answers, and said they plan to hold hearings on the situation.Any potential action or penalties against Southwest could extend the period where the airline feels the financial burden of its meltdown well beyond February.And the NumbersSouthwest lost $220 million in the fourth quarter after the roughly $800 million meltdown hit. Revenues increased 7.7 percent compared to 2019 to $6.2 billion but expenses ballooned nearly 30 percent to $6.6 billion. Revenue per available seat mile, a measure of how much the airline makes per mile it flies, increased 14.9 percent from three years earlier, while costs per available seat mile excluding fuel and special items jumped nearly 45 percent. Southwest flew 6 percent less capacity in the fourth quarter than it did in 2019.And for the full year, Southwest posted a $539 million net profit. Revenues increased 6 percent compared to 2019 to $23.8 billion. Revenue per available seat mile was up 12.5 percent, and costs per available seat mile excluding fuel and special items by more than 22 percent.Looking ahead, Southwest anticipates a 20-24 percent increase in revenues in the first quarter compared to last year. Unit costs excluding fuel and special items are forecast to increase 2-4 percent; the metric is forecast to drop 6-8 percent for all of 2023.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

California has already banned menthols.The U.S. proceeded to eliminate nearly all nicotine from cigarettes.As federal regulators revamped the industry, big tobacco companies competed to grab pieces of the U.S. e-cigarette market.The FDA in June ordered Juul to halt its U.S. sales which neared the settlement of lawsuits accusing it of marketing its products to children and teens.Juul reached talks with Altria last fall on a potential deal to sell Juul’s international business or license its U.S. intellectual property. Still, those talks fell apart in September as Juul prepared for a possible bankruptcy.Last September, Altria shared plans to end the agreement with Juul, which helped the latter prepare for its sale.In January, Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite and other executives traveled to Switzerland, where Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris are based, to discuss Juul’s newly expanded option.Juul has also resumed discussions with Altria. Altria cannot buy Juul outright over antitrust concerns.If the FDA ultimately halts Juul’s sales, Juul could seek U.S. authorization for a newer version of its vaporizer released in Canada and the U.K.Price Action: MO shares traded higher by 0.11% at $44.98 in the premarket on the last check Thursday.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

HCA Healthcare (HCA), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this hospital operator has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.87%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, HCA came out with earnings of $3.93 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 per share, representing a surprise of 1.03%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.67 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.21 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.71%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for HCA lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.HCA currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.91%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 27, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And by the way, when you do, you're not going to always get it right,"" Solomon said at the World Economic Forum's annual gathering last week.He then reeled off Goldman's growth numbers: average revenues up 44% over a three-year period, a 39% jump in book value per share since 2019 that outpaced peers and a bigger dividend than rivals.The company is being ""prudent"" on expenses by laying off thousands, Solomon said. It will also shed some of the $59 billion of alternative investments that weighed on earnings.But shareholders want to know more about the Wall Street giant's plans after results fell short of expectations and one unit lost $3 billion over three years.Solomon offered few specifics on future strategy, but those details may come at the company's investor meeting on Feb. 28 in New York.""Investors remain skeptical,"" said Joe Rava, an equity analyst at abrdn, which owns shares in the bank.David Konrad of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods was one of several analysts who recently cut Goldman's share price target, noting that it suffered from ""a perfect storm of declining revenues in a challenging market.""And for UBS analyst Brennan Hawken, who rates Goldman at neutral, the idea of buying the stock on expectations of a higher price-to-earnings ratio ""is really, really hard right now.""Still, Goldman shares are up 3.6% over the past year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 banking index and peers.Story continuesSince taking the helm in 2018, Solomon has tried to diversify Goldman beyond its traditional powerhouses of trading -- which languished after the 2008 financial crisis -- and investment banking. But those divisions have become even more dominant, comprising 69% of the firm's revenue at the end of last year, versus 58% the year Solomon took over.The CEO also championed Marcus, a retail banking business that faltered even as it attracted more than $100 billion in deposits.The company slashed Solomon's pay by 29% to $25 million for 2022. It cited a ""challenging operating environment,"" but also noted his ""effective leadership,"" according to a filing.Goldman's moves into consumer lending and transaction banking were ""head scratchers,"" said Kush Goel, senior research analyst at asset manager Neuberger Berman, which owns the bank's stock. Instead, it should have followed rival Morgan Stanley, which earns a steady stream of income from wealth-management fees, he said.Goldman's asset and wealth management unit generated 34% of its revenue in the fourth quarter, while Morgan Stanley derived 63% of its revenue from comparable divisions.""Goldman Sachs has set a very clear strategic direction,"" said Tony Fratto, a company spokesman. The bank ""is making strong progress on that vision"" by bringing in greater fees from asset and wealth management, maximizing its position in banking and markets, and seeking pretax profits for platform solutions, he said.Goldman's strengths in dealmaking and trading also make it more vulnerable to economic and market volatility than competitors, said Hawken at UBS.Solomon, who rose to the top job from investment banking, said that division is ""doing great,"" despite fees falling 48% last year as deals dried up. ""There's no capital markets opportunity -- that's not permanent,"" Solomon said.In October, Goldman scaled back ambitions for Marcus by placing it under the newly-merged asset and wealth division. It also swept parts of the business into a new unit called platform solutions, which houses transaction banking, credit cards and financial technology.While platform solutions made up only 3% of Goldman's revenue, it accounted for about 64% of the $2.72 billion the bank set aside last year for potential credit losses. The company said it was required to boost provisions to meet accounting standards.David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said ""investors will probably need some hand holding"" to see the path to greater profits.Jim Lebenthal, a partner at Cerity Partners who manages client portfolios including shares of the Wall Street behemoth, said it should play to its strengths.""Going back to what has made Goldman great for decades will allow the firm to reset and recover,"" he said.(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen and Saeed Azhar; Additional reporting by Niket Nishant and Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Anna Driver)]"

The bottom line decreased 15% year over year. However, it came above the company’s guidance of $2.22 per share.The decline was driven by lower volumes in the Packaging and Paper segments, higher operating costs, rising freight and logistic expenses, and raised depreciation expenses. Higher converting costs and scheduled maintenance outage expenses affected the results. These headwinds were somewhat offset by rising prices and mix in thePackaging segment, declining freight and logistics expenses, a reduced share count resulting from share repurchases, and a lower tax rate.Including special items (primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, AL mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion-related activities), earnings in the reported quarter were $2.31 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s $2.28 per share.Operational UpdateSales in the fourth quarter declined 3.2% year over year to $1,978 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,055 million.The cost of products sold was down 0.3% year over year to $1,528 million in the fourth quarter. The gross profit declined 11.7% year over year to $450 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $146 million, up from the prior year’s $141 million.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +114.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.38 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.81% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aptiv PLC?For Aptiv PLC, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Aptiv PLC will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aptiv PLC would post earnings of $1.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.28, delivering a surprise of +23.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aptiv PLC appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerConfluent (CFLT), another stock in the Zacks Technology Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.15 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +21.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $162.39 million, up 35.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Confluent has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.17%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Confluent will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The median Canadian Pension Plan returned 2.8 percent for the quarter and -12.8 percent year to date.The fourth quarter of 2022 witnessed a welcomed rally across global financial markets. As major central banks marched forward with consecutive interest rate hikes throughout the year, data emerged signaling their perseverance to combat inflation was starting to gain traction. Despite only modest signs of slowing price growth, equities responded favorably with a positive tone and showed a healthy rebound from the previous quarter. Canadian bonds continued to be impacted by the steady rise in interest rates, thus generating muted results for the period.In contrast to the quarterly results, both equity and bond markets concluded 2022 with annual returns in negative territory as a result of lingering challenges faced throughout the year including supply chain concerns, geopolitical uncertainty, monetary tightening and soaring inflation. The S&amp;P TSX index declined less than its global counterparts for the year, as the Canadian dollar lost over 6% relative to the U.S. dollar. Although investment returns contracted for the year, the steady rise in interest rates contributed to improvement in pension plan funding levels.""Data was a primary focus in the fourth quarter of 2022. Monetary authorities methodically monitored key economic data points to help map their journey to stem elevated inflation, while understanding the economic implications along the path. Paralleling the importance of data, pension plan sponsors also have an important role in aggregating and digesting data, as it enables them to position pension plan investments to deliver value while ensuring long-term sustainability throughout any economic environment, as witnessed through the resilient returns observed this quarter,"" said Katie Pries, President and CEO of Northern Trust Canada.Story continuesThe Northern Trust Canada universe tracks the performance of Canadian institutional defined benefit plans that subscribe to performance measurement services as part of Northern Trust’s asset service offerings.During the quarter, equity and bond markets appeared to demonstrate strength in the face of ongoing restrictive monetary policy. Corporate valuations have been adjusting to the reality of higher interest rates and transitioning to an environment of slower economic growth. Despite the persistent interest rate hikes, the Canadian Bond Universe delivered a slight gain for the period, while equity markets generated attractive returns compared to prior quarters this year.Canadian Equities, as measured by the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, generated 6.0% for the quarter and retreated -5.8% for the year.

All sectors generated positive returns for the quarter, with the exception of Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary, with both sectors also witnessing the largest declines for the year. Energy was the leading performer for both the quarter and the full year.International developed markets, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index, returned 15.8% in CAD for the quarter, while contracting -7.8% in CAD for the year. All sectors posted positive returns for the quarter, with Financials leading the index during the period. The Energy sector experienced the largest gain for the full year followed by Financials, while all remaining sectors declined over the 12-month period.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 8.3% in CAD for the quarter and declined -13.9% in CAD for the year. All sectors produced positive returns for the quarter, with Communication Services leading the group. The Utilities sector generated a positive return for the full year, while all remaining sectors contracted with Information Technology witnessing the steepest decline.The Canadian economy continued to witness a tight labor market, adding approximately 222,000 jobs over the quarter, bringing the unemployment rate down to 5%. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) advanced 6.8% year-over-year in November down slightly from the comparative October print of 6.9%.The U.S. economy continued to witness a strong labor market as approximately 742,000 non-farm payroll jobs were added during the quarter bringing the unemployment rate to 3.5% at the close of the year. The Federal Reserve (Fed), in its effort to bring inflation in line with their target, raised its benchmark overnight rate by 125 basis points in total during the quarter, bringing the target range to 4.25-4.50%.International markets continued to witness elevated inflation, leading the European Central Bank (ECB) to raise interest rates during the quarter by 125 basis points to 2.50%. The Bank of England (BoE) also followed suit, hiking interest rates to 3.50%. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained its level of interest rates, however it surprised markets with the change of its tolerance level on its 10-year government bond yields to +/-0.50% relative to its target of 0%, up from +/-0.25%.Emerging Markets generated positive returns for the quarter, however they continued to lag the developed markets over the period. Despite most major central banks maintaining a tightening tone, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) maintained an accommodative stance, cutting its reserve requirement ratio for banks by 25 basis points and thereby increasing liquidity in the market.The Bank of Canada (BoC) continued with policy tightening, hiking interest rates, with the overnight policy interest rate concluding the quarter at 4.25%. This represented an increase of 400 basis points in aggregate for the full year. With an eye on inflationary pressures and another on economic growth, the BoC will continue to assess how inflation is responding to monetary policy tightening and the impact of this on the economy.The Canadian Fixed Income market, as measured by the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index, advanced 0.1% for the quarter, while declining -11.7% for the year.

Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ on November 14, 2022.

He believes in this situation, investors should pick up higher quality stocks. On August 16, 2022, Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab told CNBC that investors should seek factors such as positive earnings revisions, profitability, strong free cash flow, and healthy balance sheets with high cash and low debt when approaching the market in the presently volatile macro environment.

We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher.

Data analytics company Nielsen may have found out. Americans-- get this-- streamed more than 19 million years' worth of content last year in 2022. That's according to Nielsen. That's up 27% from 2021. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal is here with us. And Allie, clearly lots of binge watching seem to be going on. What shows came out on top?ALLIE CANAL: Oh, yes, and according to this report, the 2022 streaming champion was Netflix. Now Nielsen looked at top overall programs, top originals, top acquired content, and then top streaming movies. And out of all of those categories, Netflix was the winner 39 times out of 58, followed by Disney+ with HBO Max sneaking in there, thanks to ""Friends,"" which, ironically, it acquired from Netflix back in 2020. But if we take a look at the top five overall programs, that included hits like ""Stranger Things,"" ""NCIS,"" ""Encanto.""But I want to zero in on original programming because this is where Netflix really shines, and it's a testament to the steep investments the company has made in its programming over the past years, especially for the more episodic content that we see from them with titles like ""Wednesday,"" ""Ozark,"" ""Bridgerton"" making the top five list. And while Netflix does have a few popular movies, Disney actually had the most success when it comes to streaming films. That Disney IP just seems to hold a lot of weight with consumers and remains one of the main drivers for Disney+ subscriptions.So, super interesting to see all of this data laid out since at the end of the day, the streaming wars is really just a content war. And I think that's why we've seen Netflix continue to be successful and to continue to dominate this space. We'll see if the competition can eventually catch up, especially as they make their own respective investments. But for now, it's clearly a Netflix and chill type of vibe going on out there.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Well, that's not great for this next company we're about to talk about because Comcast out with fourth quarter earnings, and that streaming war tends to get very expensive. And is that what stood out for you from the report as far as Peacock goes?ALLIE CANAL: Absolutely, and it was a very interesting report with Peacock because on the one hand, we did see an addition of 5 million new subscribers, but on the other hand, they reported a loss, nearly $1 billion just in that Peacock division. And this is a narrative that we've really seen across the media sector. More growth usually comes at that pretty steep cost. You can take a look at Disney as another example of this after that company reported a loss of 4 billion plus in its fiscal 2022 results.But on the Comcast earnings call earlier this morning, executives did maintain that they expect peak streaming losses in 2023 estimated at about 3 billion. And they did remain confident that Peacock is the right business model for the company at this time. We heard from Jeff Shell. He's the CEO at NBCUniversal. And he said that they would not be investing in Peacock if they did not expect the streamer to lift the overall media segment to growth over time.Now, over time, that's very broad, and Shell did warn that there are a few macroeconomic factors that could weigh on that timeline, such as the ad market recovery, linear cable declines, cost cuts, et cetera. But for now, it was very clear on the call that they are not abandoning Peacock. They're not abandoning streaming. They do have more than 20 million subscribers on the Peacock app, which is more than double the 10 million users the app had this time last year. So overall, not a bad quarter, but again, those macroeconomic headwinds and those accelerated losses did seem to overshadow things a little bit this morning.]"

The now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange owes money to Apple, Google, Verizon, Netflix and a slew of companies, including BlackRock, that are fixtures of the Fortune 500.On Wednesday, lawyers for FTX submitted the long-anticipated inventory of FTX’s debt in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, which only included names of institutions and companies, not individual creditors. In early January, the federal judge overseeing the case, John Dorsey, ruled that the names of individuals to whom FTX owes money would be sealed for three months.(On Thursday, lawyers for FTX submitted a filing in court warning that the above list isn't necessarily complete and that creditors can be added and removed as FTX and its subsidiaries continue ""to review their books and records."")FTX's high profile creditor list is just the latest update in the legal sprawl that has enveloped the cryptocurrency exchange and its now disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, since his company, once valued at $32 billion, spectacularly collapsed in November.In addition to the above tech behemoths, FTX also may owe money to large airlines, including American, Spirit, and Southwest. Other creditors include the media with The New York Times, VICE, Fox, and CoinDesk among publications listed in the filing. And even universities are on the list, including Stanford, Florida International, and Northeastern.FTX’s lawyers did not include the amount owed to each of the listed creditors, so the exchange’s debt to each company and institution can potentially be as paltry as unpaid subscription fees. Previous court filings, though, show that FTX owes $3.1 billion to its 50 biggest unsecured creditors, with two customers owed more than $200 million each. This is not to mention the approximately 9.7 million redacted customer names who are also ensnared in FTX’s collapse, according to CoinDesk.Story continuesWhile the names of individual creditors are currently sealed, the new legal filing lists Gisele Bundchen Charitable Giving. Gisele Bündchen is the ex-wife of Tom Brady, who was previously reported to own more than 1.1 million shares in the now-defunct exchange and appeared in the company’s Super Bowl ad.The founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, is currently awaiting trial for fraud in October at his parents' home in Palo Alto. In early January, he pled not guilty. Lawyers for FTX’s bankruptcy case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Update, Jan. 26, 2023 at 5:00 p.m.: Following a new court filing, a note has been added clarifying that the list of creditors is provisional.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

Now, don’t misinterpret what I’m trying to say: it’s not that you should avoid growth-oriented names altogether. Rather, it’s a prudent idea to pivot your portfolio to a balanced profile. That way, you can accommodate any variability to your market thesis.While no one can say with absolute authority what will happen in 2023, investors should stay on their guard. For one thing, you have a massive geopolitical conflict in Europe that may not be resolved anytime soon. Further, the Federal Reserve still has much work to do to clamp down on excess liquidity. It’s not out of the realm of possibility, then, to see deflationary pressures.Speaking of deflation, eroding economic sentiment contributed to mass layoffs. Having to digest multiple market catalysts, investors should focus on the best dividend stocks to buy for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co$66.86AEPAmerican Electric Power$92.66PSXPhillips 66$106.94WHRWhirlpool$152.12HRBH&amp;R Block$38.50TSNTyson Foods$66.15KHCKraft Heinz$40.26Southern Co (SO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding company, Southern Co (NYSE:SO) commands extraordinary relevance because of its footprint. According to its public profile, Southern is the second largest utility company in the U.S. in terms of customer base, as of 2021. Although it’s a vital component of the economy, SO didn’t get much love these days. In the trailing year, shares slipped a bit under parity.Nevertheless, this circumstance may change for the better because of Southern’s migration-related advantage. Situated in the southern portion of the U.S. (hence its name), it commands a huge coverage map in Georgia. This is significant because Georgia represents one of the states that millennials are moving to. In particular, young folks have streamed into Atlanta.Story continuesAs a passive income provider, Southern offers a very attractive profile. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 4.05%. This ranks a bit higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, Southern features 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, making it an attractive candidate for best dividend stocks to buy.American Electric Power (AEP)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. Like Southern Co above, American Electric benefits from millennial migration trends. Featuring a coverage map that includes much of the Midwest and eastern states, AEP enjoys a clear advantage.With costs of living skyrocketing in major metropolitan areas, young folks have found refuge in relatively more rural areas. For instance, Virginia – where AEP features a strong presence – offers an attractive alternative to pricey regions. Stated differently, American Electric conducts business where the money will be, not necessarily where it is right now.Just as well, the company provides a solid dividend with a forward yield of 3.6%. Also, it features 13 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Admittedly, its payout ratio of 58.78% is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, it’s within a reasonable level as to not spark alarm bells. Finally, Wall Street analysts love AEP, rating it a consensus strong buy. Thus, it makes a great case for best dividend stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the industry’s value chain. This component covers operations like refining and marketing, as opposed to upstream (exploration and production) and midstream (storage and transportation). Fundamentally, as society reaches full normalization, PSX may skyrocket. Indeed, in the trailing year, it’s already up over 29%.But prospective investors shouldn’t be discouraged. As companies start recalling their workers back to the office, traffic volume will surely increase. For instance, Disney (NYSE:DIS) generated headlines recently when CEO Bob Iger basically put an end to remote operations. While some intrepid workers may go independent and join the gig economy, I’m sure most will fall in line.And with that, you’re talking about a high-probability fundamental catalyst. From this angle alone, PSX ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy. Still, as a bonus, the company carries a forward yield of 3.63%. And a relatively low payout ratio of 31% presents little concern about sustainability.Whirlpool (WHR)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockAn oddity among the best dividend stocks to buy, I genuinely believe investors should watch Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) closely this year. Let me be the first to say that appliance manufacturers represent a boring component of the economy. As well, WHR hasn’t exactly been a friend to long-term stakeholders. In the trailing year, shares slipped over 27%. And in the trailing five years, they’re down 19%.So, what gives? As you know, anything mechanical eventually breaks down. Further, the complexities involved in modern appliances and equipment make (in some cases) out-of-warranty repairs financially non-sensical. Plus, if an appliance breaks down, you tend to want a new one.Now, during the first three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the work-from-home pivot likely accelerated home appliance usage (as opposed to in-office appliances). Therefore, the extra, unplanned usage may accelerate the underlying appliances’ breakdown period.Cynically, then, Whirlpool enjoys upside potential. While you’re waiting for this thesis to pan out, the company offers a forward yield of 4.64%. It’s strange but WHR could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that aligns strongly with the gig economy, H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy. At the very least, you should monitor its progress this year. Granted, its core tax consultancy business doesn’t signal a particularly exciting business. However, it’s going to be among the most relevant, depending on how serious workers want to consider the gig economy.Already, we’re seeing reports globally about people quitting rather than going back to the office. In that case (in the U.S.), gig workers must then transition from filing W-2 forms with the IRS and move to the (dreaded) 1099. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to go over all the differences. However, the key point centers on disclosures. With 1099 forms, you must make more of them.Further, because gig workers report their earnings and legal deductions, mistakes may trigger an IRS action. Therefore, it’s vital that these independent contractors know what they’re doing. H&amp;R Block can help. Plus, the company offers a forward yield of 3.10%.Tyson Foods (TSN)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) represents a vital category in the economy, it hasn’t had a great performance in 2022. Indeed, in the trailing year, TSN gave up nearly 29% of equity value. It’s not just related to technical rumblings. Fundamentally, investors lost confidence in Tyson because of growing margin pressure and operational issues.From this basis, Tyson represents one of the riskier names among the best dividend stocks to buy. At the same time, it’s difficult to be overly negative on food-related enterprises. Unlike companies in the consumer discretionary space, no trade down (cheaper alternative) exists for food. You’re either eating or you’re not.Financially, the troubles did make TSN more attractive. Currently, the company sports a decently stable balance sheet and solid profitability. Better yet, the market prices TSN at 9.65-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 16 times.Finally, Tyson carries a forward yield of just under 3%. Also, it features 11 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Thus, it’s a solid contrarian candidate for best dividend stocks to buy.Kraft Heinz (KHC)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) presents an intriguing narrative for the best dividend stocks to buy. Primarily, it features a generous rate of passive income. At the same time, KHC has been a proven winner. You’re probably not going to get rich off the shares. However, I’ll take a trailing-year performance of 9.6% any time, particularly when the benchmark equities index slipped sharply.Fundamentally, investors should pay close attention to KHC because of the trade-down effect. Assuming economic conditions worsen from here, consumers will start cutting unnecessary expenses and seeking cheaper alternatives to desired products/services. However, you can’t trade down from making your own food at home. Therefore, Kraft Heinz’s core grocery products-related business should blossom.While investors wait for this plotline to pan out, they can collect some sweet passive income. Currently, Kraft Heinz carries a forward yield of 4%. And while its payout ratio at 55.24% is somewhat elevated, it’s arguably not going to cause serious concern. Thus, KHC ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Trading At A 29% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-trading-140011382.html,1674741611,STORY,['AMGN'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Amgen What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.2bUS$10.8bUS$10.7bUS$10.9bUS$11.5bUS$11.7bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.4bUS$12.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.92%Est @ 1.94%Est @ 1.95%Est @ 1.96%Est @ 1.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$9.5kUS$9.4kUS$8.7kUS$8.1kUS$8.0kUS$7.6kUS$7.2kUS$6.9kUS$6.5kUS$6.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$78bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$236bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$236b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$115bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$193b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$257, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.910. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmgenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Biotechs industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Biotechs market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

He added that OPEC had regained its pricing power and would ensure prices remained elevated.The increase in oil prices projected by Goldman Sachs would represent a 22% rise on current levels of around $81.99 for crude oil.The price of a barrel of oil in the US has dipped more than 33% from highs around $122 reached in June last year, amid an increase in stockpiles and a slowdown in global economic demand.Bhandari also said conversations among investors in Europe had been moving from the effects of a Russian price cap to a Russian product embargo, which will involve the EU banning imports of refined Russian products, such as diesel, naphtha and fuel oil, on February 5.""The fifth of February product embargo could be more disruptive to the product prices, not necessarily crude but to the product prices by way of higher refining margins of diesel,"" Bhandari said.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The pre-event favorites in pairs and ice dance, and now leaders after day one, are all in their 30s.World champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier easily took the largest pairs’ short program lead in nationals history in what may be their last U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, eyeing their fourth U.S. title, put up the biggest gap in a U.S. short dance since its inception in 2011.It’s believed that no pair or dance couple of skaters in their 30s has won a U.S. title in more than 50 years.Knierim and Frazier, who last March became the first U.S. pair to win a world title since 1979, tallied 81.96 points to open the four-day nationals on Thursday.They lead by 15.1 over Emily Chan and Spencer Howe going into Saturday’s free skate in San Jose, California, the largest first-day pairs’ gap since the Code of Points replaced the 6.0 scoring system in 2006.FIGURE SKATING NATIONALS: Full Scores | Broadcast ScheduleThe top three pairs from last year’s event — which Knierim and Frazier missed due to him contracting COVID-19 — are no longer competing together. Knierim and Frazier had a clean skate, while Chan and Howe, who entered as silver medal favorites, counted a fall.After nationals, a committee selects three U.S. pairs for March’s world championships in Japan.Before the fall Grand Prix Series, the 31-year-old Knierim said this will probably be their last season competing together, though the pair also thought they were done last spring. They don’t expect to make a final decision until after a Stars on Ice tour this spring.“I don’t like to just put it out there and say it is the last or not going to be the last because life just has that way of throwing curveballs, and you just never know,” Frazier said this month. “But I would say that this is the first nationals where I’m going to go in really trying to soak up every second as if it is my last because you just don’t know.”Story continuesKnierim is going for a fifth U.S. title, which would tie the record for a pairs’ skater since World War II, joining Kyoka Ina, Tai Babilonia, Randy Gardner, Karol Kennedy and Peter Kennedy. Knierim’s first three titles, and her first Olympics in 2018, were with husband Chris, who retired in 2020.Knierim is also trying to become the first female pairs’ skater in her 30s to win a national title since 1993. Knierim and Chock are trying to become the first female skaters in their 30s to win a U.S. title in any discipline since 1995.After being unable to defend their 2021 U.S. title last year, Knierim and Frazier reeled off a series of historic results in what had long been the country’s weakest discipline.They successfully petitioned for an Olympic spot and placed sixth at the Games, best for a U.S. pair since 2002. They considered retirement after their world title, which was won without the top five teams from the Olympics in attendance. They returned in part to compete as world champions and to give back to U.S. skating, helping set up younger pairs for success.They became the first U.S. pair to win two Grand Prix Series events, then in December became the first U.S. pair to make a Grand Prix Final podium (second place). The world’s top pairs were absent; Russians banned due to the war in Ukraine and Olympic champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong from China leaving competition ice (for now).Knierim and Frazier’s real test isn’t nationals. It’s worlds, where they will likely be the underdog to home favorites Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara, who edged the Americans by 1.3 points in the closest Grand Prix Final pairs’ competition in 12 years.Like Knierim and Frazier, Chock and Bates delivered as overwhelming favorites in Thursday’s rhythm dance.The defending champions tallied 91.90 points, distancing Caroline Green and Michael Parsons, who scored 81.40, going into Saturday’s free dance.“Freedom and joy came through right from the start of the program,” Chock said on USA Network. “There was no holding back.”Last year’s silver and bronze medalists aren’t in the field: Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue retired after winning Olympic bronze, while Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker withdrew last week, citing mental health.So Chock, 30, and Bates, 33, are almost certain to make the podium for an 11th consecutive year, which would be one shy of the record for any discipline, and lead the three couples picked for March’s worlds.“We just want to earn it,” Bates said. “Just because we’ve been around longer than most doesn’t necessarily dictate the results.”Bates, who last year became the oldest U.S. champion in any discipline in decades, has made 12 career senior nationals podiums with Chock and former partner Emily Samuelson. It is believed that a 13th finish in the top three would break the U.S. record for a single discipline he currently shares with Michelle Kwan, Nathaniel Niles and Theresa Weld Blanchard.But Chock and Bates’ sights are set on a place they’ve never been — the top step of a world championships podium. They earned silver or bronze a total of three times, including a bronze last year. The gold and silver medalists aren’t competing this season.However, Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier relegated the Americans to silver at December’s Grand Prix Final.“If we don’t win gold at worlds, we’ll be disappointed,” Bates, whose first senior nationals in 2008 came when this year’s women’s singles favorite, Isabeau Levito, was 10 months old, said earlier this month. “We’ve set the goal for ourselves in the past and haven’t met it yet.”Nationals continue later Thursday with the women’s short.NBC Sports’ Sarah Hughes (not the figure skater) contributed to this report.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

All participants will be in listen only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Howard Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our Web site, investorrelations.gd.com. With my introduction complete, I'd turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10,850 million, operating earnings of $1,230 million and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%. So the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects consistent with our forecast and sell side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%, operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%.Story continuesNet earnings by $90 million or 10% and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%, net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1% and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.64, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment. Let me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year.Jason Aiken: Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1 times for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year.After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance. That said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed three potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter; the pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&amp;D expenditures; the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the UK; and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments.As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&amp;D costs, we did not receive any payments from the UK, though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations. I'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022.A - Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release. First, Aerospace. The story in aerospace is found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis. For the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only one more aircraft than we did in 2021.The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis are as attractive because three aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41. As a result, aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year.Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.4 times at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5 times. To give you a little more color, Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past two years, over 400 net orders after default and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022 and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%.We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings. With respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises. In summary, aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet.Next, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than one third of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business with particular strength in artillery rounds. Not surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better.Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9% and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Marine Systems.The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2,970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago, off less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective maybe of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate. In addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2 times book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia.Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings. So Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023.Jason Aiken: The technologies group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and sequentially, were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this.For the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed. With respect to backlog, the Technologies group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition.And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they've been facing. With that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022. Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels.Top Undervalued Tech StocksAndrey Armyagov/Shutterstock.comWe also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022 and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully funds the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past two years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations.However, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher than anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year.We have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. The sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63.And finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe.Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. So let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up. In 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion, up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2. In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed.Continuing the better than expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point. To the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business.As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 at around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies group. To give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single digit pace consistent with the past three years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective.Particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume would yield an operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022. So for 2023, company wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years with sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year.As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital. Let me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&amp;A.A - Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe.

(NYSE:NEE) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 25, 2023Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Jason. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power &amp; Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our fourth quarter and full-year results.Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.Story continuesToday's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power &amp; Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power &amp; Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and therefore 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes.With that, I will turn the call over to John.John Ketchum: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Before I turn to a discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, I'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in media articles and a related complaint filed in October with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete. Regarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles.With respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including by implication FPL. The FEC process is a confidential, civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so. We plan to file our response seeking dismissal of the FEC complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us.With that behind us, I would like to now discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year in 2022 and both businesses have never been better positioned. The cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last two decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward. At the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. Before IRA, we largely qualified for two federal incentives -- wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits.We always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years. Some years they were extended, others they were not. The uncertainty changed customer behavior and it changed our behavior. Today, the incentives are clear. They support a broader range of renewable technologies. They are in place for a much longer period of time. And they incentivize a domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the USA, creating new American jobs. In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that, in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders.So today, I am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners and I look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes. In 2022, NextEra Energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. As a result of strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources, we achieved the high-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. NextEra Energy outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022, despite a challenging year in the financial markets.In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index on a three, five, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both FPL and Energy Resources and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward. We have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 was no exception.Despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in American energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Overcoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. While disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities and I'm extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 in delivering adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14%. During 2022, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in America. Despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class non-fuel O&amp;M cost per megawatt-hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021.We also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills. We placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022 and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023, bringing our total solar buildout to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first two years of our current rate agreement. Our relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1,000 kWh residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in eight years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.Our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Ian and Nicole. And during a year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, FPL used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers. Looking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year. With economics driving strong demand for renewables, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the United States.With the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts, net of projects placed in service, and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead. Our continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables, gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at NextEra Energy. Last June, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader U.S. economy. In August, the IRA helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history. Over the next two decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables, and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage.At FPL, our plan is to lower costs for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage and eventually hydrogen. By transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel-switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of Florida achieve energy independence. Our customers have already seen the positive impacts of the IRA on their bills. We estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. This month, those savings started with a one-time $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate base solar projects. With only about 5% of FPL's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio.At April, FPL expects to file its annual Ten-Year Site Plan, which will present our generation resource plan through 2032. Last year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. By incorporating the IRA benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity in this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. We believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future. At Energy Resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices and the broader push toward decarbonization across the economy enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions.These comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and, in addition to new renewables, can include renewable fuels, hydrogen, and Behind the Meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables. Customers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. And we believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions reduction goals. We are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost-effectively lower emissions.We are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position. We are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way, and we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. Last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog, that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen-related facility in development in the Central United States. Additionally, Energy Resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the Southwest and Southeast.Earlier this month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. In the Southeast, our plan is to support a 140 tons-per-day clean hydrogen facility at our Gulf Clean Energy Center that would be powered by FPL solar projects. In the Southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in Arizona in partnership with Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the United States, with whom we recently signed a memorandum of understanding.The clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the West Coast mobility and industrial end-markets. These are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing. We continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us. At our investor conference in June last year, we announced Energy Resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. In sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then-existing tax law. Typically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior.Then, after tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. Even though tax credits were extended with the IRA, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables. It is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages that today we are extending our development expectations at Energy Resources through 2026. We now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026. If you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new four-year development expectations at Energy Resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous four year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year.To put these numbers into context, just executing at the low-end of our new development expectations through 2026 would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Due to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings per share growth expectations at NextEra Energy by an additional year through 2026. For 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted EPS range.This equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which had another terrific year of execution, while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. For 2022, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by approximately 15% year-over-year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio.This growth is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. Our confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the IRA. Against a backdrop that we believe includes at least two decades of clean energy incentives, we expect NextEra Energy Partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both Energy Resources and from third-parties to continue to be robust. NextEra Energy Partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by NextEra Energy Partners for 2024 through 2026.Additionally, earlier this month NextEra Energy Partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interests on two of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million. These transactions are intended to enable NextEra Energy Partners to take advantage of the IRA's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third-parties. With the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, NextEra Energy Partners can now fully access two cash flow streams for unitholders -- project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of PTCs. Taken together, NextEra Energy Partners expects these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders.The significant tailwinds provided by the IRA and Energy Resources' future renewables outlook, combined with NextEra Energy Partners' third-party M&amp;A and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital, even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility. As a result, today we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NextEra Energy Partners by another year. We now see 12% to 15% per year growth and per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We believe that NextEra Energy Partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition.In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have never been better positioned. We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade. And we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Kirk, I'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we are announcing this morning. After 20 years with NextEra Energy, Eric Silagy has notified me of his intention to retire from FPL, where he has led the team for 11 years. Eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement and under his leadership, FPL has been transformed into the Nation's largest and most reliable electric utility.Over the last decade, Eric has led the efforts to modernize FPL's generating fleet, making it one of the cleanest, lowest-cost and most fuel-efficient in the country. His commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by FPL's award winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average and the best reliability in the country. Last year during hurricanes Ian and Nicole, I saw firsthand Eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the FPL team to quickly restore power and quickly get the State of Florida back on its feet. Over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, Eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. His advocacy across the State has helped to foster Florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system and grow the next generation of Florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments.I want to thank Eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life. With Eric's departure we are excited to welcome Armando Pimentel back to NextEra Energy as FPL's President and CEO. As you know, Armando previously served as NextEra Energy's and FPL's CFO and the President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. As a lifelong Floridian, Armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. He is also a good friend and colleague who I've worked closely with for many years, and I am confident that under Armando's leadership, FPL will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Eric who will make some personal remarks.Eric Silagy: Thank you, John. I want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for NextEra Energy. This company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry and I couldn't be more proud of the results we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. When I joined NextEra Energy in 2003, FPL relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in America. We knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill. Today, that long-term vision has saved FPL customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years.That's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets and helped them to pay for their kids' education, take their families on a vacation or pay for other family expenses. These efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid. And it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations. Ultimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the State of Florida billions of dollars. These are just a few examples of how we have transformed FPL into one of America's cleanest, most affordable and most reliable energy companies. While saying Goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, I know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of FPL.The last year has been one of the most challenging of my career given a number of distractions, including two hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few. When John became CEO of NextEra Energy last year, I committed to him that I would stay in my role for at least one more year and I've now satisfied that commitment. In April I will mark my 20th anniversary with NextEra Energy at which point I will have led the FPL team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most CEO's. We have two more years of execution before our next rate setting proceeding, which as all of you know is an all-consuming process and that I just wasn't sure that I could fully commit to. So, I feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of FPL to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years.It has been the greatest honor of my career to lead the FPL team, and I cannot thank our nearly 10,000 FPL employees and thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting our customers first. They have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day. In my opinion, and I'm a little biased, FPL is the best utility in the world. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished, and it is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. I wish John, Armando and the entire FPL team all the best in their future endeavors. And now let me turn the call over to Kirk for more details.Kirk Crews: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $763 million, or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. For the full-year 2022, FPL reported net income of $3.7 billion, or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion.For the fourth quarter, FPL's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather as well as an approximately $40 million pre-tax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve. For the full-year 2022, FPL's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth, and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion.Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at FPL in 2022. Beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date later this year. Earlier this week, FPL filed with the Florida Public Service Commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. Under our proposed plan, FPL utilize its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April 2023. Additionally, FPL's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel cost recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to FPL's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022.We believe this proposal is a reflection of FPL's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers. Separately, FPL is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. Under FPL's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in April 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms. Taking both proposals together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of April 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for Florida investor-owned utilities. The Florida economy remains strong.Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs, and Florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although we have seen the growth rate stabilize, three-month average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior-year, including an 11% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies.Photo by RawFilm on UnsplashDuring the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. For 2022, FPL's retail sales increased 1% from the prior-year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income of $996 million, or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million, or $0.20 per share. For the full-year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $285 million, or $0.40 per share, and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion, or $1.23 per share.The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources full-year GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Energy Resources' full-year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. As we previously highlighted, the Commerce Department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. As a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022.We anticipate that Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023, when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. Our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year-over-year. All other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt balances reflecting growth in the business. Additional details of our full-year 2022 results at Energy Resources are shown on the accompanying slide. As John mentioned, Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects.Since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar and 670 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals but, perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar, and solar-plus-storage. Today, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the IRA.Our revised expectations are by far the largest expected four-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. The accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers, and we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of China.We believe the Commerce Department's preliminary determination on circumvention of anti-dumping and countervailing duties late last year clarified that solar panels manufactured in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China are not circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. We are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the two-year waiver period. Finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.52 billion, or $0.76 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1 billion, or $0.51 per share, respectively.For the full-year 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.15 billion, or $2.10 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share. For the Corporate &amp; Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full-year were roughly flat compared to the prior-year. As John mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all sectors. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy and this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings. Additionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow and in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year-over-year, despite FPL being under-recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes Ian and Nicole.As a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities. Finally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. As John discussed, today we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up approximately 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. Fourth quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners' operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year. For the full-year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021.Existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, with the benefits of higher net generation for both wind and solar partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021. NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full-year. Relative to the growth in NextEra Energy Partners' full-year adjusted EBITDA, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit, or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year-over-year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the IPO. During 2022, NextEra Energy Partners executed several low-cost financings continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. During the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years, to be funded by the investor's share of ongoing portfolio cash flows.In December, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon, which along with the capped call entered into at the time of the financing provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the NEP unit price at the time of issuance. The implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. These transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of NextEra Energy Partners' successful financing execution throughout 2022. In May 2022, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available.With this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners still has $6 billion of Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for maturities or net new issuances. Taken together, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set which has expanded as a result of the IRA.This significant opportunity set and NextEra Energy Partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners' run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution at December 31, 2023 remain unchanged.Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near-term and long-term. Near-term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. Long-term, we believe that the low cost of renewables combined with other clean energy solutions enabled in part by the IRA provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future.That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.See also 25 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military Power and 10 Most Advanced Battery Technologies.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Worried investors who have lost a massive amount of wealth since late 2021 continue to take refuge in safe investments that could preserve their capital and earn regular returns.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of December dropped to 6.5% after record highs in September and August 2022. Though the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting monetary policy began to yield results, its 2% inflation mark for a balanced economy seems a distant reality. The cenral bank will continue to increase the overnight interest rate, though the pace of rate hike in terms of percentage points could be lower, keeping in mind the recent developments.In its fight against inflation, the Fed raised the key interest rate seven times in 2022 and is expected to continue to do the same in 2023, thereby making it the highest in 15 years. Due to the high borrowing cost, which Americans are not comfortable with, it is that expected there will be slower growth and higher unemployment in recent times.Globally, geopolitical tensions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and Russia have created the worst energy crises in recent decades, causing a global supply-chain disturbance. Slowdown in growth and high inflation prevail in many countries due to high energy prices. Also, China has slowly started to recover from the last COVID resurgence. The country will take time to regain former efficiency. All these have disrupted the global supply-chain mechanism.Thus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in matured businesses with a regular dividend payout. These stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Investors can expect a regular flow of income along with the preservation of capital against volatile market conditions.

But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) share price is down 27% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 6.9%. Zooming out, the stock is down 22% in the last three years.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last year, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. Check out our latest analysis for Tyson Foods While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Tyson Foods share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 7.4%. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Tyson Foods managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthTyson Foods is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Tyson Foods in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.9% in the twelve months, Tyson Foods shareholders did even worse, losing 25% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. If you would like to research Tyson Foods in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.Story continuesOf course Tyson Foods may not be the best stock to buy.

202,1b183e06-c591-36e7-8217-cf500035619c,TSN,2023-01-27,Bill Gates says fake meat products will eventually be 'very good' — here are 3 alternative protein stocks to take advantage,MoneyWise,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-says-fake-meat-140000736.html,1674741600,STORY,"['BYND', 'TSN']","[Bill Gates says fake meat products will eventually be 'very good' — here are 3 alternative protein stocks to take advantageWhile the debate over fake meat rages on and the industry declines, the most prominent investor in the space is still keeping the faith. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates recently said he expects faux meat brands will win over consumers someday.“I think eventually these products will be very good even though their share is small today,” he said in a Reddit post recently.And he’s put his money where his mouth is too. Gates has backed several high-profile startups in this space, including Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Impossible Foods and Upside Foods, which was previously known as Memphis Meats.But for the “clean” alternatives to meat to appeal to more than just vegans, Gates added they need to be as affordable (and tasty) as the traditional products.Don't miss'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsHowever, considering that fake meat brands have been swept up in the ongoing culture war, there’s no guarantee that Gates’s vision will become reality.The backlash against “woke capitalism” and the rising cost of food in general has evaporated the sales of fake meat in recent months. And it’s got some investors saying the sector may be based on a passing fad, while others expect the industry to grow 19.3% on average every year until 2030.If you’re as optimistic as Gates and industry analysts are, here are the top three stocks you should add to your watch list.Beyond MeatBeyond Meat is an obvious choice. For mainstream consumers, the Los Angeles-based brand is synonymous with plant-based meat alternatives. For investors, on the other hand, it’s synonymous with “bubble stock.”Story continuesAfter tripling in value during the pandemic, Beyond Meat stock has lost about 75% of its market value in the last 12 months.In its most recent quarter, sales declined 23% while profit margins remained negative. The company’s future depends on whether it can turn things around and boost sales in 2023.Now, the stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.3, which is in line with the S&amp;P 500’s average P/S ratio of 2.42. Put simply, this is a risky bet for any investor willing to take a contrarian approach.Read more: Boomers’ remorse: Here are the top 5 ‘big money’ purchases you’ll (probably) regret in retirement and how to offset themTyson FoodsArkansas-based Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is on the other end of the spectrum from Beyond Meat. It’s an 88-year old meat producer with significant market share across North America and the rest of the world. The company has tried to enter the fake meat market multiple times, most recently in 2021.However, sales in the company’s “processed food” segment, which includes fake meat, has been relatively flat in recent quarters. Fake meat and vegan alternatives remain a small fraction of Tyson’s overall sales.Tyson could be an ideal pick for conservative investors. The company is poised for robust and steady growth as traditional meat remains in demand. But if Bill Gates is right and fake meat sales skyrocket, Tyson won’t be left out of the market shift.Put simply, it’s a safe bet.IngredionIngredion Incorporated (NYSE: INGR) rarely gets mentioned but it’s a key player in this sector. The Winchester-based company supplies raw material to the world’s biggest food producers, including the pea-based proteins used by fake meat producers across the world.Sales surged 15% in the most recent quarter, while net profit soared 17%. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.4. It’s an undervalued bet on the innovation in the global food industry, not just fake meats.What to read nextHere's the golden secret to making your retirement fund as secure as Fort KnoxYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Americans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Tesla closing up just about 11%, the leader in the NASDAQ 100 today, closing at its highest level that we've seen in the last six months after fourth quarter results came in better than feared. Now, Wall Street reacting positively to the numbers and the comments about strong demand from CEO Elon Musk. We have Citigroup, Bank of America, Wolfe Research, Wells Fargo, Cowen, Wedbush among the names they're raising their price targets today.And, Dave, taking a look at the momentum that we're clearly seeing in Tesla stock, we talked to Gary Black earlier in the show. He's a future fund managing partner there. Clearly, a Tesla bull. He was saying that the Cybertruck is going to be one of the huge catalysts, get people back on the hype train when it comes to Tesla, and really take it back to those higher levels that we had seen. When you check out some of the losses that we've seen over the last 12 months, I'm not sold yet. But, clearly, the Street very encouraged by what we did get from Tesla and by the commentary that we heard from Musk.- Are you on team Briggs with the Cybertruck because, look, I just don't see it.- And you love pickup trucks. You love trucks.- I love trucks. And I love Teslas. But that car will not be driven by most Americans. It, frankly, will not. And people always use the preorders as the real catalyst. Those preorders are fully refundable. $100 fully refundable deposit. I'm not buying it. But he also pointed out they're not just a car company, Gary Black, pointing out that megapacks, for example, could be a real catalyst for tremendous earnings down the road.But he said something really interesting as well about Elon Musk's macro talk about the economy. He said investors really don't pay attention to it. But the problem is Elon Musk on that call really undermined his own argument on that call by saying we're going to go through a pretty difficult recession and then saying he sees skyrocketing demand for very expensive EV that is the Tesla, and the potential for 2 million. So how do you-- even if he's wrong, how does he justify in that brilliant mind that there's going to be a recession while there's going to be tremendous demand for Teslas? I don't see it.Story continues- Yeah. Something's not adding up there. But I think maybe the positive spin on this, at least from the Street's perspective-- Deutsche Bank did weigh in on this. If, in fact, we do see a slowdown, they were saying, obviously, not great for Tesla. But the company is better positioned given its cash position, given the levers that it does have at its disposal than some of the competitors out there. But you got a question if we do head for a recession, maybe a larger downturn than what we are anticipating at this point, it's not going to be good for Tesla. It's not to be good for many consumer-facing companies.- Yeah. I would have just liked to hear his justification for why he sees that coming. Just one other note. His CFO I thought was interesting in saying we're going to, quote, ""attack every area of cost."" That does play into the potential for recession. And maybe that's helpful in cutting the cost of the supply chain. So that was interesting. All right. More earnings news. Reaction in the market today with several airlines moving following quarterly reports. American, JetBlue, and of course the one we've all been waiting for, Southwest reporting today.But you can see Southwest the loser of the bunch today. The company revealing an $800 million loss due to that holiday travel meltdown in December. Their CEO Bob Jordan telling Bloomberg, quote, ""we know for a fact we were absolutely staffed to operate our schedules. I do not believe the issue is staffing."" Now, these comments coming on the same day Southwest says it plans to hire 7,000 workers in 2023. So still a bit of a mixed picture from the airline after it canceled 16,000-plus flights in late December.And that isn't just a drag on this quarter, but probably Q1 2023 and, Seana, quite frankly, maybe well after. Remember, their pilot captain of the union Casey Murray told us-- I asked him, if you were a customer right now, would you fly Southwest? And he said point blank no, no way, and laid out the reasons for it.- Yeah. I think we're certainly are seeing some of that overhang from all the flights. Over 16,000 flights canceled. Clearly, they are seeing cancellations, something that CEO Bob Jordan talked about on the earnings call. What surprised me was the fact that he only sees this as being Q1 issue. I do tend to agree with you, Dave, that I have a hard time buying that maybe some people are going to be a little hesitant when booking with Southwest into Q2, maybe even Q3.But when you take a look at these numbers, clearly, it's going to be a challenging several months here for the airline. The company did say that they do expect a negative revenue impact of $350 million to $350 million in the current quarter. Whether or not that of course drags on to the second quarter only time will tell. CEO Bob Jordan also going on to say that they are working with a consulting firm to try to determine some of those issues. To address those issues, it's going to take a huge investment. And like we've talked about time and time again, it's a fix that's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time. So Southwest currently has their work cut out for them.- I was just curious why you thought JetBlue was down slightly on a really good report. Is that because the good news is already baked in? They've already have had a pretty solid month?- Yeah. They've had a pretty solid month. And when you take a look at some of those larger charts, you have seen-- longer term charts, I should say. You have seen a bit of a rebound more recently, the stock barely closing negative there. But like you were saying, it was a very different quarter than what we just heard from Southwest. They said that they were on track to deliver those cost reductions that they had been targeting of $250 million through 2024. The CEO saying that the demand environment remains solid this year. So, clearly, totally different picture over at JetBlue.Let's take a look at Mastercard because shares at the credit card company closing lower here. You can see it off just over 1% after the company warned that revenue growth could slow faster than expected in the current quarter. Still, though, Mastercard's CEO saying in a statement that, quote, ""while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient."" He then went on to say, ""we are well prepared to adjust our investment profile quickly if needed.""So it's interesting just to weigh that against the reaction that we're seeing in the stock price today. And taking a look at the analyst reaction here, they actually said that trends in January look, quote, unquote, ""healthy"" so far. So a drop of 1%, not too much to be worried about.- No. And it's so interesting. Again and again and again we hear these predictions of recession. And more from the earnings call from their CEO, pointed out strong labor market, low unemployment, rising wages, elevated consumer savings levels. And it's a lot like we heard from Paul Riley, Raymond James CEO, early in the show saying, I just don't see it. We don't see it in our clients. We don't see it in our customers. But we're going to prepare for it. So it's a strange dichotomy going on with this economy where everyone's coming out and saying we don't see a recession in our customers and our clients, but we're going to potentially prepare.- Hopefully, we don't see it.- Yeah. Hopefully, we do not.]"

What's more, the company is guiding for an adjusted loss of $0.15 per share in Q1. Wall Street was looking for a profit of $0.25 per share.Here are the most important numbers from the announcement compared to what analysts anticipated, as compiled by Bloomberg.Revenue: $14 billion versus $14.4 billion expectedAdjusted EPS: $0.10 versus $0.19 expectedClient Computing: $6.6 billion versus $7.4 billion expectedDatacenter and AI: $4.3 billion versus $4 billion expectedShares of Intel were off more than 5% immediately following the announcement.Intel's Q1 expectations aren't much better than its Q4 performance. The company said it expects revenue of between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The Street was looking for $14 billion. Gross margins are also expected to come in at 39%. Analysts anticipated margins to top 45.5%.Intel is facing a steep drop in consumer PC sales, as shoppers choose to hold on to the laptops and desktops they purchased at the peak of the pandemic. According to Gartner, Q4 worldwide PC shipments declined a stunning 28.5%, the biggest decline since the firm started following shipments in the mid-1990s.Intel's Client Computing Group was hammered in the quarter, with revenue declining 36% year-over-year from $10.3 billion to $6.6 billion.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Intel's Datacenter and AI business also took a beating, with revenue declining 33% year-over-year from $6.4 billion to $4.3 billion.Intel should serve as a kind of bellwether for the chip industry, as it is among the first of the major semiconductor firms to announce its results. Rival AMD (AMD) will report earnings on Jan. 31, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will announce its earnings on Feb. 2. Graphics chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), meanwhile, will report its earnings on Feb. 22.Story continuesIntel is in the midst of a rebuild of sorts, as CEO Pat Gelsinger attempts to restore the storied company to prominence among chip designers and manufacturers. To that end, he’s building out massive fabrication facilities around the world including a $20 billion plant in Ohio.Intel’s stock price has been hammered over the last year.

212,6564cfdf-fe1a-3a20-8483-dc05a9121773,QCOM,2023-01-27,Earnings Preview: Qualcomm (QCOM) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-qualcomm-qcom-q1-150103334.html,1674745263,STORY,"['QCOM', 'JNPR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Qualcomm (QCOM) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27.2%.Revenues are expected to be $9.7 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.56% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm?For Qualcomm, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qualcomm will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of $3.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.13, delivering a surprise of +0.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Qualcomm doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, Juniper Networks (JNPR) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +16.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Juniper has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.89%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Juniper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Zacks Market Edge Podcast Episode #1, posted on Oct 13, 2015, was called ""Is it Time to Invest in Greece?"". Some of you might remember that Greece went through a tough round of austerity measures after the Great Recession and was still recovering in 2015. Additionally, while tourism was hitting all-time highs, the problem of over tourism was real.Tourist hot spot, Santorini, moved to limit the number of cruise ships it allowed in port as some of its towns were getting overwhelmed with day tourists.But the pandemic put a pause on tourism across Greece, and the world, for over 2 years.What will it look like going forward?Microsoft and Alphabet Make InvestmentsIn 2015, Tracey and Harry talked about the Greek Millennial ""brain drain"" to other job centers like Berlin and London, as that's where the jobs and opportunities were.Story continuesBut while there is still some of that happening in 2023, the Greek government is pushing for more digital jobs. In 2023, there are global businesses coming to Greece.In 2020, Microsoft MSFT announced plans to open a data center in Greece, and in Nov 2022, Alphabet GOOGL announced it was also investing in the country with the possibility of hiring as many as 20,000 by the end of the decade.Microsoft has over 200,000 employees worldwide while Alphabet has about 187,000.Tourism Still the Leading IndustryBut tourism is still the leading industry, both on mainland Greece and the islands.1.      Airbnb ABNBAirbnb is now a big business globally, especially in Greece. Harry discussed how some investors are buying up entire buildings in, and around Athens, to put them on Airbnb.Shares of Airbnb have plunged in the last year, however. They're down 33.6% during that time but they've rallied in the last month, adding 22.1%.Airbnb still isn't cheap on a forward P/E basis. It trades at 37.6x.Should you be investing in Airbnb for its international growth?2.      Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE Expedia has been around for several decades, but now that the global travel industry has reopened, the online travel company is back in the spotlight.Expedia shares are also down big in the last year, falling 33.7%. And they, too, have rallied in the last month as the airlines report strong bookings through the summer months, an indication that people are still eager to travel. Shares are up 33% during that time.But Expedia IS actually cheap on a forward P/E basis, with a P/E of just 12.6.Should Expedia be on your short list as a way to invest in global growth?3.      Booking Holdings Inc. BKNGBooking Holdings is one of the world's largest online travel companies. You can book Greek hotels on it.Over the last year, shares of Booking are actually up, but just 2.4%. In the last month, like Expedia and Airbnb, Booking shares have soared 22%.Booking is more expensive than Expedia, on a P/E basis, with a forward P/E of 20.Is Booking getting ready to break out in 2023 as global travel picks up momentum?What Else do you Need to Know About Cashing in on Greece's Growth?

215,895a76c7-2d4e-3c6e-999b-604024af480e,EXPE,2023-01-27,3 Must-Buy Stocks if the Ukraine War Ends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-must-buy-stocks-ukraine-142718813.html,1674484038,STORY,"['CLF', 'F', 'EXPE']","[Although it may feel to many like the Russia-Ukraine War could last for a decade, the Rand Corporation, a prominent American think tank, recently outlined several scenarios that could cause the war to end relatively soon. Among these  events are Russian President Putin falling from power and the collapse of the Russian Army. Additionally, I would add that there are signs that the support for Ukraine in  European nations is waning significantly, and that could force the EU and the U.S. to seek a peace deal sooner than many expect. If the war does end or appears to be winding down sooner than the Street anticipates, the sectors whose products utilize large amounts of oil and/or natural gas are likely to get the biggest lifts. Here are three stocks to buy within three such sectors.TickerCompanyPriceEXPEExpedia$111.30CLFCleveland Cliffs$20.97FFord$12.40Expedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comTravel is already booming. But the huge drop in oil prices triggered by an end to the Russia-Ukraine War would lower the cost of airline tickets a great deal. As a result, the travel boom would strengthen and last for a longer time. Of course, that would be great news for Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), the gigantic online travel agency.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdditionally, lower gasoline prices, in general, would give consumers globally more disposable income to spend on travel, greatly lifting the demand for Expedia’s travel deals.Also noteworthy is that an end to the Russia-Ukraine War would lower gasoline prices in Europe more than in most other areas, giving tens of millions of Europeans the ability to travel more extensively.The forward price-earnings ratio of EXPE stock is a rather low 12.4, making EXPE among the top stocks to buy even if the war doesn’t end anytime soon.Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)the Cleveland-Cliffs stock) logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCleveland Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) says that it “is the largest supplier of automotive steel in the US.” If the Russia-Ukraine War ends, resulting in a large decline in oil and gasoline prices, the demand for automobiles in general and steel-intensive SUVs, in particular, will likely surge tremendously, greatly boosting Cleveland Cliffs’ financial results and providing CLF stock with a big lift.Story continuesMoreover, since significant amounts of fossil fuel are used to make steel, Cleveland Cliffs’ raw material costs should drop meaningfully when the Russia-Ukraine War ends, significantly lifting its margins and its bottom line. Thus, CLF is one of the top stocks to buy if the war in Ukraine ends.Also noteworthy is that CLF should be meaningfully helped by Washington’s spending on infrastructure that’s being unleashed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.On Jan. 12, Morgan Stanley upgraded CLF stock to “overweight” from “equal weight,” citing the company’s recent price hikes.Finally, the shares have a very attractive forward price-earnings ratio of just 9.5, while their price-sales ratio is a minuscule 0.47.Ford (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comYou may have seen this one coming since I mentioned earlier that “the demand for automobiles in general and steel-intensive large vehicles, in particular, will likely surge tremendously” if the war ends. Indeed, if such a scenario unfolds, it definitely makes sense to buy the shares of Ford (NYSE:F), which manufactures America’s most popular pickup truck, the F150.In December, showing that lower gasoline prices are already greatly increasing F150 sales, Ford’s sales of the pickups jumped 20% year-over-year to over 75,000. For the year, however, the truck’s sales dropped 10%. If the war ends, causing oil prices to tumble, the pent-up demand for F150s is likely to be huge.Additionally, Ford could be boosted going forward by improved macroeconomic conditions in Europe, particularly if the war winds down, and by China’s reopening.And changing hands at a very low forward price-earnings ratio of just 6.9 times, F stock is a bargain at its current levels.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

But there could be something even scarier on the horizon than a hawkish Fed: doomsday.On Tuesday, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reset the Doomsday Clock at 90 seconds until midnight, with midnight representing world apocalypse.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists created the Doomsday Clock in 1947 to “convey how close humanity is to destroying itself.” With the latest reset of its symbolic hands, the clock is closer to midnight than ever before.“We are living in a time of unprecedented danger, and the Doomsday Clock time reflects that reality,” says Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in a statement.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of nuclear weapons use, raised the specter of biological and chemical weapons use, hamstrung the world’s response to climate change, and hampered international efforts to deal with other global concerns,” the organization explains.No one wants to see the end of humanity. But prepping for worst-case scenarios — both at home and in your investment portfolio — might not be such a bad idea.Here are three stocks to check out before the Doomsday Clock strikes 12.Don't missUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead.

Therefore food companies, like Conagra Brands (NYSE: CAG), could be worth considering if you want to get ready.Headquartered in Chicago, Conagra is deeply entrenched in the consumer packaged food industry. Its portfolio includes many iconic brands, such as Birds Eye, Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice, and Slim Jim.Story continuesEven though the pandemic-induced food hoarding has long stopped, Conagra continues to grow its business.In the fiscal quarter that ended Nov. 27, 2022, net sales increased 8.3% while adjusted earnings per share rose 26.6% to 81 cents.The stock is also showing its resilience: Conagra shares climbed 5% in the past 12 months, in stark contrast to the S&amp;P 500’s 8% decline over the same period.Lockheed MartinSpeaking of share price performance, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is even more impressive than Conagra: the stock is up 17% over the past year.But this shouldn’t come as a surprise. Known for its F-35 fighter jets, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world by revenue.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Hope you've all had a good start to the new year, and I thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2023. I'd like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and from the year, and then Jay will review the financials in a more detailed manner. Lockheed Martin had a strong close to 2022. All of our business areas met or exceeded our prior expectations, resulting in a 2022 full year sales of $66 billion, segment operating profit of $7.2 billion and earnings per share of $21.66. Our free cash flow for the year of $6.1 billion also came in above our prior expectation, while backlog for the year increased to $150 billion, driven by all-time record orders for Lockheed Martin.Story continuesOur financial results included more than $1.7 billion of independent research and development investments, or IRAD, a new high watermark for the company. We also continue to modernize and streamline our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Significant capital projects include our ongoing investment in what we call One Lockheed Martin transformation or 1LMX. This is our multiyear internal project to transform our business processes and systems from end-to-end. By implementing new digital tools in our operations and expanding our use of model-based engineering to enhance our speed to market and our cost competitiveness. In 2022, we completed a majority of the detail design for our new systems and business processes. And for 2023, we expect to complete the detailed design and implementation road maps that go with it, and then we'll transition to the system build and configuration phase over the next couple of years.These IRAD and capital investments accelerate the capabilities our customers need and for our operations to efficiently and effectively meet those needs. From a capital return perspective, we delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 via share repurchases of $7.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion. During the fourth quarter specifically, we entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we've retired approximately 7 million shares under that agreement so far. We expect to complete our remaining repurchase authorization of $10 billion over the next few years, consistent with our focus to deliver free cash flow per share growth to you, the investor. These operational and financial results created significant value for our shareholders, ending the year with a total shareholder return of 40%.I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense, or DoD, budget. In late December, Congress signed the FY '23 Omnibus spending bill into law, appropriating $858 billion for National Defense, including $817 billion for the DoD-based budget. This reflects approximately 10% growth year-over-year for both national defense and the DoD-based budget. The law also represents a 6% or $45 billion increase from the President's budget request for DoD. These appropriations enabled us, along with the Joint Program Office, to finalize the contract for the production and delivery of up to 398 F-35 for $30 billion in Lots 15 and 16, including the option for Lot 17. Further, several other of Lockheed Martin programs received the funding levels necessary to drive the growth outlook we previously identified, including our combat rescue helicopter, the C-130J, Blackhawk, CH-53K and FAAD.We view this funding outcome as positive for the future, and our current expectation is that growth will materialize over the longer term, starting in 2024. Let's now turn to the four growth pillars: programs of record, hypersonics, classified activities and new awards. With regard to programs of record, there were several important developments in key signature programs in our fourth quarter. On the F-35, the definitization of Lots 15 to 17, as I mentioned a minute ago, included the first F-35 aircraft to be produced for Belgium, Finland and Poland. We received authorization to procure long lead items for Lot 18 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. allies as well. We also formally welcome Germany, the ninth foreign military sales country, to the F-35 Lightning II program.And earlier in January, Canada officially became an F-35 operator as the country selected the aircraft to replace its aging fighter fleet. We continue to expect deliveries of the F-35 to ramp to 156 by 2025. Despite the temporary pause in flight operations and corresponding suspension of engine deliveries that began in December and resulted in the delivery of just 141 F-35s in 2022, seven shy of our expectation of 148 before the engine issue was discovered. Also in the quarter, the U.S. Navy authorized the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter to enter full rate production and then its deployment phase. This important milestone allows the program to proceed beyond low-rate initial production. And this achievement attests to our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps and instills confidence and stability in Sikorsky's diverse domestic supply chain.In addition, at Sikorsky, international demand for the Black Hawk remains strong. Last week, the Australian Army announced it will acquire 40 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to replace its current multi-role helicopter fleet. Deliveries are expected to begin for Australia this year. Further, the Lockheed Martin built Orion exploration class spacecraft launched on NASA's ARTEMIS 1 and completed a 25-day flight test, slashing down off the coast of California. This successful mission takes us one step closer to the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon. On its journey, Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles through deep space and surpassed records for total distance. It traveled 270,000 miles from home and the farthest distance from earth by a spacecraft designed to carry humans.We look forward to the next stages of the program with seven additional missions under contract. Turning to hypersonics. In December, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted a hypersonic-boosted flight test of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon. This was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile, meeting all its objectives for the test, including reaching speeds of greater than 5 times the speed of sound. With regard to classified programs, we achieved successful milestones across multiple business areas in 2022 and grew 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in classified that will outpace the rest of the portfolio over the next several years. And finally, at new awards, Lockheed Martin's Next-Generation Interceptor, or NGI, continues to make progress.In late October, we announced the delivery of the first NGI flight software package to the Missile Defense Agency, providing the framework of software development tools, process workflows, scripts and environments. The delivery was ahead of schedule and is a critical step on the path for flight testing and fielding. This program remains a focused competition for Lockheed Martin with the first NGI forecast for delivery in 2027. With regard to the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, competition, we were disappointed in the U.S. Army's decision. And upon review, we determined a formal protest by Sikorsky on behalf of Team Defiant to be the best course of action. We continue to believe that Defiant X with its increased speed, range, manoeuvrability and survivability is the transformational and most cost-effective aircraft that best meets the selection criteria for this competition.Sikorsky remains one of two competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative that's called the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, which is currently expected to be awarded in 2025. The first RatorX-competitive prototype is over 90% complete and has more than 65% of its acceptance testers already done. Sikorsky is the only company with a representative FARA technology demonstrator aircraft. I saw it fly down at West Palm Beach a few months ago. It's amazing, the S97 RAIDER, which has completed more than 110 flight hours. In November, Norway became the first international customer for our new TPY 4 radar. It's the first software-defined radar that outperforms in target detection, mission diversity and transportability.Photo by Norbert Braun on UnsplashNorway is going to receive eight of Lockheed Martin's TPY-4 RAIDERs with options for three additional RAIDERs. Finally, backlog ended 2022 at $150 billion with book-to-bill at 1.2 times and increases in every business area across Lockheed Martin. This strong demand signal bodes well for future growth over the longer term for our company. So these four pillars will guide us as we face a challenging geopolitical environment and apply growth and integrated capabilities mindset to everything we do here. As conflict continues in Ukraine, unfortunately, and projected global threats require coordinated efforts to protect the U.S. and our allied territories, ongoing progress in our 21st Century Security vision will enable the acceleration of advanced capabilities to defer these threats and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations for our military service customers.In the fourth quarter, we continued to announce and expand strategic agreements with America's leading commercial digital companies, such as IBM's Red Hat, to advance artificial intelligence innovation on Lockheed Martin military platforms; and for Microsoft, with whom we're going to help power classified cloud advanced technologies for the Department of Defense. Microsoft's latest secure framework will make Lockheed Martin the first non-government entity to independently operate inside the Microsoft Azure Government Secret Cloud, ushering in a new era of cloud opportunities for the industry. As we look ahead, demand for Lockheed Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United States and abroad. We continue to expect 2023 sales about the same level as we discussed back in October.We also continue to expect a return to sustained top line growth in 2024 and beyond as headwinds diminish in our program mix, the supply chain continues to recover and our signature programs grow. Free cash flow per share will remain a key focus as we maximize returns for you, our shareholders. 2022 is a year of great accomplishments for our company in the face of a lot of dynamic challenges. The outstanding achievements of our teams resulted from real deep commitments across our business areas and better cooperation among them as well as our corporate functions to develop, produce and deliver world-class systems to our country and its allies. Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 116,000 team members and the values we all share.So with that, let me hand it off to Jay to give more color on the financials, and we'll join you later to answer your questions. Jay?Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results for 2022, additional business area detail and offer a first full look at 2023 guidance. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart three, an overview of our consolidated 2022 financials. Lockheed Martin followed up a solid third quarter with a strong finish to 2022, highlighted by 7% year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter and effectively managed a turbulent year impacted by COVID and supply chain disruptions as well as inflation levels not seen in decades. Besides sales, we also exceeded our expectations for segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow, all while absorbing incremental headwinds tied to restructuring activities within RMS and mark-to-market losses in our investment portfolios.We also booked record orders in 2022, resulting in 11% growth to an ending backlog of $150 billion. In addition to our orders on F-35, we experienced a surge in new interest for our industry-leading security solutions, such as in classified programs in Space and in Missiles and Fire Control, where we booked approximately $1.5 billion in orders, reflecting increased demand to replenish U.S. stocks and enhance security positions globally. And we delivered on our commitment to boost shareholder returns by deploying nearly $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making significant investments in our businesses. Taken together, these results demonstrate the perseverance of our dedicated employees to perform in challenging environments and support our expectations for 2023 and beyond.Taking a closer look at full year results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart four. Sales came in higher than expected by nearly $750 million, limiting the decline to 2% year-over-year and essentially recovering to the sales guidance we had originally communicated last January. The stronger-than-expected performance was broad-based across all four business areas and reflects strong coordination with supplier partners to drive material throughput and program schedule performance as well as some favourable award timing, which drove additional revenue. Segment operating profit declined 2% year-over-year but also finished higher than expected by almost $50 million driven by the higher sales. Operating margins settled at 10.9%, slightly lower year-over-year and versus expectations based on lower net favourable profit adjustments.Moving to earnings per share on Chart five. Adjusted earnings per share grew 2% for the year as the benefit from share repurchases overcame headwinds from lower segment profit and FAS/CAS pension income. Moving to cash flow on Chart six. We delivered $6.1 billion of free cash flow for the year while investing almost $1.7 billion in CapEx at a ratio of 1.4 times depreciation. We also ended the year with nearly $1.5 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers, maintaining our commitment to a resilient supply chain. As I noted earlier, 2022 represented a significant year of cash deployment. In total, we returned 178% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022, leveraging our performance and strong balance sheet while still investing for our anticipated growth trajectory in 2024 and beyond.Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart seven. Full year sales grew 1% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in our classified programs, partially offset by lower F-35 production volume. Operating profit increased 2% driven by higher net favourable profit adjustments more than offsetting the impact of the lower volume. For the year, backlog at Aeronautics grew 15%. As mentioned, Aeronautics completed the F-35 Lot 15 through 17 negotiations and secured production volumes while providing the services with a value proposition that combines the highest performance at affordable cost. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page eight. Sales decreased 3% driven primarily by lower volume on our special ops sustainment program following the Afghan withdrawal, along with lower volume on sensors programs.Segment operating profit was down 1% with lower favourable profit adjustments primarily on PAC-3. For the year, backlog increased 6% on the back of tactical missile strength. At Rotary and Mission Systems on Page nine, sales decreased year-over-year by 4% driven primarily by a non-recurring revenue event in our training business in 2021 along with lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 7%, following Sikorsky and C6ISR volume and lower favourable profit adjustments on the Black Hawk program. Backlog grew 4% in 2022, led by the Defense of Guam award, where RMS will be the lead integrator of the multi-domain air and missile defense system as well as stronger Sikorsky orders. Turning to Chart 10 in our Space business area.Sales decreased 2% due to the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program, partially offset by growth on a Next-Generation Interceptor program and national security space. Operating profit decreased 8% with lower net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Backlog grew 16% based on strong classified program captures and Orion orders. So all told, a strong finish to the year. So let's now shift to 2023 on Page 11. Before introducing our expectations, I'd like to inform you of a reporting change in segment operating profit starting in 2023. We will report purchased intangible asset amortization expense in unallocated corporate expense below segment operating profit. Previously, intangible amortization was included in segment operating profit.This change will not impact total earnings, and we believe the change provides a more accurate view of operating performance for each of our four business areas. The impact is approximately 40 basis points on our 2023 expectations, consistent with the impact in previous years. Our 2023 financial outlook includes the impact of this change, and you can find supporting data for these adjustments in the appendices of our web charts as well as in the earnings release. Okay, let's get into the outlook for 2023. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion and the midpoint is slightly below 2022. Speaking to the timing of sales this year, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year, ramping up quarter-over-quarter as we did in 2022.Segment operating profit for 2023 normalized for intangible asset amortization has improved what we thought -- from what we thought in October. And we now estimate only 10 basis points of headwind from 2022 with segment operating margins at 11.1% under our new reporting. We currently expect $2.1 billion of FAS/CAS income in 2023. It's estimated to be roughly $100 million lower in '22, excluding the impact from our pension transfer transaction. Our earnings per share is expected to be between $26.60 and $26.90 for '23 with the year-over-year reduction to adjusted EPS primarily driven by lower segment operating profit in FAS/CAS income, partially offset by the benefit from a lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2023 is greater to or equal than $6.2 billion and assumes continued enactment of the R&amp;D tax capitalization.This increase of $100 million to cash generation, along with our share repurchase guide of another $4 billion, highlights our continued focus on increasing free cash flow per share for our shareholders. This projected combination of higher free cash flow and a lower share count lead to a mid-single-digit growth expectation in free cash flow per share in 2023. Okay. On Chart 20 -- on Chart 12, let's sum it all up. We closed out 2022 with a strong finish with operating momentum and a robust backlog, which have us well positioned to resume growth in 2024 and beyond. We also placed a premium on leveraging our strong cash generation and balance sheet to increase cash returns to our shareholders with a significant increase to share repurchases. Across all four business areas, our breadth of development, production and sustainment programs continue to drive a foundation of growth and sustained high performance.And we will work actively with our customers to meet their increasing demands and mission requirements looking ahead to the future. Our investments for growth, value and efficiency are aligned with our strategy for technology advancement and improved synergies across Lockheed Martin. So in closing, we believe the business is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&amp;A.Operator: And first go the line of David Strauss with Barclays.

Consequently, the segment is likely to contribute to overall revenues when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31.PulteGroup has exhibited a solid performance over the past year, with the stock rising almost at par with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry. It has been benefiting from its focus on entry-level buyers and liquidity protection, prudent management of cash flows and land investment strategy. However, accelerating mortgage rates and continuous supply-chain issues pose a concern.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.A Look at Q4 Segmental PerformancePulteGroup’s Homebuilding segment is expected to have registered growth, courtesy of a higher average selling price or ASP.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $4.52 billion suggests an increase of 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.PulteGroup expects home deliveries to be 8,000, indicating a decline from 8,611 homes delivered a year ago. The decrease reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancelation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on Florida operations. It expects a higher ASP for the quarter in the range of $560,000-$570,000, suggesting an increase from $490,000 in the year-ago period.The consensus mark for ASP is $565,000, which points to a 15.3% year-over-year improvement. For the quarter to be reported, the consensus mark for the number of homes closed is 7,903, which points to an 8.2% year-over-year decrease.A prudent land investment strategy and focus on entry-level buyers are expected to have benefited PulteGroup in the fourth quarter. However, rising mortgage rates might have impacted the demand for homes in the quarter, which is expected to have reflected in the quarterly sales as well as orders for homes.Also, the company has been witnessing supply-chain challenges that are resulting in construction-related delays. The labor market tightened with the limited availability of labor, arresting the rapid growth in housing production. These headwinds might have impacted the upcoming results to some extent.Nonetheless, higher pricing is expected to have mitigated the risks. As such, given these cost price dynamics, PHM expects homebuilding gross margins to expand 120 basis points to 28% for fourth-quarter 2022 from the year-ago period.The company remains on track for full-year SG&amp;A (as a percentage of home sales revenues) to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%.Overall Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.88 per share, indicating 14.7% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.51. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is $4.60 billion, suggesting 5.6% year-over-year growth.PulteGroup, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company, surpassed earnings estimates in 21 of the trailing 24 quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesA Few Recent Construction ReleasesD.R.

224,43c5195a-b84e-39ce-915d-1018c63e42fa,WEC,2023-01-27,WEC Energy Group (WEC) to Report Q4 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-wec-report-150103525.html,1674745263,STORY,['WEC'],"[WEC Energy Group (WEC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electricity and natural gas provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.Revenues are expected to be $2.2 billion, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for WEC Energy?For WEC Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WEC Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that WEC Energy would post earnings of $0.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of +11.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.WEC Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and our financial outlook for 2023. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements related to, among other things, the Company's future financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the Company's Consumer Health business.You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events, using the information available as of today's date, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies.Story continuesThis slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to agenda, Joaquin will open with the comments highlighting his first year as CEO and his priorities for 2023. I will then review the fourth quarter sales and P&amp;L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments as well as full year 2022 results for the enterprise. Joe will then close with additional business commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and our guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 75 minutes. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.Joaquin Duato: Thanks, Jess. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business. I'm excited for the future of Johnson &amp; Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson &amp; Johnson to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This remains as true today as the day we were founded. And I'm honored to continue this legacy. In 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world, as well as the breadth and diversification of our business. There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our Pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline.I'm particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy; and TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. In MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential. Notably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth.This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024. Finally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation. Looking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson &amp; Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent. First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson &amp; Johnson to operate as a two-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech.This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused. In Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve our market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges. Growth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI, and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. In MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022's momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets.This will be a transformational year for Johnson &amp; Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of our new Consumer Health Company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023 as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021. As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&amp;D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&amp;D during 2022. Also, we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase and we deployed over $17 billion in M&amp;A, including the acquisition of Abiomed.Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I'm confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world. Now, let me turn it back to Jess.Jessica Moore: Thanks, Joaquin. Starting with Q4 2022 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 4.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 0.9% as currency had a negative impact of 5.3 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 11.5%. Operational sales outside the U.S. declined 1.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.4 points. Excluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide, 4.7% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedule, acquisitions and divestitures had an immaterial impact on our results in the quarter.Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.77 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.35, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.5%. For the full year 2022, consolidated sales were $94.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to the full year of 2021. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.1%, with currency having a negative impact of 4.8 points.Sales growth in the U.S. was 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales declined 0.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedules, acquisition and divestitures as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year. Net earnings for the full year 2022 were $17.9 billion and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full year 2021.On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2%. While not part of our prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional information and backup for our full year 2022 sales by segment, consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted income before tax by segment, which can be downloaded from our website. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion increased 1%, with an increase of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 5.8% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 6.4% and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 3.2%.Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cough, cold and flu season, and growth in NEUTROGENA as well as strong new product introductions in Asia Pacific and Latin America. NEUTROGENA growth contributed to the second consecutive quarter of 5% operational growth for Skin Health/Beauty. Growth across the portfolio was partially offset by continued, although reduced supply constraints in the U.S. COVID-19 impacts in China, portfolio simplification and the suspension of personal care product sales in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion decreased 7.4% with declines of 0.6% in the U.S. and 14.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales declined 2.5%, and outside the U.S., operational sales declined 4.5%.Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 3.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.4%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6%. Pharmaceutical growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth for the 11th consecutive year, including 7 assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA, and was partially offset by REMICADE and ZYTIGA, due to loss of exclusivity along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth, with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively.ZYTIGA sales declined 43.6% worldwide, predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. IMBRUVICA sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our immunology business, STELARA grew 6.2%, driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 4 points and 5.4 points in the U.S., respectively, as well as a favorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 460 basis points. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the U.S. as well as austerity measures in Europe and shipment timing in Asia Pacific.Photo by 3DVisu on UnsplashTREMFYA grew 12.5%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 1.4 points and 2.9 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. Q4 growth was partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 1,150 basis points, unfavorable patient mix and a challenging prior year comparison. Beginning in Q1 2023, we anticipate that CARVYKTI, currently reported in other oncology, and SPRAVATO, currently reported in other neuroscience, will meet the threshold to be separately disclosed. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion decreased by 1.2%, with growth of 7.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 8.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.9%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.9%.Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 4.4%. Q4 growth was driven by commercial execution, strong new product introduction performance as well as COVID-19 procedure recovery in many parts of the world. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of value-based procurement, COVID resurgence in China as well as supply constraints predominantly envision. Strong growth continued in the U.S., with dollar sales sequentially improving each quarter throughout 2022. OUS performance was adversely impacted by dynamics related to COVID-19, especially given our strong position in China. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 15.1%, driven primarily by strong new product introductions performance, commercial execution and continued market growth in electrophysiology.Abiomed sales are also reported in Interventional Solutions, and financial results were reflected as of December 22nd, the date the acquisition closed. Contact lens global growth of 7.7% reflects strong performance of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and market appropriate price actions. Growth was tempered by continued supply challenges. In the orthopedics franchise, digital and enabling technologies reported in spine, sports and other continued to accelerate and drive pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. For additional context, selling days had approximately a 60 basis points positive impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022.I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related costs, unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business, inflationary pressures as well as unfavorable mix with the enterprise, with a lower portion of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 150 basis points. This represents a 9% reduction versus the prior year, driven by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year as well as proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 16.2% of sales this quarter.The $3.8 billion invested was an 18.6% reduction versus the prior year, driven primarily by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year. Interest income was favorable to prior year by just over $100 million, driven by higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related exit costs, higher Consumer Health separation-related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition and lower gains on securities. As we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit cost and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements.Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by more income in higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year. Additionally, the Company benefited from onetime tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.Now, let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2%, primarily driven by SG&amp;A and R&amp;D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3%, primarily driven by SG&amp;A and R&amp;D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 18.6% to 22%, driven by brand marketing phasing with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson &amp; Johnson fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?Joe Wolk: Thank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19-related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023. We are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long-term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of Talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital supply solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business.Let's delve into the financials, beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged. This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced.Investment in R&amp;D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation. Our second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved. Our third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech's presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships.Finally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we've completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022. I'll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson &amp; Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments. We expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance. We estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%.Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year. Regarding other items on our P&amp;L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&amp;L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson &amp; Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs.On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion for 2023. The majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements, rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to derisk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses.Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling.Some segment remarks, starting with Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower Pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S. While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe.In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery. Specific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we've said, we're excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023. In Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain.Regarding quarterly phasing, it's best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half and likely the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements. In Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA as well as continued pricing pressure. Also, we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year. In MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses.We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half. Given we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health Company. On the P&amp;L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&amp;L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half.Turning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4th with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company. Consistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions. We are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022.These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one, given Johnson &amp; Johnson's market cap. In terms of dissynergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dissynergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end of 2024. As we separate new Johnson &amp; Johnson, we'll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a three-segment company to a two-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&amp;D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K.We also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI, our BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy. The potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus Tagrisso as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Early clinical data from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.Starting Phase 3 clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Potential Phase 2 clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, potential Phase 3 clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug List in China, which will take effect later this year. In MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics, our digital robotic solution, Ottava, our pulsed field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed.Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for new Johnson &amp; Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks.

Revenues declined 4.4% year over year to $23.7 billion and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.72 billion.

(PRNewsFoto/Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company)Planned rationalization and workforce reorganization would result in an approximately 5% reduction in salaried staff globally, or about 500 positions.""Our fourth quarter results fell short of our expectations given a significantly weaker industry backdrop, particularly in Europe,"" said Richard J. Kramer, chairman, chief executive officer and president. ""While our businesses have performed at a high level through the volatility of the past several years, the uncertain near-term macroeconomic outlook and continuing impacts of inflation make these difficult actions necessary to position our business for future success.""Global replacement tire industry demand remained weak in the fourth quarter, led by a 12% decline in EMEA. When coupled with the impacts of inflation — including significant increases in energy costs — the Company expects its EMEA business unit to report a fourth quarter segment operating loss of approximately $80 million. EMEA had reported positive segment operating income since the second quarter of 2020.While raw material and certain other input costs have declined recently, the Company seeks to drive efficiencies to help offset inflation in other areas like wages and benefits.The rationalization and reorganization are expected to be completed during the first and second quarters with a portion in international businesses subject to required consultation with relevant stakeholders. These actions are in addition to cost synergies related to the integration of Cooper Tire.The Company expects to record pre-tax charges associated with these actions of approximately $55 million, primarily relating to cash severance payments that are expected to be substantially paid during the first half of 2023. The rationalization and reorganization will result in a quarterly run-rate benefit of approximately $15 million beginning in the second quarter. Savings in the first quarter are expected to be $5 million.Story continuesThese actions follow the Company's earlier announced plans to close its Melksham, United Kingdom, manufacturing facility and exit its TrenTyre retail operations in South Africa to support EMEA's overall competitiveness.The Company will report fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results after market close on Wednesday, Feb. 8, followed by an investor conference call at 8:30 a.m. EST on Thursday, Feb. 9.Goodyear is one of the world's largest tire companies.

Recently, CNBC published a report noting that “[t]he six largest banks in the U.S. have until the end of July to show the impact that climate change could have on their operations.”Whether you agree or disagree with the science of climate change and the proposed mechanisms to mitigate and reverse it, if the Federal Reserve is weighing in on the matter, we all need to pay attention. Indeed, if you happen to be opposed to the politicization of climate change, this juncture offers an opportunity to practice agnostic emotion-free investing.Basically, the major institutions have made up their mind that climate change is real and that it’s worth addressing. From that perspective, then, it is a real problem (even if it’s not). Therefore, investors will want to key in on the below stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEENextEra Energy$82.67ENPHEnphase Energy$228.44RSGRepublic Services$123.32SHELShell$58.63HDHome Depot$315.48CCJCameco$26.87ORAOrmat Technologies$90.82NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA giant in the new clean and renewable energy infrastructure space, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) should be one of the clear stocks to buy as institutions like the Fed continue to push for climate-friendly initiatives. However, NEE has been slow as of late. For instance, in the trailing year, shares lost 1% of equity value. And in the year so far, it’s down over 2%.Still, contrarians might enjoy a solid opportunity here. As one of the largest American capital investors in clean energy infrastructures, NextEra may enjoy blossoming returns. Again, the political winds move favorably in its direction.Further, the company enjoys some solid financial metrics. Perhaps most notably, it features a strong net margin of 19.3%. As well, its return on equity of 10.4% reflects better-than-average ability of converting equity financing into profits.Story continuesFinally, analysts really dig NextEra, rating it a consensus (and unanimous) strong buy. With their average price target implying a near-19% return, NEE is one of the stocks to buy.Enphase Energy (ENPH)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockPlying its trade in the solar industry, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) specifically specializes in microinverters. Most importantly, in my view, Enphase provides battery storage solutions, enabling homeowners and businesses to effectively harvest their green energy. Better yet, you don’t need to understand the science of what Enphase does to understand that business has been good. In the trailing year, ENPH gained almost 77% of market value.Still, what goes up must come down. Since the January opener, ENPH slipped over 12%. One explanation is that after such a stratospheric rise, investors no longer feel confident about further gains. Conspicuously, even after this year’s early fallout, ENPH features a trailing multiple of above 100. Heck, shares feature a forward multiple of above 47. Both stats rank well above their respective industry medians.Nevertheless, as blackouts become a frequent recurrence for the nation’s stressed energy grid, Enphase enjoys a fundamental upside catalyst. Moreover, the company still attracts a strong buy consensus view among Wall Street analysts. Therefore, it’s one of the stocks to buy.Republic Services (RSG)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRFor a holistic portfolio of stocks to buy geared toward environmental sustainability, you can’t ignore Republic Services (NYSE:RSG). While a waste disposal specialist sounds “dirty,” the reality is that no one pushes for zero environmental impact. Rather, the goal is net zero impact. Based on the laws of physics, waste material can’t just disappear.Beyond its residential waste management business, Republic represents a direct player in climate-friendly stocks to buy with its recycling initiatives. Further, the company offers various environmental solutions for industrial needs, such as remediation, hydrovac and portal sanitation services. Plus, Republic owns the licenses, permits and acumen to handle any type of environmental material safely and properly.Thanks to its countless relevancies, Wall Street analysts rate RSG as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target of $148.36 implies upside potential of more than 20%. Finally, the company offers a small but reliable forward yield of 1.61%.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comBefore the pitchforks come out, let me just explain my inclusion of Shell (NYSE:SHEL) as one of the stocks to buy amid the climate change debate. While the company represents one of the biggest players in the global oil and gas arena, it also recognizes the changing tides. Last year, Shell made headlines when it announced that it will build Europe’s largest renewable hydrogen plant.To be clear, hydrogen attracts criticisms regarding its role toward positively impacting climate change, particularly its cost structure. Still, it’s possible that with an enterprise the size of Shell, it could one day spark favorable economies of scale.Setting the cost debate aside for a moment, what’s really attractive about hydrogen fuel is its “waste” product. Rather than carbon emissions, burning hydrogen yields water.In the meantime, SHEL offers a viable case for stocks to buy. Frankly, the core hydrocarbon business won’t fade out anytime soon. Plus, SHEL enjoys a moderate buy consensus view with an average price target implying 26% upside potential.Home Depot (HD)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukWhile many enterprises sought to offer stocks to buy as an ally of climate justice initiatives, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) cynically and fortuitously stands as a possible beneficiary if climate change worsens. Let me be clear: I’m not suggesting that Home Depot’s operations deliberately and negatively impact the environment. Rather, it will “accidentally” become a beneficiary if the planet’s health deteriorates.Interestingly, several publications noted that Home Depot and its ilk enjoy increased sales prior to significant inclement weather events. Naturally, people need something to batten down the hatches with – and that’s where Home Depot enters the picture. As well, once the storm fades, people need to rebuild what Mother Nature destroyed. Again, you have companies in the home improvement sector ready to serve (and ring up their sales).Plus, Home Depot enjoys solid support from Wall Street analysts. Presently, experts rate HD as a consensus moderate buy. Though their average price target only implies a 9.9% upside potential, the retailer also carries a forward dividend yield of 2.41%. Holistically, then, HD makes a very good case for stocks to buy.Cameco (CCJ)periodic table concept with black cubes. uranium element is glowingSource: ShutterstockUnderstandably, nuclear energy carries a controversial reputation. While things rarely go wrong in this sector, when they do, the consequences can be utterly catastrophic. Therefore, people might hesitate in identifying uranium specialist Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) as one of the stocks to buy for climate-friendly policy. Nevertheless, it’s vital to bring up one point: nuclear energy is clean energy.That’s right, you can’t have an effective clean energy policy without including nuclear. According to the Office of Nuclear Energy, the sector represents a “…zero-emission clean energy source.” Further, data from the Nuclear Energy Institute revealed that the U.S. avoided more than 471 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 thanks to the nuclear industry.What’s more, CCJ has been a top performer in 2022. In the trailing year, shares gained over 30% of equity value. Even better for prospective investors, Wall Street believes CCJ can much higher. Currently, shares enjoy a unanimous view of strong buy. And the average price target implies upside of over 26%.Ormat Technologies (ORA)A geothermal power plant operates with a forest and a clear, bright sky visible behind it.Source: N.Minton / Shutterstock.comFor the final idea for stocks to buy, investors may want to consider Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA). Specializing in renewable geothermal technology, Ormat harnesses the power of the Earth’s core.According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, “[g]eothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist or are human made at varying temperatures and depths below the Earth’s surface. Wells, ranging from a few feet to several miles deep, can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in a variety of applications…”One of the most important attributes of this energy source is that it’s renewable. Per the aforementioned government agency, “[t]he heat flowing from Earth’s interior is continually replenished by the decay of naturally occurring radioactive elements and will remain available for billions of years.”At the present juncture, a main criticism of Ormat is that it’s overvalued against both trailing and forward multiples. However, with nations and institutions pushing for climate-friendly initiatives, Ormat may be one of the long-term stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS). In patients who received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy following surgical resection, KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 27% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.73 [95% CI, 0.60-0.89]) versus placebo regardless of PD-L1 expression. The median DFS in patients regardless of PD-L1 expression who received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy following surgical resection was nearly five years (58.7 months) for the KEYTRUDA arm versus nearly three years (34.9 months) for the placebo arm, translating to a nearly two-year (23.8 months) DFS improvement versus placebo. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of the 167 patients (14%) who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the DFS HR was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.76-2.05).""While there have been many advances for patients with metastatic disease, surgery remains the typical treatment for people with stage IB, II and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, many of these patients who undergo surgery still see their disease return,"" said Roy S. Herbst, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director and chief of medical oncology, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital and ensign professor of medicine (medical oncology) and professor of pharmacology, Yale School of Medicine. ""Today’s approval for KEYTRUDA offers a new, important immunotherapy treatment option for stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA patients with non-small cell lung cancer following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. This provides, for the first time, an adjuvant immunotherapy treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer patients with stage IB disease and regardless of PD-L1 expression.""Story continuesThe adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-091 were generally similar to those occurring in other patients with NSCLC receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, with the exception of hypothyroidism (22%), hyperthyroidism (11%), and pneumonitis (7%). Two fatal adverse reactions of myocarditis occurred.Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune- mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see ""Selected Important Safety Information"" below.""Six years ago, KEYTRUDA was the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and has changed the way metastatic disease is treated. Today’s approval marks the fifth indication for KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer and the first indication for KEYTRUDA in patients with resected stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA disease following adjuvant chemotherapy,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, oncology global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""This is an important milestone as we continue our efforts to pursue meaningful advances for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.""With this approval, KEYTRUDA is the only immunotherapy with an approved option for NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. In addition to today’s approval in the adjuvant setting, KEYTRUDA is indicated in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC; as a single agent for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and is stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic; and as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.Study design and additional data supporting the approvalKEYNOTE-091/EORTC-1416-LCG/ETOP-8-15 – PEARLS (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02504372) is a multicenter, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial conducted in 1,177 patients with completely resected stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition. Patients had not received neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy up to four cycles was optional. Patients were ineligible if they had active autoimmune disease, were on chronic immunosuppressive agents or had a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg or placebo intravenously every three weeks. Treatment continued until RECIST v1.1-defined disease recurrence as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity or up to one year. Tumor assessments were conducted every 12 weeks for the first year, then every six months for years two to three, and then annually through year five. After year five, imaging was performed as per local standard of care. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed DFS. An additional efficacy outcome was overall survival.Of 1,177 patients randomized, 1,010 (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy following resection.In the study, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 11.7 months (range, 1 day to 18.9 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months.The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in DFS in the overall population for patients randomized to the KEYTRUDA arm compared to patients randomized to the placebo arm. Overall survival results were not mature with only 42% of pre-specified OS events in the overall population.KEYNOTE-091/EORTC-1416-LCG/ETOP-8-15 – PEARLS was conducted in collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the European Thoracic Oncology Platform (ETOP).About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible got screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

239,55f81569-015e-359b-85f6-f11a83fcf3f2,MRK,2023-01-27,Merck (MRK) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-mrk-expected-beat-earnings-150103516.html,1674745263,STORY,"['MRK', 'PFE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Merck (MRK) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.3%.Revenues are expected to be $13.72 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Merck?For Merck, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Merck will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Merck would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.85, delivering a surprise of +10.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Merck appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerPfizer (PFE), another stock in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.05 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -2.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $24.2 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Pfizer has been revised 4.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.48%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Pfizer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ILMN) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 12% in the last month. But in truth the last year hasn't been good for the share price. In fact the stock is down 35% in the last year, well below the market return.The recent uptick of 7.5% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Illumina In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year Illumina saw its earnings per share drop below zero. While this may prove temporary, we'd consider it a negative, so it doesn't surprise us that the stock price is down. We hope for shareholders' sake that the company becomes profitable again soon.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Illumina's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.9% in the twelve months, Illumina shareholders did even worse, losing 35%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.6% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. Shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Story continuesPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 20.18%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted Illumina’s fourth-quarter performance. Delays in instruments and consumables purchases, primarily due to the negative foreign exchange impact and consumables inventory deleveraging might also have dented the company’s performance through the fourth quarter.In the last reported quarter, Illumina incurred a huge goodwill impairment charge related to the GRAIL segment, primarily due to the negative impact of current capital market conditions and higher discount rates. This included a stand-alone risk premium on the fair-value calculation of the GRAIL segment, thereby exerting pressure on the bottom line. Going by the recent regulatory updates so far on GRAIL, we expect Illumina to have once again incurred significant legal expenses that might have marred bottom line-growth in the fourth quarter.Customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management and a decline in COVID surveillance revenues are expected to have impeded Illumina’s performance throughout the fourth quarter.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote On a positive note, we expect growth within Core Illumina on the back of growing demand from genetic testing, oncology testing and cancer research customers similar to last reported quarter. The company had a strong customer response to the NovaSeq X Series launch at the Illumina Genomics Forum, where the company reached more than 12,000 viewers in the innovation road map sessions. Customer traction for NovaSeq X exceeded Illumina’s expectation. We believe these developments to have benefited company’s revenue in the fourth quarter.Story continuesIllumina is broadening genomic opportunities across disease states. In October 2022, the company entered into a partnership with General Screen to help countries impacted by tuberculosis to effectively detect and combat multidrug resistant strains. In the same month, Illumina entered into a strategic research collaboration with AstraZeneca to drive drug target discovery by combining their strengths in artificial intelligence (AI)-based genome interpretation and genomic analysis techniques along with industry expertise. We expect these partnerships to have contributed significantly to Illumina’s revenue growth in Q4.In oncology, GRAIL continued to make good progress in Q3, delivering clinical results and signing up a broad range of customers across the health care ecosystem, including health systems and life insurance providers. GRAIL announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Karim Health, the first digital health company, connecting employers and employees to centers of excellence through a value-based care platform. We expect contributions from the GRAIL acquisition to have continued in the to-be reported quarter, adding to top line.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion, suggesting a 12% fall over the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 26 cents indicates an 65.3% slash from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

Now, don’t misinterpret what I’m trying to say: it’s not that you should avoid growth-oriented names altogether. Rather, it’s a prudent idea to pivot your portfolio to a balanced profile. That way, you can accommodate any variability to your market thesis.While no one can say with absolute authority what will happen in 2023, investors should stay on their guard. For one thing, you have a massive geopolitical conflict in Europe that may not be resolved anytime soon. Further, the Federal Reserve still has much work to do to clamp down on excess liquidity. It’s not out of the realm of possibility, then, to see deflationary pressures.Speaking of deflation, eroding economic sentiment contributed to mass layoffs. Having to digest multiple market catalysts, investors should focus on the best dividend stocks to buy for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co$66.86AEPAmerican Electric Power$92.66PSXPhillips 66$106.94WHRWhirlpool$152.12HRBH&amp;R Block$38.50TSNTyson Foods$66.15KHCKraft Heinz$40.26Southern Co (SO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding company, Southern Co (NYSE:SO) commands extraordinary relevance because of its footprint. According to its public profile, Southern is the second largest utility company in the U.S. in terms of customer base, as of 2021. Although it’s a vital component of the economy, SO didn’t get much love these days. In the trailing year, shares slipped a bit under parity.Nevertheless, this circumstance may change for the better because of Southern’s migration-related advantage. Situated in the southern portion of the U.S. (hence its name), it commands a huge coverage map in Georgia. This is significant because Georgia represents one of the states that millennials are moving to. In particular, young folks have streamed into Atlanta.Story continuesAs a passive income provider, Southern offers a very attractive profile. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 4.05%. This ranks a bit higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, Southern features 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, making it an attractive candidate for best dividend stocks to buy.American Electric Power (AEP)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. Like Southern Co above, American Electric benefits from millennial migration trends. Featuring a coverage map that includes much of the Midwest and eastern states, AEP enjoys a clear advantage.With costs of living skyrocketing in major metropolitan areas, young folks have found refuge in relatively more rural areas. For instance, Virginia – where AEP features a strong presence – offers an attractive alternative to pricey regions. Stated differently, American Electric conducts business where the money will be, not necessarily where it is right now.Just as well, the company provides a solid dividend with a forward yield of 3.6%. Also, it features 13 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Admittedly, its payout ratio of 58.78% is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, it’s within a reasonable level as to not spark alarm bells. Finally, Wall Street analysts love AEP, rating it a consensus strong buy. Thus, it makes a great case for best dividend stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the industry’s value chain. This component covers operations like refining and marketing, as opposed to upstream (exploration and production) and midstream (storage and transportation). Fundamentally, as society reaches full normalization, PSX may skyrocket. Indeed, in the trailing year, it’s already up over 29%.But prospective investors shouldn’t be discouraged. As companies start recalling their workers back to the office, traffic volume will surely increase. For instance, Disney (NYSE:DIS) generated headlines recently when CEO Bob Iger basically put an end to remote operations. While some intrepid workers may go independent and join the gig economy, I’m sure most will fall in line.And with that, you’re talking about a high-probability fundamental catalyst. From this angle alone, PSX ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy. Still, as a bonus, the company carries a forward yield of 3.63%. And a relatively low payout ratio of 31% presents little concern about sustainability.Whirlpool (WHR)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockAn oddity among the best dividend stocks to buy, I genuinely believe investors should watch Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) closely this year. Let me be the first to say that appliance manufacturers represent a boring component of the economy. As well, WHR hasn’t exactly been a friend to long-term stakeholders. In the trailing year, shares slipped over 27%. And in the trailing five years, they’re down 19%.So, what gives? As you know, anything mechanical eventually breaks down. Further, the complexities involved in modern appliances and equipment make (in some cases) out-of-warranty repairs financially non-sensical. Plus, if an appliance breaks down, you tend to want a new one.Now, during the first three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the work-from-home pivot likely accelerated home appliance usage (as opposed to in-office appliances). Therefore, the extra, unplanned usage may accelerate the underlying appliances’ breakdown period.Cynically, then, Whirlpool enjoys upside potential. While you’re waiting for this thesis to pan out, the company offers a forward yield of 4.64%. It’s strange but WHR could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that aligns strongly with the gig economy, H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy. At the very least, you should monitor its progress this year. Granted, its core tax consultancy business doesn’t signal a particularly exciting business. However, it’s going to be among the most relevant, depending on how serious workers want to consider the gig economy.Already, we’re seeing reports globally about people quitting rather than going back to the office. In that case (in the U.S.), gig workers must then transition from filing W-2 forms with the IRS and move to the (dreaded) 1099. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to go over all the differences. However, the key point centers on disclosures. With 1099 forms, you must make more of them.Further, because gig workers report their earnings and legal deductions, mistakes may trigger an IRS action. Therefore, it’s vital that these independent contractors know what they’re doing. H&amp;R Block can help. Plus, the company offers a forward yield of 3.10%.Tyson Foods (TSN)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) represents a vital category in the economy, it hasn’t had a great performance in 2022. Indeed, in the trailing year, TSN gave up nearly 29% of equity value. It’s not just related to technical rumblings. Fundamentally, investors lost confidence in Tyson because of growing margin pressure and operational issues.From this basis, Tyson represents one of the riskier names among the best dividend stocks to buy. At the same time, it’s difficult to be overly negative on food-related enterprises. Unlike companies in the consumer discretionary space, no trade down (cheaper alternative) exists for food. You’re either eating or you’re not.Financially, the troubles did make TSN more attractive. Currently, the company sports a decently stable balance sheet and solid profitability. Better yet, the market prices TSN at 9.65-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 16 times.Finally, Tyson carries a forward yield of just under 3%. Also, it features 11 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Thus, it’s a solid contrarian candidate for best dividend stocks to buy.Kraft Heinz (KHC)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) presents an intriguing narrative for the best dividend stocks to buy. Primarily, it features a generous rate of passive income. At the same time, KHC has been a proven winner. You’re probably not going to get rich off the shares. However, I’ll take a trailing-year performance of 9.6% any time, particularly when the benchmark equities index slipped sharply.Fundamentally, investors should pay close attention to KHC because of the trade-down effect. Assuming economic conditions worsen from here, consumers will start cutting unnecessary expenses and seeking cheaper alternatives to desired products/services. However, you can’t trade down from making your own food at home. Therefore, Kraft Heinz’s core grocery products-related business should blossom.While investors wait for this plotline to pan out, they can collect some sweet passive income. Currently, Kraft Heinz carries a forward yield of 4%. And while its payout ratio at 55.24% is somewhat elevated, it’s arguably not going to cause serious concern. Thus, KHC ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 3rd of March to $0.56. This takes the dividend yield to 1.8%, which shareholders will be pleased with. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 5.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.72 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.24. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. TE Connectivity has impressed us by growing EPS at 20% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.TE Connectivity Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that TE Connectivity is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for TE Connectivity that you should be aware of before investing. Is TE Connectivity not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

But several members of the expert advisory group asked for more robust data on benefits of annual shots for younger, healthier people.""We're in a very different place. We have a lot of population immunity,"" said Hayley Gans, professor of pediatrics at Stanford University Medical Center. ""Now that people are immune, how long does that last?""Vaccine makers Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc introduced late last year updated versions of their COVID vaccines tailored to target Omicron variants as well as the original coronavirus. In the United States, those were used only as booster shots.The FDA advisory group unanimously backed using those shots for the primary series for those who have yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as well.The FDA said it envisioned holding a meeting later in the year to determine the composition of shots for the fall, although some vaccine makers might be able to produce updated shots more quickly.Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were able to produce the currently available messenger RNA boosters in about three months last year, but Novavax Inc said on Thursday it would require six months to make a new version of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine designed to match circulating coronavirus variants.FDA would consider an earlier timeline for vaccines like Novavax's following the company's manufacturing assessment, Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research, said.Health officials in the Biden administration have suggested that annual, updated COVID-19 booster shots could provide a high level of protection against severe disease.

They said at the time it was very unlikely to represent a true clinical risk.Dr. Nicola Klein of healthcare company Kaiser Permanente, which maintains VSD data for the CDC, said the rate of strokes observed in the database had slowed in recent weeks, but the signal was still statistically significant, meaning likely not by chance.Most of the confirmed cases had also received a flu vaccine at the same time, which might be a factor, she said.FDA scientist Richard Forshee said the agency plans to study whether there is any increased risk of stroke from receiving the two shots at the same time.Both agencies still recommend older adults receive the booster shots, now tailored to target Omicron variants as well as the original coronavirus.Dr. Walid Gellad, professor of medicine at University of Pittsburgh, said the issue required further investigation.""Sometimes signals are not clear,"" Gellad said in an email. ""It makes sense to look into it more, and it doesn't make sense to change practice given the known benefits (of getting the booster) in this age group.""

In the last reported quarter, Novo Nordisk delivered an earnings beat of 2.38%.Shares of Novo Nordisk have gained 46.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s increase of 12.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported. What Our Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Novo Nordisk this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for NVO is +11.25% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at 80 cents per share and the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at 89 cents per share.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Factors at PlayNovo Nordisk operates under two segments — Diabetes and Obesity Care, and Biopharmaceuticals.Novo Nordisk’s revenues in the last reported quarter increased 15% at constant exchange rates, driven by higher sales of Diabetes and Obesity Care products, a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter as well.The Diabetes and Obesity Care segment’s sales grew 17% year over year in the last reported quarter, a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter as well.Obesity Care (Saxenda and Wegovy) sales were up significantly year over year in the last reported quarter, a trend that most likely continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Sales in the Rare disease segment grew 4% year over year in the last reported quarter, a trend that most likely continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHigher costs driven by clinical activity for late-stage studies are likely to have escalated research and development costs in the third quarter.Sales and distribution costs also increased year over year in the last reported quarter. This increase was due to International Operations and North America Operations reflecting promotional activities related to Ozempic and Rybelsus as well as Obesity care market development activities. The trend has most likely prevailed in the to-be-reported quarter.Concurrent with the third quarter results, management stated that intensifying competition within both Diabetes care and Rare disease as well as a negative impact on global sales growth from Volume Based Procurement of insulin in China will impact the annual performance.Persistent pricing pressure within Diabetes Care, especially in the United States, is likely to have negatively impacted sales in the fourth quarter. Novo Nordisk AS Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Novo Nordisk AS Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNovo Nordisk AS price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Novo Nordisk AS Quote Other Stocks to ConsiderSanofi SNY has an Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank #2.

278,55f81569-015e-359b-85f6-f11a83fcf3f2,PFE,2023-01-27,Merck (MRK) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-mrk-expected-beat-earnings-150103516.html,1674745263,STORY,"['MRK', 'PFE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Merck (MRK) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.3%.Revenues are expected to be $13.72 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Merck?For Merck, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Merck will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Merck would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.85, delivering a surprise of +10.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Merck appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerPfizer (PFE), another stock in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.05 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -2.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $24.2 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Pfizer has been revised 4.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.48%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Pfizer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. NovoCure (NVCR) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.29 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 23, 2023.NovoCure's Earnings ESP sits at 9.47%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.29 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.32.NVCR is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Pfizer (PFE).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 31, 2023. PFE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.06 a share five days from its next earnings release.For Pfizer, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 is 0.48%.Story continuesNVCR and PFE's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In the last reported quarter, the company beat earnings expectations by 21.09%.The drug giant’s performance has been mixed with the company exceeding earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one. The company delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.58% on average.Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        Pfizer Inc. price-eps-surprise | Pfizer Inc. QuotePfizer’s stock has declined 14.2% in the past year against an increase of 13.8% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to NoteDirect sales and alliance revenues from partner BioNTech BNTX for the COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty and Pfizer’s oral antiviral pill for COVID, Paxlovid are expected to have been key contributors to Pfizer’s sales in the fourth quarter.As far as Comirnaty is concerned, third-quarter outside U.S. sales were hurt by a shift in scheduled deliveries to the fourth quarter as well as slower demand in emerging markets. While slower demand in emerging markets is likely to have continued, the benefit from the shift in deliveries is likely to have aided sales. In the United States, deliveries of the newly authorized Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent booster, including for under five years of age (approval in December), is likely to have boosted sales of Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty.Our estimate for direct sales and alliance revenues from Comirnaty is $7.57 billion, while that for Paxlovid is $4.96 billion.Excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, higher alliance revenues from Pfizer’s key brand, Eliquis, higher sales of Prevnar family of vaccines and drugs like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax are likely to have contributed to sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eliquis alliance revenue is $1.55 billion, Prevnar family of vaccines is $1.47 million and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax is $633 million.Story continuesHowever, sales of key medicine, Ibrance in the United States are likely to have declined due to increased competitive pressure and an increase in the proportion of patients using Pfizer’s Patient Assistance Program (which provides Ibrance free of charge to certain low-income patients). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ibrance is $1.29 billion, while our estimate is $1.26 billion.Sales of some key drugs like Xeljanz, Sutent and Enbrel in international markets are likely to have declined in the fourth quarter, continuing the trend of the past few quarters. While Sutent sales are expected to have been hurt due to the loss of exclusivity, sales of Enbrel in key European markets and Japan are likely to have been hurt due to biosimilar competition. Lower prescription volumes globally as doctors’ prescribing patterns shift away from JAK inhibitors following label warnings are likely to have hurt Xeljanz’s sales in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xeljanz and Enbrel is pegged at $524 million and $226 million, respectively while our estimate is $475.5 million and $245.9 million, respectively.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Pfizer in the to-be-reported quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise. This is the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: Pfizer’s Earnings ESP is +0.48% as the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.06 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05.

The server and storage solutions provider posted stellar growth during its FY22 and it recently upped its guidance for Q2 FY23 which it is set to report on January 31.Super Micro Computer has showcased impressive top and bottom-line expansion during the tech downturn. SMCI's ability to up its guidance as most major firms in technology and beyond lower their guidance amid a slowing economy is also great to see.Despite the huge run, investors might want to consider buying Super Micro Computer for even more upside in 2023 and beyond.The SMCI BasicsSuper Micro Computer makes application-optimized server and storage solutions for enterprise-level cloud computing, artificial intelligence, telecom, and beyond. The firm has expanded its customer base even as it competes against the likes of IBM IBM and others in the server segment by rolling out ad-hock solutions. Super Micro Computer enables customers to fine-tune and customized their server and storage solutions. Super Micro Computer’s impressive history dates back to its founding in Silicon Valley in the early 1990s.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSMCI’s FY22 revenue (period ended in June) soared 46% to boost its adjusted earnings by nearly 130%. The firm posted a strong first quarter of its fiscal 2023 and it upped its Q2 FY23 revenue and earnings guidance on January 18. The firm cited its expanding markets and diversified customer base “adopting” its “rack-scale Total IT Solutions” as a reason for its increasingly bullish outlook.SMCI’s improving earnings outlook for Q2, as well as for FY23 and FY24 helps it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb another 31% in FY23 to $6.8 billion to boost its adjusted earnings by 73%. The nearby chart helps put Super Micro Computer’s recent growth into its strong historical context.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesSMCI has consistently topped our EPS estimates and its Computer- Storage Devices segment is in the top 30% of over 250 Zacks industries. As we mentioned up top, Super Micro Computer stock is up nearly 100% in the past 12 months to help it blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 18% drop.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $5.54 per share on revenues of $32 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil refiner and marketer’s results in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MPC’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last-reported quarter, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator handily beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment, whose operating income totaled $4.6 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.2%.MPC had reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.80. Revenues of $47.2 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.4%.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 60.1%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has been revised 3.5% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 326.2% jump year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a 10.1% decrease from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderMPC is expected to have benefited from the strength in refining margins. In the third quarter of 2022, the company’s refining margin of $30.21 per barrel rocketed from $14.51 a year ago. Moreover, throughput rose from 2,836 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) in the third quarter of 2021 to 3,007 mbpd.Despite softening from the spectacular highs of the June quarter, the overall positive momentum is most likely to have continued in the fourth quarter, thanks to the strength in fuel demand on the back of rebounding road and airline travel, which pushed up crude differentials and margins.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marathon Petroleum’s Refining &amp; Marketing segment operating income is pegged at $2.8 billion, increasing exponentially from the prior-year quarter’s profit of just $881 million. This is likely to have buoyed the fourth-quarter results of Marathon Petroleum.Story continuesWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Marathon Petroleum this season.

GM has shelved for now plans to build a fourth EV battery plant in North America.Ford is in talks with German unions to cut thousands of jobs in its European operations and possibly sell a German vehicle assembly plant. In October, it stopped funding autonomous vehicle affiliate Argo AI.GM and Ford both rely on sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the United States for the bulk of their global profits. This year, both automakers plan to ramp up sales of much less profitable electric vehicles in North America and other markets.The risk to the Detroit automakers' profitability would be a challenge in the best of times. But now, GM and Ford must factor in forecasts for a slowdown, or even a recession, in the U.S. economy.EV battery raw material costs are rising, but U.S. EV market leader Tesla is cutting prices on its best-selling Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by as much as 20%.The Model Y SUV competes with Ford's Mustang Mach-E, GM's Cadillac Lyriq EV, and with combustion SUVs the Detroit automakers sell.Morgan Stanley estimated increased prices added an average of $3 billion a year to Ford's pre-tax bottom line and was the equivalent of more than 200% of the improvement in the company's pre-tax profits for 2022.GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker by sales in 2022, said higher prices added $2.1 billion to pre-tax profits in the third quarter compared to the same quarter in 2021 - equivalent to nearly half of pre-tax profits for the period overall.Story continuesThe company has told investors it will spend $35 billion on electric and automated vehicles between 2020 and 2025.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +11.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has gained 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.63 per share, indicating a change of +20.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. This estimate has changed -7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.60 indicates a change of -21.1% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.2%. The $155.49 billion and $160.31 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.4% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $41.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.4%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.83 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +19.05%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Results were impacted by the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic and cost inflation, among other factors.However, the company is on track to capitalize on a sustained shift to cooking more at home, higher digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating and trusted brands.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of 73 cents per share declined from 84 cents in the year-ago quarter. The metric also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share.McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated QuoteThis global leader in flavor generated sales of $1,695.7 million, down 2% year over year. Constant-currency (cc) sales increased 2% on 9% growth from pricing actions, somewhat offset by a 3% decline in volumes.The volume decline stemmed from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic, the exit of a low-margin business across India and the Consumer business in Russia and a 4% decline from all other volumes and product mix. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,760 million.During the quarter, cc sales increased at a three-year CAGR of 5%, relative to the pre-pandemic baseline of 2019. MKC’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 410 basis points due to escalated cost inflation, higher other supply-chain expenses and an adverse product mix. These were somewhat countered by cost savings from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program and pricing actions.The operating income was $264 million, down from the $276 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by gross margin contraction, mainly in the Flavor Solutions unit. The adjusted operating income fell from $309 million to $278 million.Story continuesSegment DetailsConsumer: Sales went down 8% to $1,037.8 million, and cc sales fell 4% due to soft volumes and mix. These were somewhat compensated by pricing actions across all three regions.The volume decline included the adverse impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic, and the exit of a low-margin business across India and the Consumer business in Russia. Sales dropped 4% in the Americas, 13% in the EMEA and 29% in Asia/Pacific.Flavor Solutions: Sales in the segment advanced 9% to $657.9 million. On a cc basis, sales grew 14% due to solid pricing actions, improved volumes and a product mix.Flavor Solutions sales in the Americas grew 13%. Flavor Solutions sales in the EMEA fell by 2%. Sales in the Asia/Pacific market remained flat year over year.Financial UpdateMcCormick exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $334 million, long-term debt of $3,642.3 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,680.5 million. For the 12 months ended Nov 30, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $651.5 million.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceMcCormick anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the Global Operating Effectiveness Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have a positive effect on the fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management anticipates currency movements to have a minimal impact on fiscal 2023 net sales, operating income and earnings per share (EPS).For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, is likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to grow 9-11%. Management envisions adjusted EPS in the band of $2.63-$2.68 in fiscal 2023.The company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $2.56-$2.61 per share in fiscal 2023, suggesting 1-3% growth. The bottom line is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has tumbled 8.6% in the past six months compared to the industry’s 3% increase.Solid Consumer Staple PicksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are e.l.f.

And it was a miss on both efforts there.- This is not the first challenging quarter for McCormick. This might be the third or fourth one in a row. And I can't blame myself for it. Because I'm an aggressive buyer of Frank's RedHot sauce. I really do put that shit on every-- or S-H-T--[LAUGHTER]--on everything, as the commercials say, as the marketing says. But look, here's another company still dealing with a significant amount of inflation, trying to push through price increases. But consumers pushing back. And then also, a lot consumers still going out to eat in restaurants. And, of course, you're not-- if you're going out to eat at an Olive Garden or et cetera, you're not at home cooking food. And, of course, being at home during the pandemic really helped the likes of McCormick.- Yeah, the gross profit margins here is not looking great either, 36.8%. So that is down several basis points versus a year earlier and below estimates. The company also blaming part of this on COVID-related disruptions in China. So that that was a problem for them, too. I don't know. I was just thinking about this. I put Yellowbird Sriracha on a lot of stuff--- What's that?- --or chili crisp, the like--- Yes.- Laoganma, whatever.- Yes.- So I have to look at who makes those. I'm not a Frank's RedHot kind of girl.- I'm not. Yeah, I don't really do the Franks RedHot. I'm sorry.- OK. All right. Fair enough, guys.- We actually get our seasoning and some sauces shipped in from Texas. Yeah.- Oh, well, pardon me.- [LAUGHS]- Yeah, this is a custom spice guy over here.Story continues- And also technical analysis.- Look, I almost had you buy some spices for me from Pike Place.- That's true.- That's true.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.84 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -15.12%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this spices and seasonings company would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of 6.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.McCormick , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $1.7 billion for the quarter ended November 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.63%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.73 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.McCormick shares have lost about 5.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for McCormick?While McCormick has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for McCormick: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.59 on $1.53 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.92 on $6.65 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Airlines Holdings is:11% = US$737m ÷ US$6.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.Does United Airlines Holdings Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that United Airlines Holdings has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Airlines industry average (10%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining United Airlines Holdings' Debt And Its 11% Return On EquityIt appears that United Airlines Holdings makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 4.52. The combination of a rather low ROE and high debt to equity is a negative, in our book.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course United Airlines Holdings may not be the best stock to buy.

Due to its value-creating initiatives, defensive product mix and real estate growth strategy, the company has the capability to gain market share. Moreover, its commitment to better pricing, private label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiative should drive sales.Dollar General expects net sales growth of about 11% — including an estimated benefit of approximately two percentage points from the 53rd week — for fiscal 2022. The company now foresees same-store sales growth toward the upper end of its earlier projected range of 4-4.5% for the fiscal year of 2022. Let’s delve deep.Striking the Right Chord With CustomersDollar General’s initiatives such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and the private fleet should benefit the top line. The company has been sparing no effort to bolster omnichannel operations and ramp up delivery services to provide customers with a frictionless shopping experience. Its partnership with DoorDash continues to yield results, with same-day delivery now available at more than 13,000 stores at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022.Talking about the company’s transformational initiatives, DG Fresh is designed to enable the self-distribution of fresh and frozen products. Meanwhile, Fast Track aims at increasing labor productivity in stores, enhancing customer convenience and improving on-shelf availability.Under DG Fresh, the company has been expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items. In the third quarter, the company installed more than 17,000 cooler doors across its store base. The company completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain and is now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities.With respect to Fast Track, the company has been expanding its self-checkout facility, which was available in more than 10,500 stores at the end of the third quarter.pOpshelf Store - Another CatalystDollar General, through its pOpshelf stores, targets affluent customers looking for better bargains. In the third quarter, the company opened 23 new pOpshelf locations, which took the total count to 103.Additionally, at the end of the quarter, the company had a total of 40 store-within-a-store concepts, a smaller pOpshelf store in Dollar General’s larger-format stores. Management reaffirmed its plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count, which would result in about 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations by the end of fiscal 2022.Further, the company plans to nearly double the pOpshelf store count next year. The company’s real estate plans for fiscal 2023 include opening approximately 150 additional locations. These will bring the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 300 by the end of fiscal 2023.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this retailer have returned +12.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share, indicating a change of -56.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.53 points to a change of -59.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.48 indicates a change of +71.3% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $108.41 billion and $111.46 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +2.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While AI has been a well-known buzzword for years, the rollout of ChatGPT has catapulted it to the mainstream. ChatGPT (stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is an AI-powered chatbot that was launched in November 2022 by OpenAI – a company co-founded by some of Silicon Valley's most prominent names such as Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder), Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.Though ChatGPT is still merely a prototype, users are flocking to the tool due to its surprisingly deep knowledge across many areas and its in-depth responses to queries. Just how powerful is ChatGPT? The bot has passed the medical license, MBA operations, and bar exams – and it will only improve from here.Today we will cover 5 companies at the forefront of the AI revolution:Microsoft: In 2019, Microsoft backed ChatGPT creator OpenAI with $1 billion in funding. After the hugely successful launch of the ChatGPT prototype, Microsoft announced earlier this week that the software giant would invest another $10 billion over the next ten years.Meanwhile, ChatGPT is converting from a free service to a ""freemium"" service. The tool is available for free to all. However, premium users can enjoy more rapid response speeds and availability when the bot's demand is high for $42 per month.Microsoft's Azure is the primary cloud service provider for ChatGPT. Last night during MSFT's EPS call CEO Satya Nadella confirmed the company's commitment to AI by saying, ""We are committed to help customers use our platforms and tools to do more with less today and innovate for the future in the new era of AI."" Shares rose 5% initially.Story continuesNvidia: Though AI has been in use for years, it has only recently exploded in popularity because the masses are using it. What was holding AI back before? AI platforms such as ChatGPT require immense computing power to process intricate computing tasks. Nvidia is the leader in PC graphic processors, and its technologies are already being used in several AI realms, such as high-performance computing and virtual reality platforms. Nvidia competitorsalso stand to benefit.Alphabet: Google parent Alphabet is currently the biggest user of AI in its many businesses. Alphabet utilizes AI to:·      Optimize its search engine Google.·      Moderate content that violates policies on its YouTube video platform.·      Spearhead its autonomous driving division Waymo.·      Turn image data into actionable insights in its robotics company Boston Dynamics.The best option for investors looking for a pure play on AI and autonomous driving would be Mobileye. Mobileye is a leader in the autonomous driving space and supplies its technologies to a wide array of automakers. Mobileye and Tesla should continue to lead in this space as demand grows due to the drastic increase in distracted driving deaths. Several months ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted that Tesla would soon look to manufacture a futuristic ""Robotaxi,"" which will be arideshare service that can operate without a human driver.Intuitive Surgical: Like driving, there are many realms that AI proponents believe will be better handled by machine rather than man. One such area is minimally invasive surgery – a medical practice where precision is paramount. Intuitive Surgical is best known for its successful ""da Vinci"" robotic surgical system which costs $2 million. Currently, surgeons control the device from a console away from the patient and can complete a variety of complex procedures. However, the company is using AI to collect and curate data to lead to better patient outcomes in the future.ConclusionIn the long run, stocks are driven by higher earnings, and higher earnings are driven by innovation. Think back to some of the biggest winning stocks over the past few decades.For this reason, investors need to begin tracking the AI space. Though the space is in its infancy and the use cases have only scratched the surface, investors should expect an influx of investment dollars following the recent success of ChatGPT and more game-changing technology to be unveiled in the coming years. While few public pure plays exist now, in the future, investors should expect new companies to come public and existing companies to derive more and more revenue from this groundbreaking industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Welcome to the Navient Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host for today, Jennifer Earyes, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jennifer Earyes: Hello, good morning, and welcome to Navient's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2022. With me today are Jack Remondi, Navient's CEO; and Joe Fisher, Navient's CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, forward-looking statements and other information about our business that is based on management's current expectations as of the date of this presentation. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. So listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the Company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including core earnings, adjustable tangible equity ratio and various other non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from core earnings. We will also refer to adjusted core earnings which are measurements derived from core earnings and adjusted to exclude one-time expenses related to regulatory and restructuring costs. Our GAAP results and description of our non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the fourth quarter 2022 supplement earnings disclosure, which is posted on the Investors page at navient.com. You will find more information about these measures beginning on Page 18 of Navient's fourth quarter earnings release. There is also a full reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP results included in the disclosure.Story continuesThank you. And now I will turn the call over to Jack.Jack Remondi: Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Navient. We completed 2022 with another quarter of strong financial performance. We delivered adjusted core earnings of $0.85 for the quarter and $3.43 for the year and a core return on equity of 17%. These results demonstrate our ability to deliver solid financial performance even in disruptive economic environments. The business environment ended 2022 very differently than it started. For example, inflation pressured operating expenses, rising rates and the CARES Act extensions virtually eliminated current demand for student loan refinancing and rule changes impacting the management of defaulted federal loans ended our portfolio management business earlier than anticipated.A strength of our franchise is our ability to adjust to both expected and unexpected events to deliver for our customers and investors. For example, in-school originations grew 52% this year, with our growth outlook increasing. We are leveraging our client relationships to win new business processing contracts. We successfully reduced operating expense in a high inflationary environment, and our hedging strategies and efficient funding programs mitigated the impact of rising rates to our net interest margins. Your management team is focused on delivering exceptional results by executing our strategy, delivering on our growth potential, maximizing our loan portfolio cash flows, continuously improving our operating efficiency and prudent and consistent capital management.In Consumer Lending, we are focused on growing originations of high-quality loans with attractive risk-adjusted returns. In 2022, rising rates and zero interest federal loans reduced our opportunities in refi to $1.7 billion in new originations. We rapidly adapted to these conditions to slash marketing spend and focus on our in-school products. Here, we grew new loan volume by 52% over last year to $321 million, an estimated 10x market growth. We also continued to build relationships with students planning to go to college, adding over 700,000 new students to our Going Merry platform. Here, we help students and families complete the FAFSA, compare financial aid award packages from schools and apply for scholarships. We see these products as important ways of helping students and families throughout their going to and paying-for-college journey.In our Business Processing Solutions segment, we grew non-pandemic-related revenue by $25 million or 11%. It's also worth noting that our pandemic-related contracts extended longer than the original award, and we have been able to leverage this to win several new contracts in 2022, both strong statements on the value we provided to our clients. Our large and profitable portfolio of student loans is a key contributor to earnings. Our goal has and continues to be to maximize the performance of this portfolio. This includes helping borrowers navigate repayment options and avoid default and innovative funding and hedging strategies to maximize net interest income. Our funding and hedging strategies helped deliver a stable net interest margin, despite the rapid rise in rates this year.Since our founding in 2014, we have clearly excelled at maximizing the value of our portfolio, and we will continue to do so. We are also continuously improving our operating efficiency. In 2022, operating expense declined by 21% or $205 million. We delivered improved efficiency in our operating segments, and we continue to take action that reduced our risk profile. In the final area, we seek to be excellent stewards of your capital. Our goals are to be efficient and prudent while delivering attractive returns. Here, our priorities remain unchanged, invest capital and attractive and relevant growth opportunities, support our dividend and return excess capital to you via share repurchases. This consistent and transparent approach supports our business growth, our debt investors, our corporate ratings and enabled the return of $491 million via dividends and share repurchases last year.Our financial and business success last year positions us for another year of strong performance. For 2023, we are focused on the same four objectives: profitably growing our loan origination and BPS revenue; maximizing the performance of our loan portfolios; improving operating efficiency; and prudent and consistent capital management. In Consumer Lending, we expect to double in-school loan originations, building on the progress we made in 2022. We expect that demand for refi loans will continue to be suppressed, but we are prepared to move quickly when market conditions change. We will also continue to grow and build long-term relationships with students and families as we support their going to college journey. In BPS, we are well positioned to deliver 10% growth in revenue from our traditional clients.With this growth, we also expect to earn a high-teen EBITDA margin, and new contract wins in late 2022 and expansions of existing contracts have created a clear path to these goals. As a result of our ongoing focus on operating efficiency, we will reduce operating expense by an additional 10% in 2023. And in capital management, our plan is to complete approximately $310 million in share repurchases. Our results this quarter capped a strong year for Navient. They reflect our commitment and ability to generate high-quality, high-value products and services and deliver solid financial results even in volatile and changing markets. They also reflect our ongoing commitment to simplify our business model and reduce our risk profile. More importantly, our efforts have built a solid foundation from which to create and deliver value.Our guidance for 2023 reflects our confidence in our ongoing ability to grow new business, maximize portfolio performance, deliver better margins through operating efficiency and deliver attractive returns on capital. I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts and commitment to success. And together, we look forward to delivering another great year of results in 2023. Joe will now provide a more detailed review of our results. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions later in the call. Joe?Joe Fisher: Thank you, Jack, and thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the fourth quarter and full-year results for 2022 and provide our outlook for 2023. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which can be found on the company's website in the Investors section. In 2022, we successfully met or exceeded our original full-year guidance targets. Key highlights from the quarter and year, beginning on Slide 3, includes fourth quarter adjusted core EPS of $0.85 and full-year EPS of $3.43. We achieved an ROE of 17% and an overall efficiency ratio of 52% for the year in the face of a challenging inflationary environment. FFELP NIM of 94 basis points and full-year NIM of 101 basis points, private NIM of 287 basis points and full-year NIM of 281 basis points.Grew in-school originations by 52% to $322 million for the full-year and achieved total originations of $2 billion. Reported BPS revenues of $70 million in the quarter and $330 million for the year while achieving full-year EBITDA margins of 16%, increased our adjusted tangible equity ratio to 7.7% while returning $491 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. I'll provide additional detail on the quarter and our 2023 full-year outlook by segment, beginning with Federal Education Loans on Slide 5. In the Federal Education Loan segment, we achieved a net interest margin of 101 basis points for the full-year, exceeding our original mid-90s guidance in a volatile interest rate environment. The quarter's results continue to be impacted by an incremental level of consolidation activity from previously announced loan forgiveness proposals.The incremental prepayments that were processed during the fourth quarter represented 3% of our portfolio. This activity reduced FFELP net interest margin by 11 basis points to 94 basis points. There has since been a significant decline in consolidation request to historical levels. Our expectation for full-year 2023 FFELP NIM of 100 basis points to 110 basis points assumes that prepayment speeds remain at historical levels in 2023. FFELP delinquency rates decreased to 15.6% from 18.6% in the third quarter, and charge-offs declined by $1 million, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 13 basis points in the quarter. We anticipate a net charge-off rate between 10 basis points and 20 basis points for the full-year 2023. Let's turn to our Consumer Lending segment on Slide 6.Net interest income in the quarter was $147 million and resulted in a net interest margin of 287 basis points, an improvement of 11 basis points compared to the prior year. We are seeing a slowdown in prepayment speeds in the overall portfolio as borrowers with fixed interest rates have less of an incentive to refinance in the current environment, which is benefiting net interest income. We anticipate our full-year net interest margin for 2023 to be between 280 basis points and 290 basis points. Our credit trends continue to perform as expected as net charge-offs ended on the low end of our original guidance of 1.5% to 2% with 156 basis points for the quarter and 159 basis points for the full-year of 2022. The $17 million of provisions in the quarter included $3 million related to new originations.We feel confident that we are adequately reserved for the expected life of loan losses given the well-seasoned and high credit quality of our portfolio and anticipate net charge-offs to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range for 2023. In the quarter, we originated $169 million of private education loans. This was comprised of $35 million of new in-school volume, representing a 52% increase compared to the prior year. The expected decline in refinance loan origination volume to $134 million was primarily driven by the higher rate environment and delay in Department of Education loans entering repayment. We expect that the higher rate environment continues throughout 2023, and the extension of the CARES Act will result in lower quarterly originations for our refi product.Let's continue to Slide 7 to review our Business Processing segment. Revenue from our traditional BPS services increased 27% from the year ago quarter, partially offsetting the expected wind down of revenue from pandemic-related services. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $70 million and earned an 11% EBITDA margin. The 11% margin was below our targeted levels due to wind down costs associated with pandemic-related services in the quarter. We anticipate the benefit of recent efficiency initiatives to increase the margin in this segment as we progress throughout the year. We expect to see continued fee revenue growth of 10% in our traditional services in 2023 with full-year EBITDA margins in the high teens. Turning to our financing and capital allocation activity that is highlighted on Slide 8.During the year, we reduced our share count by 15% due to repurchase of 24.8 million shares. In total, we returned $491 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while increasing our adjusted tangible equity ratio to 7.7% from 5.9% a year ago. Our 2023 guidance includes the repurchase of $310 million of shares while building our adjusted tangible equity ratio to a range of 8% to 9%. Turning to GAAP results on Slide 9. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $105 million or $0.78 per share compared with a net loss of $11 million or a loss of $0.07 per share in 2021 for the same period. In closing and turning to our outlook for 2023 on Slide 10, the success of 2022 and steps we have taken to simplify the business, improve efficiency while building capital positions us well for 2023.As a result, we expect our 2023 adjusted core earnings per share to be $3.15 and $3.30, reflecting our continued efforts to improve efficiency. Our outlook excludes regulatory and restructuring costs, assumes no gains or losses from future loan sales or debt repurchases, reflects a continued rising interest rate environment and no meaningful impact from an expiration of the CARES Act in 2023. Thank you for your time, and I will now open the call for questions.See also 15 Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the World and 13 Biggest Eyewear Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The uptick was owing to lower revenue reserves, and higher demurrage and affiliate revenue.Story continuesLiquidity, Dividends and BuybackCSX exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,958 million compared with $2,239 million at the end of 2021. Long-term debt totaled $17,896 million compared with $16,185 million at 2021-end.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.06 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Visa shares have added about 8.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Visa?While Visa has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

We have Intel, KLA, Visa, Hasbro, and Salesforce. Kicking it off with Intel, that stock off just about 8% here after-hours. A weak report here from the company, missing on both the top and bottom lines, their guidance coming in a bit light. We certainly are seeing that reflected in the after-hours move here.The CFO of Intel saying that they did take steps to rightsize the business in Q4. We know there are cost cutting efforts. They're looking to cut $3 billion in costs this year, up to $10 billion in 2025. Over the last three months, the stock has gotten a bit of a boost here, up just about 10 and 1/2%, nearly giving all of that back, though, in extended trading.Taking a look at KLA, that stock also under a bit of pressure, off just about 5% right now. The company's sinking as the outlook disappointed. This, of course, follows that drop in the chip demand. So Intel, KLA, those reports disappointing. We're seeing that also reflected in some of those competitors out there. Nvidia stock under pressure, Qualcomm stock under pressure here after-hours. So a couple of names to keep in mind ahead of tomorrow's opening bell.Taking a look at Hasbro, that stock off just about 9% of huge headlines here. They announced their preliminary results, cutting 1,000 jobs, 15% of their workforce. President and COO here, Eric Neiman, will also be leaving the company. The prelim Q4 revenue number missed, EPS coming in a bit light. Holiday sales, quote, ""underperformed."" Certainly, we're seeing that reflected in that 9% drop.Taking a look at Visa, that stock up just about 1 and 1/2% here. The company beating on both the top and the bottom lines. Payment volume up 7%. Visa also saying that effective February 1st, Ryan McInerney will be taking over as CEO. Again, we're looking at gains here after-hours.Rounding it out with Salesforce, that stock under a bit of pressure after popping here in intraday trading, but off just about a half of a percent. A Wall Street Journal report now out saying that Elliott is preparing to nominate directors at Salesforce. It didn't name any specific names, but clearly a battle is heating up for some of those board seats.Now the Journal reports followed the Bloomberg report that we got out earlier this afternoon, saying that Salesforce is discussing appointing a new board member. Some of those names that were being discussed, former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra. Now this is for Salesforce. Wall Street Journal now reporting that Elliott is preparing to nominate its own directors here for Salesforce. Again, the stock up, barely in positive territory over the last few months, up just about 3%.]"

Total payment volumes added 7%.That was, however, far lower than last year's 40% surge in cross-border volumes and a 20% jump in payments volumes.""Consumer spending is holding its own – it's certainly not falling off a cliff – but we're seeing more headwinds as the cumulative effects of high inflation and higher interest rates take their toll,"" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com.Visa's revenue rose at the slowest rate in seven quarters, gaining 12% to $7.9 billion.Earlier in the day, rival Mastercard Inc forecast current-quarter revenue growth below expectations as pent-up demand for travel was seen slowing going forward.""Growth in the travel sector may be harder to come by in 2023 as some of the pent-up demand that stacked up during the pandemic and was unleashed in 2022 is fading,"" said Rossman.Visa said in October that while outbound travel from the United States to all geographies continued to pick up steam, a stronger greenback does not bode well for the American tourism industry, which relies heavily on international travelers.The company on Thursday reported a profit of $2.18 a share, comfortably above the $2.01 estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv.(Reporting by Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

He added that OPEC had regained its pricing power and would ensure prices remained elevated.The increase in oil prices projected by Goldman Sachs would represent a 22% rise on current levels of around $81.99 for crude oil.The price of a barrel of oil in the US has dipped more than 33% from highs around $122 reached in June last year, amid an increase in stockpiles and a slowdown in global economic demand.Bhandari also said conversations among investors in Europe had been moving from the effects of a Russian price cap to a Russian product embargo, which will involve the EU banning imports of refined Russian products, such as diesel, naphtha and fuel oil, on February 5.""The fifth of February product embargo could be more disruptive to the product prices, not necessarily crude but to the product prices by way of higher refining margins of diesel,"" Bhandari said.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The pre-event favorites in pairs and ice dance, and now leaders after day one, are all in their 30s.World champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier easily took the largest pairs’ short program lead in nationals history in what may be their last U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, eyeing their fourth U.S. title, put up the biggest gap in a U.S. short dance since its inception in 2011.It’s believed that no pair or dance couple of skaters in their 30s has won a U.S. title in more than 50 years.Knierim and Frazier, who last March became the first U.S. pair to win a world title since 1979, tallied 81.96 points to open the four-day nationals on Thursday.They lead by 15.1 over Emily Chan and Spencer Howe going into Saturday’s free skate in San Jose, California, the largest first-day pairs’ gap since the Code of Points replaced the 6.0 scoring system in 2006.FIGURE SKATING NATIONALS: Full Scores | Broadcast ScheduleThe top three pairs from last year’s event — which Knierim and Frazier missed due to him contracting COVID-19 — are no longer competing together. Knierim and Frazier had a clean skate, while Chan and Howe, who entered as silver medal favorites, counted a fall.After nationals, a committee selects three U.S. pairs for March’s world championships in Japan.Before the fall Grand Prix Series, the 31-year-old Knierim said this will probably be their last season competing together, though the pair also thought they were done last spring. They don’t expect to make a final decision until after a Stars on Ice tour this spring.“I don’t like to just put it out there and say it is the last or not going to be the last because life just has that way of throwing curveballs, and you just never know,” Frazier said this month. “But I would say that this is the first nationals where I’m going to go in really trying to soak up every second as if it is my last because you just don’t know.”Story continuesKnierim is going for a fifth U.S. title, which would tie the record for a pairs’ skater since World War II, joining Kyoka Ina, Tai Babilonia, Randy Gardner, Karol Kennedy and Peter Kennedy. Knierim’s first three titles, and her first Olympics in 2018, were with husband Chris, who retired in 2020.Knierim is also trying to become the first female pairs’ skater in her 30s to win a national title since 1993. Knierim and Chock are trying to become the first female skaters in their 30s to win a U.S. title in any discipline since 1995.After being unable to defend their 2021 U.S. title last year, Knierim and Frazier reeled off a series of historic results in what had long been the country’s weakest discipline.They successfully petitioned for an Olympic spot and placed sixth at the Games, best for a U.S. pair since 2002. They considered retirement after their world title, which was won without the top five teams from the Olympics in attendance. They returned in part to compete as world champions and to give back to U.S. skating, helping set up younger pairs for success.They became the first U.S. pair to win two Grand Prix Series events, then in December became the first U.S. pair to make a Grand Prix Final podium (second place). The world’s top pairs were absent; Russians banned due to the war in Ukraine and Olympic champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong from China leaving competition ice (for now).Knierim and Frazier’s real test isn’t nationals. It’s worlds, where they will likely be the underdog to home favorites Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara, who edged the Americans by 1.3 points in the closest Grand Prix Final pairs’ competition in 12 years.Like Knierim and Frazier, Chock and Bates delivered as overwhelming favorites in Thursday’s rhythm dance.The defending champions tallied 91.90 points, distancing Caroline Green and Michael Parsons, who scored 81.40, going into Saturday’s free dance.“Freedom and joy came through right from the start of the program,” Chock said on USA Network. “There was no holding back.”Last year’s silver and bronze medalists aren’t in the field: Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue retired after winning Olympic bronze, while Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker withdrew last week, citing mental health.So Chock, 30, and Bates, 33, are almost certain to make the podium for an 11th consecutive year, which would be one shy of the record for any discipline, and lead the three couples picked for March’s worlds.“We just want to earn it,” Bates said. “Just because we’ve been around longer than most doesn’t necessarily dictate the results.”Bates, who last year became the oldest U.S. champion in any discipline in decades, has made 12 career senior nationals podiums with Chock and former partner Emily Samuelson. It is believed that a 13th finish in the top three would break the U.S. record for a single discipline he currently shares with Michelle Kwan, Nathaniel Niles and Theresa Weld Blanchard.But Chock and Bates’ sights are set on a place they’ve never been — the top step of a world championships podium. They earned silver or bronze a total of three times, including a bronze last year. The gold and silver medalists aren’t competing this season.However, Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier relegated the Americans to silver at December’s Grand Prix Final.“If we don’t win gold at worlds, we’ll be disappointed,” Bates, whose first senior nationals in 2008 came when this year’s women’s singles favorite, Isabeau Levito, was 10 months old, said earlier this month. “We’ve set the goal for ourselves in the past and haven’t met it yet.”Nationals continue later Thursday with the women’s short.NBC Sports’ Sarah Hughes (not the figure skater) contributed to this report.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

U.S. crude fell $1.33, or 1.6 %, to settle at $79.68, 2% lower on the week.Oil loadings from Russia's Baltic ports are set to rise by 50% this month from December as sellers try to meet strong demand in Asia and benefit from rising global energy prices, traders said and Reuters calculations showed.Urals and KEBCO crude oil loadings from Ust-Luga over Feb. 1-10 may rise to 1.0 million tonnes from 0.9 million in the plan for the same period of January, traders also.""If Russian supply remains strong heading into next month, oil is probably going to continue to trend lower,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.He added that profit taking ahead of the weekend may also have driven prices lower.U.S. energy firms this week kept oil and natural gas rigs steady at 771, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co BKR.O said in its closely followed report on Friday.Meanwhile, OPEC+ delegates meet next week to review crude production levels, with sources from the oil producer group expecting no change to current output policy.The U.S. Federal Reserve's next decision on interest rates will be made at meeting over Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 against a backdrop of a dip in inflation and gross domestic product that grew by a faster than expected 2.9% in the fourth quarter.A 4.2 million barrel build this week in stocks at Cushing, the pricing hub for NYMEX oil futures, also weighed on the market.

334,c7337c8d-44f0-339f-aa05-679c726833af,SNA,2023-01-27,Analysts Estimate Snap-On (SNA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-snap-sna-report-150103011.html,1674745263,STORY,['SNA'],"[Snap-On (SNA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tool and diagnostic equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.15 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.81% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Snap-On?For Snap-On, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Snap-On will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Snap-On would post earnings of $3.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.14, delivering a surprise of +10.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Snap-On doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We have Intel, KLA, Visa, Hasbro, and Salesforce. Kicking it off with Intel, that stock off just about 8% here after-hours. A weak report here from the company, missing on both the top and bottom lines, their guidance coming in a bit light. We certainly are seeing that reflected in the after-hours move here.The CFO of Intel saying that they did take steps to rightsize the business in Q4. We know there are cost cutting efforts. They're looking to cut $3 billion in costs this year, up to $10 billion in 2025. Over the last three months, the stock has gotten a bit of a boost here, up just about 10 and 1/2%, nearly giving all of that back, though, in extended trading.Taking a look at KLA, that stock also under a bit of pressure, off just about 5% right now. The company's sinking as the outlook disappointed. This, of course, follows that drop in the chip demand. So Intel, KLA, those reports disappointing. We're seeing that also reflected in some of those competitors out there. Nvidia stock under pressure, Qualcomm stock under pressure here after-hours. So a couple of names to keep in mind ahead of tomorrow's opening bell.Taking a look at Hasbro, that stock off just about 9% of huge headlines here. They announced their preliminary results, cutting 1,000 jobs, 15% of their workforce. President and COO here, Eric Neiman, will also be leaving the company. The prelim Q4 revenue number missed, EPS coming in a bit light. Holiday sales, quote, ""underperformed."" Certainly, we're seeing that reflected in that 9% drop.Taking a look at Visa, that stock up just about 1 and 1/2% here. The company beating on both the top and the bottom lines. Payment volume up 7%. Visa also saying that effective February 1st, Ryan McInerney will be taking over as CEO. Again, we're looking at gains here after-hours.Rounding it out with Salesforce, that stock under a bit of pressure after popping here in intraday trading, but off just about a half of a percent. A Wall Street Journal report now out saying that Elliott is preparing to nominate directors at Salesforce. It didn't name any specific names, but clearly a battle is heating up for some of those board seats.Now the Journal reports followed the Bloomberg report that we got out earlier this afternoon, saying that Salesforce is discussing appointing a new board member. Some of those names that were being discussed, former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra. Now this is for Salesforce. Wall Street Journal now reporting that Elliott is preparing to nominate its own directors here for Salesforce. Again, the stock up, barely in positive territory over the last few months, up just about 3%.]"

information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.To supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain gains, costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our operating performance and our prospects in the future. Specifically, we believe that the non-GAAP information, including non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA, non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to KLA, non-GAAP gross margin and free cash flow, provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results to help investors compare our operating performances with our results in prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics are inherently subject to significant discretion (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric). As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP. The following are descriptions of the adjustments made to reconcile GAAP net income attributable to KLA to non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA:a.Acquisition-related charges primarily include amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with our acquisitions and dispositions, as well as intangible asset impairment charges.b.Restructuring, severance and other charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance, gains and losses from exiting non-core businesses and adjustments related to non-controlling interest. Restructuring, severance and other charges in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2022, and the six months ended Dec. 31, 2022, include a gain on the sale of Orbograph, Ltd. (""Orbograph""), which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by certain transaction bonuses triggered by the sale of Orbograph.c.Loss on extinguishment of debt includes a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of the $500 million 4.650% Senior Notes due in November 2024.d.Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments includes the income tax effects of the excluded items noted above.e.Discrete tax items in all periods presented include a tax impact relating to the amortization of certain intellectual property as a result of an internal restructuring of ownership rights to align with how our business operates. Discrete tax items in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2022, also consist of a tax expense of $19.8 million from an internal restructuring. Discrete tax items in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2022, include an adjustment of the net benefit of the Orbotech Ltd. 2012 to 2018 Israel tax audit settlement, for which the net benefit includes the liability on the audit settlement less reductions in unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Discrete tax items in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2022, also include a tax impact from the sale of Orbograph. Discrete items in the six months ended Dec. 31, 2022, are the aggregate of the aforementioned discrete tax items. Discrete tax items in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021, consist primarily of a tax expense of $163.7 million from an increase in deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings due to a change in tax law, partially offset by a net benefit of $69.2 million from an internal restructuring. Discrete tax items in the six months ended Dec. 31, 2021, also include a one-time tax benefit of $394.5 million resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kla-corporation-reports-fiscal-2023-second-quarter-results-301731744.htmlSOURCE KLA Corporation]"

We can use results received from a peer, Verizon Communications VZ, as a small gauge. Let’s take a closer look.Verizon Communications Q4 Verizon posted somewhat mixed results, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by a marginal 0.8% and reporting earnings of $1.19 per share.Quarterly revenue topped expectations modestly, reported at $35.2 billion and growing 3.5% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, total wireless service revenue totaled $18.8 billion, climbing nearly 6% from the year-ago quarter thanks to premium adoption and pricing actions implemented by the company.Impressively, total broadband net additions were reported at 416,000, representing the best broadband performance in over ten years and confirming healthy demand for fixed wireless products.And VZ’s cash flow from operations pulled back marginally from the year-ago quarter due to higher device payment receivables, reported at $37.1 billion.Now, onto T-Mobile.T-MobileQuarterly Estimates –Analysts have primarily been bullish for the quarter to be reported, with two positive earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.10 indicates no change in earnings Y/Y.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, our consensus revenue estimate stands at $20.8 billion, suggesting a marginal 0.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter.Quarterly Performance –T-Mobile snapped a streak of positive surprises and posted weak quarterly results in its latest release, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 25%.Top-line results have also left some to be desired, with TMUS missing sales expectations in five consecutive quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation –Currently, T-Mobile shares trade at a 2.2X forward price-to-sales ratio, above the 1.8X five-year median and nearly in line with highs of 2.3X in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company’s price-to-book works out to be 2.6X, above the 2.4X five-year median and just below highs of 2.7X in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTMUS carries a Style Score of “C” for Value.Putting Everything TogetherThe market’s rebound in 2023 has undoubtedly been welcomed with open arms, with a forecasted earnings apocalypse yet to materialize.We’ve received many quarterly prints thus far, and next week, we’ll receive the same from T-Mobile (TMUS).A peer, Verizon Communications VZ, posted somewhat mixed results, falling short of earnings expectations but exceeding revenue estimates.For T-Mobile’s upcoming release, analysts have primarily been bullish, with estimates indicating zero change in earnings but a slight revenue increase Y/Y.Heading into the release, T-Mobile TMUS is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) paired with an Earnings ESP Score of -0.5%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange owes money to Apple, Google, Verizon, Netflix and a slew of companies, including BlackRock, that are fixtures of the Fortune 500.On Wednesday, lawyers for FTX submitted the long-anticipated inventory of FTX’s debt in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, which only included names of institutions and companies, not individual creditors. In early January, the federal judge overseeing the case, John Dorsey, ruled that the names of individuals to whom FTX owes money would be sealed for three months.(On Thursday, lawyers for FTX submitted a filing in court warning that the above list isn't necessarily complete and that creditors can be added and removed as FTX and its subsidiaries continue ""to review their books and records."")FTX's high profile creditor list is just the latest update in the legal sprawl that has enveloped the cryptocurrency exchange and its now disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, since his company, once valued at $32 billion, spectacularly collapsed in November.In addition to the above tech behemoths, FTX also may owe money to large airlines, including American, Spirit, and Southwest. Other creditors include the media with The New York Times, VICE, Fox, and CoinDesk among publications listed in the filing. And even universities are on the list, including Stanford, Florida International, and Northeastern.FTX’s lawyers did not include the amount owed to each of the listed creditors, so the exchange’s debt to each company and institution can potentially be as paltry as unpaid subscription fees. Previous court filings, though, show that FTX owes $3.1 billion to its 50 biggest unsecured creditors, with two customers owed more than $200 million each. This is not to mention the approximately 9.7 million redacted customer names who are also ensnared in FTX’s collapse, according to CoinDesk.Story continuesWhile the names of individual creditors are currently sealed, the new legal filing lists Gisele Bundchen Charitable Giving. Gisele Bündchen is the ex-wife of Tom Brady, who was previously reported to own more than 1.1 million shares in the now-defunct exchange and appeared in the company’s Super Bowl ad.The founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, is currently awaiting trial for fraud in October at his parents' home in Palo Alto. In early January, he pled not guilty. Lawyers for FTX’s bankruptcy case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Update, Jan. 26, 2023 at 5:00 p.m.: Following a new court filing, a note has been added clarifying that the list of creditors is provisional.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

(NYSE:VZ) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 24, 2023Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.Brady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. I hope you all had a chance to read the material. I'm going to briefly discuss the financial highlights before turning the call over to Hans to lead a discussion on our strategy, guidance and forward-looking view of the business. Slide 3 shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth quarter total postpaid net additions in seven years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full quarter contribution from TracFone.Story continuesConsolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.Hans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead. Let me start by saying that we deliver against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we said expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023.The improvement in the consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with FiOS result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year. Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors, such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates.At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvement and take even more actions that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call. The industry entered 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment.We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these three metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We're well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect the wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributor to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years. We are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business, adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how we maximize value.We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions, while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable long-term growth and profitability. As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are architected and built the same, nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different.Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years. In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POP targeted by year-end 2024. C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year.Due to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest user areas first with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience. And where we have built out the C-band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in this market has been encouraging as is evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake.In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-band. With the final trends of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire Continental U.S. When we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more uses and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G standalone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink and position to deliver 5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G and/or among others.We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase were expected in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect there will have 4 million to 5 million fixed subscribers by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans. Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments.Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving the level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of services and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our FiOS footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our FiOS open for sales to more than 70 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead. In summary, network quality is the foundation of our strategy and growth. And all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future.Photo by Brooke Cagle on UnsplashAs I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against three important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all three of these benchmarks. We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wire access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market.This is one of the reasons I assume leadership of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and planned initiatives. After integrating TracFone over last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefit from these actions.In 2023, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive a plan that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market.Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer base. Scaling of new business, such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we're making the appropriate investment to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry.You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financial for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotion incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business. Moving to Business Wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin revenue in order to gain drive improved profitability.While this may result in missing out on revenue, it is a right move and one that will lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies. You may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. The component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system, among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025.So our EBITDA strategy is clear. Grow profitable volumes in both consumer and business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do. By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed water access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth. We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come.That will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx leveraged by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years. With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance.Matthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term outlook. Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services, such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022. As noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a large allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees, which partially recovered network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other revenue.In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolio. We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment.Higher rates of pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense on our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation expense primarily driven by the C-band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-band-related capital spending and we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024.The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year after which all C-band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program. Looking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022 we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash flow in subsequent years. I will now turn it back over to Hans.Hans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year. By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&amp;A.Brady Connor: Thanks, Hans.

346,5114b362-6a1f-3a3c-818d-474f44c58678,SWK,2023-01-27,Earnings Preview: Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-stanley-black-decker-150103887.html,1674745263,STORY,['SWK'],"[The market expects Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tool company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -115.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.94 billion, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black &amp; Decker?For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -69.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black &amp; Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Stanley Black &amp; Decker would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of +4.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Stanley Black &amp; Decker doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street was looking for a profit of $0.25 per share.Here are the most important numbers from the announcement compared to what analysts anticipated, as compiled by Bloomberg.Revenue: $14 billion versus $14.4 billion expectedAdjusted EPS: $0.10 versus $0.19 expectedClient Computing: $6.6 billion versus $7.4 billion expectedDatacenter and AI: $4.3 billion versus $4 billion expectedShares of Intel were off more than 5% immediately following the announcement.Intel's Q1 expectations aren't much better than its Q4 performance.

Earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 20.18%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted Illumina’s fourth-quarter performance. Delays in instruments and consumables purchases, primarily due to the negative foreign exchange impact and consumables inventory deleveraging might also have dented the company’s performance through the fourth quarter.In the last reported quarter, Illumina incurred a huge goodwill impairment charge related to the GRAIL segment, primarily due to the negative impact of current capital market conditions and higher discount rates. This included a stand-alone risk premium on the fair-value calculation of the GRAIL segment, thereby exerting pressure on the bottom line. Going by the recent regulatory updates so far on GRAIL, we expect Illumina to have once again incurred significant legal expenses that might have marred bottom line-growth in the fourth quarter.Customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management and a decline in COVID surveillance revenues are expected to have impeded Illumina’s performance throughout the fourth quarter.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote On a positive note, we expect growth within Core Illumina on the back of growing demand from genetic testing, oncology testing and cancer research customers similar to last reported quarter. The company had a strong customer response to the NovaSeq X Series launch at the Illumina Genomics Forum, where the company reached more than 12,000 viewers in the innovation road map sessions. Customer traction for NovaSeq X exceeded Illumina’s expectation. We believe these developments to have benefited company’s revenue in the fourth quarter.Story continuesIllumina is broadening genomic opportunities across disease states. In October 2022, the company entered into a partnership with General Screen to help countries impacted by tuberculosis to effectively detect and combat multidrug resistant strains. In the same month, Illumina entered into a strategic research collaboration with AstraZeneca to drive drug target discovery by combining their strengths in artificial intelligence (AI)-based genome interpretation and genomic analysis techniques along with industry expertise. We expect these partnerships to have contributed significantly to Illumina’s revenue growth in Q4.In oncology, GRAIL continued to make good progress in Q3, delivering clinical results and signing up a broad range of customers across the health care ecosystem, including health systems and life insurance providers. GRAIL announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Karim Health, the first digital health company, connecting employers and employees to centers of excellence through a value-based care platform. We expect contributions from the GRAIL acquisition to have continued in the to-be reported quarter, adding to top line.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion, suggesting a 12% fall over the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 26 cents indicates an 65.3% slash from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

The company beat estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.49%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health’s retail/long-term care (LTC) segment is likely to have benefited from the enhanced pharmacy and front-store sales growth, similar to the third quarter. With economies reopening and infectious diseases still existing, the segment is likely to have witnessed continued sales of COVID-19 OTC test kits in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s efforts to optimize the retail portfolio, which now consists of three models, including advanced primary care clinics, enhanced health hub locations and traditional CVS pharmacy locations, are likely to have been advantageous for upcoming Q4 results.CVS Health has been making noteworthy progress in expanding access to care through digital and virtual channels. Per the November 2022 update, the company added nearly one million digital customers. During the third quarter, CVS Health launched a new functionality that drives more choice and convenience for patients filling prescriptions.  The company’s digital capabilities for health interactions, prescription services and sales of health and wellness products sales are anticipated to have enhanced consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses. These developments are likely to have benefited the company in the to-be-reported quarter.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation price-eps-surprise | CVS Health Corporation Quote The company also launched a variety of new MinuteClinic virtual care services to support women's health that will be available 24/7.  CVS Health’s contained efforts to expand digital health services and deepen engagement through personalization are expected to have broadened its customer base in Q4, thus adding to its top line.Story continuesOur model suggests retail/LTC revenues of $24.59 billion for the fourth quarter, suggesting 33.5% year-over-year growth.The pharmacy services segment is expected to have recorded robust sales growth, banking on increased pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled, especially with the growing uptake of cough and cold and beauty and personal care products. Also, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation is also likely to have been contributing factors in the pharmacy services arm. We are also positive about the company’s newly developed comprehensive set of programs to manage specialty trends, which includes a formulary exclusion strategy.Moreover, we also expect drug price inflation, new product launch, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. This would simplify and accelerate the process of filling prescriptions, benefitting the business performance in Q4.Our model projects pharmacy services revenues of $38.37 billion for the fourth quarter, suggesting 52.3% year-over-year growth.The healthcare benefits arm is likely to have been driven by sustained membership growth across all product lines. The Medicare franchise, particularly, has been delivering strong results for the company in the past years. The company has achieved a key milestone in the third quarter with more than 2 million members enrolled in its integrated Aetna and Caremark products. We expect this growth momentum to continue, driving growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Further, CVS Health’s competitive cost structure, integrated benefit designs and innovative product portfolio position the healthcare benefits business for further growth.Per our model, the healthcare benefits segment is likely to deliver Q4 sales of $21.17 billion, suggesting 28.8% year-over-year growth.Key Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.91 per share implies a 3.5% fall from the year-ago reported figure. Our model projects Q4 adjusted earnings $1.90 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $74.93 billion, suggesting 2.2% fall from the prior-year reported number.

358,41632f43-6bff-3742-af1d-0d0e7cf05b99,MCK,2023-01-27,Cardinal Health (CAH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cardinal-health-cah-expected-beat-150103977.html,1674745263,STORY,"['CAH', 'MCK']","[Cardinal Health (CAH) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11%.Revenues are expected to be $49.88 billion, up 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.07% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cardinal?For Cardinal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Cardinal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cardinal would post earnings of $0.96 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of +25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cardinal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, McKesson (MCK), is soon expected to post earnings of $6.34 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $70.48 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for McKesson has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.21%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Cardinal Health (CAH) is a stock many investors are watching right now. CAH is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 12.91, which compares to its industry's average of 18.11. CAH's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.81 and as low as 8.75, with a median of 11.06, all within the past year.Investors will also notice that CAH has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CAH's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.69. CAH's PEG has been as high as 8.89 and as low as 1.11, with a median of 2, all within the past year.Another great Medical - Dental Supplies stock you could consider is McKesson (MCK), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of McKesson are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 14.44 and a PEG ratio of 1.43 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 18.11 and 1.69, respectively.Story continuesMCK's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 15.66 and as low as 11.07, with a median of 13.97, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56 and as low as 0.96, with a median of 1.43, all within the past year.McKesson sports a P/B ratio of -42.74 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 6.26. In the past 52 weeks, MCK's P/B has been as high as -24.38, as low as -59.10, with a median of -38.58.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Cardinal Health and McKesson strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the consensus estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 6.86%. Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayZimmer Biomet is expected to have witnessed continued recovery in its legacy business in the fourth quarter, despite the choppy market situation amid real macroeconomic challenges. This is expected to have been driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution within the Knee and Hip businesses.However, the company might have faced upheaval in business, thanks to the global inflationary situation in terms of mounting labor and raw material costs, severe staffing shortages and supply issues, which might have impacted ZBH’s bottom line in the fourth quarter.Further, Zimmer Biomet, which has a broad business base in China, is expected to have come under pressure due to the lingering COVID-led lockdowns and limited trade through the months of the fourth quarter. Further, the implementation of the volume-based procurement program brought down China’s orthopedic device prices, which might have otherwise impacted ZBH’s business in this region.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteWe expect the company to have witnessed strength in its performances within its Hips and Knees product portfolio in the United States. Apart from a strong recovery in elective procedures, easy comparisons outside the United States, along with strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for the Persona knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the United States, and ROSA penetration and pull-through are expected to have contributed to the company’s Knees business.Story continuesThe strong performance of the G7 Revision System and Avenir Complete is likely to have continued during the fourth quarter, thus driving the Hip business in Q4. Internationally, strong procedure recovery and easier comps outside the United States are expected to have driven the fourth-quarter Hip business.However, priority areas like the S.E.T. business (comprising Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) reported a decline in salesin Q3, impacted by a tough comparison with 2021. This might have been once again repeated in Q4. Yet, the company expects the pressure around the S.E.T. business to ease in Q4, thereby contributing to the top line. Zimmer Biomet is also likely to have gained from the September launch of the Identity shoulder system in the United States.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, suggesting a 13.8% decline from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.83 indicates a 6.2% decline from the year-ago adjusted earnings.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.29 billion, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.15% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Air Products and Chemicals?For Air Products and Chemicals, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Air Products and Chemicals will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Air Products and Chemicals would post earnings of $2.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.89, delivering a surprise of +4.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

The executive estimated losses will total about $3 billion this year after the streamer took a $978 million hit in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $559 million the same quarter last year.""We spend quite a bit of money creating content so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe — we like what we're doing,"" Cavanagh added. ""We think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company.""Comcast reported fourth quarter earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines amid greater strength in its broadband and wireless business, in addition to higher advertising and studio unit revenues.Revenue for the quarter grew to $30.55 billion versus the estimated $30.33 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.82 versus the expected $0.77, according to data from Bloomberg.Yet Peacock's mounting losses overshadowed an otherwise upbeat report as adjusted EBITDA for NBCUniversal — which includes its TV and film studios, theme parks, and streaming divisions — decreased 36.3% to $817 million as a result.We wouldn't be investing in Peacock if we didn't think it would return the segment to growth over time...Jeff Shell, NBCUniversal CEOAfter a challenging 2022 for the industry, investors have zeroed in on how difficult it has been for media giants to reach streaming profitability.Disney's (DIS) direct-to-consumer division lost a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on Oct. 1. Meanwhile Paramount (PARA) told investors streaming losses would total about $1.8 billion in 2022 — higher than Wall Street expectations.Story continuesWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has seen its market cap cut in half amid its messy restructuring efforts, reported free cash flow of negative $192 million in the third quarter, compared to $705 million in positive cash flow the year prior.

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriNevertheless, Comcast executives reiterated confidence in the economics of streaming, noting Peacock added 5 million subscribers in the quarter, its best quarterly result since the 2020 launch, fueled by live sports and the recent additions of new films and original content.In total, Peacock subscribers surpassed 20 million at year-end, compared to less than 10 million a year ago, while its revenue nearly tripled to $2.1 billion.""We made a decision to invest in Peacock. It's very clear we picked the right business model and it's very clear our content strength [is] paying off on Peacock,"" said NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell.""We could not be more positive about our trajectory so far...we're right where we expected to be in investment,"" Shell added, explaining the investments made in Peacock were done in an effort to boost the overall media segment ""which we feel more confident [about] today.""""We wouldn't be investing in Peacock if we didn't think it would return the segment to growth over time,"" he said. ""The timing of that is up to market conditions.""Shell went on to explain certain variables including the ad market recovery, linear cable declines, and cost cuts within the linear segment could all impact that timeline.Jeff Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, speaks during a conference at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, France, June 22, 2022. REUTERS/Eric GaillardThe executive pointed to increased improvements within advertising, especially for categories like pharmacy, entertainment, and travel.""The ad market feels to me like it's stabilized a bit,"" said Shell. ""We're assuming it will stay weak for the first half of this year and then recover but who knows with this economy.""""We're doing better than our peers — Peacock growth is helping offset linear weakness which is fortuitous for us,"" he added.Outside of streaming, NBCUniversal's theme park business continued to show strength with revenue increasing 12% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, primarily due to increased attendance and guest spending at the parks in the U.S. and Japan.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Those looking to turn a profit from the closure moved fast, gathering as much merchandise as they possible could.The ride is being shut for what Disney has called a ""reimagining"" of the experience, though it has been criticized in the past for having racist undertones as it is based on the controversial film Song of the South. Walter White, the former executive secretary of the the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, previously said the film ""helps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery.""The film isn't available on Disney+, with Disney's CEO Bob Iger saying it is “not appropriate in today’s world.”Following the closure of Splash Mountain—which has seen Princess Diana among its visitors—items from bags to bottles of ""Splash Mountain water"" to watches and pins have begun appearing on eBay.The authenticity of many items remains to be seen. One listing shows slightly blurry pictures of a plastic water bottle filled with water. On it is scrawled: ""Splash Mountain water, Disney World, last day."" The 16.9-ounce bottle at the time of writing had a current bid of $10,100.00.There have been 39 bids on the item from six bidders, upping the price from the original starting point of $9.99. Whether or not the offers are in jest, the seller has listed the item as nonreturnable.Other batches of water make explicit claims to be the real deal. One bag of water with ""Certified"" scrawled on it in black marker even comes with an apparent certificate.The certificate reads: ""Sealed jar containing water and rocks from Disney Worlds Splash Mountain. Artifacts collected at approximately 3pm from the ride."" It lists the location as coordinates of 28.534483° N -81.411835* W, which relates to a location in Orlando. The certificate adds that the water was ""personally recovered with the assistance of a park employee.""Story continuesAmong the listings do appear to be some bogus sells. Many of the offers include the same picture.Some items have already been sold. A quick look through the listings of shipped items includes a small tub of water from a seller in Florida, which sold for $202. It sold the day after the ride closed and was sent to the United Kingdom. Another listing is for an eight-ounce jar of water from the ""last day"" of the ride. It sold for around $40 and was shipped internationally.Other merchandise relating to the ride is also being listed for big bucks. Eight preowned Splash Mountain figures being sold in Japan are on sale for just over $711. An empty resealable plastic bag featuring the words ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" is on sale for $13 in brand-new condition.Analysis from Google shows that worldwide searches for ""Splash Mountain merchandise"" spiked by 43 index points from Jan. 21 to Jan. 22. Meanwhile searches for ""Splash Mountain water"" inflated 47 points from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21. The vast majority of the searches were from within the United States.The ride will be ""reimagined,"" wrote Michael Ramirez, public relations director at Disneyland Resort in June 2020, adding it will now be based on the film The Princess and the Frog.The change comes after a turbulent time for Disney, as the brand was embroiled in a row over Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill last year. Disney’s CEO at the time, Bob Chapek, faced backlash for not condemning the bill. When he finally did, the move began a feud with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who launched a plan to take control of the governing board for Disney’s sprawling Florida property—and make the entertainment giant assume $700 million in outstanding debt.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

Since grid improvements began in 2011, overall reliability has improved more than 80 percent. In that time, ComEd has avoided more than 19 million power outages for customers, saving more than $3.3 billion in outage-related costs. In 2022, 85 percent, or nearly 3.5 million ComEd customers, experienced zero or one interruption in service.""With growing concerns about carbon emissions and air pollution, we are living in a world that will be increasingly electric,"" said Terence Donnelly, president and chief operating officer of ComEd. ""As people purchase more electric vehicles and appliances, and renewable energy like solar expands across our communities, we will continue to make necessary investments in our system to ensure we are ready to meet demand.""As extreme weather events, electrification and other ComEd customer needs increase, the need to invest in reliable infrastructure grows. ComEd recently filed multiyear grid and rate plans that outline grid work required to support the expansion of renewables such as solar and wind power and beneficial electrification for ComEd customers while maintaining and improving the system to continue the level of reliability customers have come to expect. The plans support the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) that Illinois enacted in 2021, including ensuring that under-resourced communities benefit from the clean energy transition.""The investments we’ve made to this point have improved our overall reliability as demands on the system have grown,"" said Donnelly. ""But as the needs and expectations of our customers evolve, the grid needs to evolve with them.""Story continuesIn addition, the grid plan advances ComEd’s leading role in supporting economic growth across northern Illinois. Companies continue to invest in the region thanks to the unparalleled access to clean, cost-effective and highly reliable power. As one key example, in the last two years, ComEd has brought 28 commercial projects online, including 12 data centers, representing 6,800 jobs and more than $3 billion in local investment.""ComEd's track record for reliability is an asset that the new Greater Chicagoland Economic Partnership will leverage, along with other important attributes, to further enhance the region's competitiveness,"" said Michael Fassnacht, President &amp; CEO of World Business Chicago, and Chief Marketing Officer, City of Chicago. ""We also recognize the need to proactively address issues such as cost-effectiveness and sustainability, and we look forward to working with ComEd to ensure competitive pricing for industrial use and an increased percentage of renewable energy sources for the greater Chicago region. By doing so, we believe the Chicagoland region will become an even more attractive location for business expansion and investment.""""A modern electric grid and access to renewable energy are key factors that companies making location decisions look for,"" said Intersect Illinois CEO Dan Seals. ""ComEd’s investment in reliable infrastructure helps us to attract companies that are committed to a sustainable future.""According to a recent company analysis of 25 peer U.S. energy companies with approximately 1 million customers or more, families and businesses served by ComEd experienced fewer power outages on average than customers of any comparable electric company for a fifth consecutive year in 2021, based on industry standard measures for reliability.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

The impairment was due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business, particularly in China, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels, and the impact of significantly higher interest rates. The Company continues to believe in the strength of the Filorga brand and is confident about its long-term growth opportunities.Full Year 2023 GuidanceBased on current spot rates:The Company expects net sales growth to be 2% to 5% including the benefit from our acquisitions of pet food businesses and a low-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange.The Company expects organic sales growth to be towards the high end of its long-term targeted range of 3% to 5%.On a GAAP basis, the Company expects gross profit margin expansion, increased advertising investment and double-digit earnings-per-share growth.On a non-GAAP (Base Business) basis, the Company expects gross profit margin expansion, increased advertising investment and low to mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.Divisional PerformanceThe following are comments about divisional performance for fourth quarter 2022 versus the year ago period.

CL-EThe Company's annual meeting of stockholders is currently scheduled for Friday, May 12, 2023.Market Share InformationManagement uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce and certain club retailers and discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information reported by the Company may be different from market share information reported by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin levels, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of COVID-19, the impact of the war in Ukraine, cost-reduction plans, including the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, tax rates, interest rates, new product introductions, digital capabilities, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements"" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent filings with the SEC). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following provides definitions and other information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the related prepared materials and webcast, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:Base Business: Base Business refers to non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Base Business operating results exclude, as applicable, charges relating to the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific, acquisition-related costs, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil.Organic sales growth: Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments.Free cash flow before dividends: Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures.This press release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and Organic sales growth (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See ""Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes"" for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 versus 2021 included with this release for a comparison of Organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.Selling, general and administrative expenses, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are disclosed on both an as reported (GAAP) and Base Business (non-GAAP) basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain acquisitions, divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See ""Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.As management uses free cash flow before dividends to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends, fund future business opportunities and repurchase stock, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See ""Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows"" for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.(See attached tables for fourth quarter and full year results.)Table 1Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited)20222021Net sales$4,629$4,403Cost of sales2,0551,844Gross profit2,5742,559Gross profit margin55.6%58.1%Selling, general and administrative expenses1,6331,598Other (income) expense, net1825Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges721571Operating profit202365Operating profit margin4.4%8.3%Non-service related postretirement costs1518Interest (income) expense, net5523Income before income taxes132324Provision for income taxes89136Effective tax rate67.4%42.0%Net income including noncontrolling interests43188Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests3840Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$5$148Earnings per common shareBasic$0.01$0.18Diluted$0.01$0.18Supplemental Income Statement InformationAverage common shares outstandingBasic832.6842.1Diluted834.4845.0Advertising$504$489Table 2Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited)20222021Net sales$17,967$17,421Cost of sales7,7197,046Gross profit10,24810,375Gross profit margin57.0%59.6%Selling, general and administrative expenses6,5656,407Other (income) expense, net6965Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges721571Operating profit2,8933,332Operating profit margin16.1%19.1%Non-service related postretirement costs8070Interest (income) expense, net153175Income before income taxes2,6603,087Provision for income taxes693749Effective tax rate26.1%24.3%Net income including noncontrolling interests1,9672,338Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests182172Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$1,785$2,166Earnings per common shareBasic(1)$2.13$2.56Diluted(1)$2.13$2.55Supplemental Income Statement InformationAverage common shares outstandingBasic836.4845.0Diluted838.8848.3]"

384,6564cfdf-fe1a-3a20-8483-dc05a9121773,JNPR,2023-01-27,Earnings Preview: Qualcomm (QCOM) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-qualcomm-qcom-q1-150103334.html,1674745263,STORY,"['QCOM', 'JNPR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Qualcomm (QCOM) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27.2%.Revenues are expected to be $9.7 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.56% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm?For Qualcomm, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qualcomm will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of $3.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.13, delivering a surprise of +0.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Qualcomm doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, Juniper Networks (JNPR) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +16.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Juniper has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.89%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Juniper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

VSAT recently inked a contract with the United States Marine Corps (USMC) to provide end-to-end satellite communications (SATCOM) support via a fully-managed service. The agreement extends the pilot and follow-on service program that Viasat completed in fiscal 2022.Earlier, the company successfully delivered a fully-managed SATCOM as a Managed Service (SaaMS) solution to the USMC I Marine Expeditionary Force (“I MEF”), the largest warfighting unit in the Marine Corps.This fully-managed SATCOM service includes a scalable, quickly deployable and resilient beyond-line-of-sight communication capability. Using on-demand satellite communication and data transmission, this technology allows I MEF to extend its command and control to the tactical edge and support Marine exercises, Marine Expeditionary Units and Stand in Force rotational deployments.The SaaMS offers better adaptability to fulfill dynamic connectivity requirements, facilitate multi-domain operations and improve the safety of deployed forces through dependable and robust communications. The solution offers always-on, smooth roaming throughout Viasat's high-capacity commercial networks. The service's integrated Viasat Unified Customer Experience Portal will provide operational commanders and network managers with near real-time situational awareness, facilitating improved near real-time comprehension throughout the entire network.Viasat operates in a dynamic and competitive market, including stalwarts from varied industries. The Government Systems segment faces threats from manufacturers of defense electronics products and systems such as General Dynamics.  In order to combat such competitive pressure, Viasat has to continuously customize its network offering as per needs, enhance the cost-effectiveness of its products and services and boost the satellite data networks. Increased competition results in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share.Viasat has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 350%, on average.

Data analytics company Nielsen may have found out. Americans-- get this-- streamed more than 19 million years' worth of content last year in 2022. That's according to Nielsen. That's up 27% from 2021. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal is here with us. And Allie, clearly lots of binge watching seem to be going on. What shows came out on top?ALLIE CANAL: Oh, yes, and according to this report, the 2022 streaming champion was Netflix. Now Nielsen looked at top overall programs, top originals, top acquired content, and then top streaming movies. And out of all of those categories, Netflix was the winner 39 times out of 58, followed by Disney+ with HBO Max sneaking in there, thanks to ""Friends,"" which, ironically, it acquired from Netflix back in 2020. But if we take a look at the top five overall programs, that included hits like ""Stranger Things,"" ""NCIS,"" ""Encanto.""But I want to zero in on original programming because this is where Netflix really shines, and it's a testament to the steep investments the company has made in its programming over the past years, especially for the more episodic content that we see from them with titles like ""Wednesday,"" ""Ozark,"" ""Bridgerton"" making the top five list. And while Netflix does have a few popular movies, Disney actually had the most success when it comes to streaming films. That Disney IP just seems to hold a lot of weight with consumers and remains one of the main drivers for Disney+ subscriptions.So, super interesting to see all of this data laid out since at the end of the day, the streaming wars is really just a content war. And I think that's why we've seen Netflix continue to be successful and to continue to dominate this space. We'll see if the competition can eventually catch up, especially as they make their own respective investments. But for now, it's clearly a Netflix and chill type of vibe going on out there.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Well, that's not great for this next company we're about to talk about because Comcast out with fourth quarter earnings, and that streaming war tends to get very expensive. And is that what stood out for you from the report as far as Peacock goes?ALLIE CANAL: Absolutely, and it was a very interesting report with Peacock because on the one hand, we did see an addition of 5 million new subscribers, but on the other hand, they reported a loss, nearly $1 billion just in that Peacock division. And this is a narrative that we've really seen across the media sector. More growth usually comes at that pretty steep cost. You can take a look at Disney as another example of this after that company reported a loss of 4 billion plus in its fiscal 2022 results.But on the Comcast earnings call earlier this morning, executives did maintain that they expect peak streaming losses in 2023 estimated at about 3 billion. And they did remain confident that Peacock is the right business model for the company at this time. We heard from Jeff Shell. He's the CEO at NBCUniversal. And he said that they would not be investing in Peacock if they did not expect the streamer to lift the overall media segment to growth over time.Now, over time, that's very broad, and Shell did warn that there are a few macroeconomic factors that could weigh on that timeline, such as the ad market recovery, linear cable declines, cost cuts, et cetera. But for now, it was very clear on the call that they are not abandoning Peacock. They're not abandoning streaming. They do have more than 20 million subscribers on the Peacock app, which is more than double the 10 million users the app had this time last year. So overall, not a bad quarter, but again, those macroeconomic headwinds and those accelerated losses did seem to overshadow things a little bit this morning.]"

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Low Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks To Buy15 Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stocks Disclosure: None. 15 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the stock market, you can go directly to see the 5 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks To Buy.The US stock market has been bearish throughout 2022, with most stocks taking a beating and share prices going on the decline. As a result, many stocks today are trading at attractive valuations, making now the time to buy into major companies while they are trading at a significant discount.Major stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc.

The market's position too is not expected to improve too fast. According to a Barron's article published this January, Jeremy Grantham, an investor and the co-founder of the investment firm GMO, has recently commented that the stock market is still expected to undergo severe trials. Grantham estimates that the trend line value of the S&amp;P 500 will be around 3,200 by the end of 2023. A drop to 3,200 would represent a 17% fall for the year, and a 20% decline from the S&amp;P 500's finish on January 24, which stood at 4,019.81.However, the market situation is not entirely bleak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's performance so far in 2023 has been optimistic. According to a CNBC article published this January, the Dow gained about 104.40 points, or 0.31%, on January 24.

Here's what the firm said:“Meta Platforms detracted from performance during the quarter and for most of the year. Meta’s advertising revenue grew slightly (currency-adjusted) over 2021 but was up over +60% compared to 2019 (pre-Pandemic). The Company reported 2.9 billion “daily active users (DAUs)” of its Family of Apps (as of September 2022), up nearly +30% from December 2019. Despite these impressive gains, the stock now trades at absolute levels well below where it traded before the Pandemic. Much of the market’s concern revolves around slowing revenue growth and aggressive reinvestment. It is now quite evident that there was a tremendous pull-forward of demand for many businesses and services over the past couple of years. The normalization of revenue growth from that pull-forward is hardly an existential crisis. Further, while Meta’s profit margins have fallen below pre-Pandemic levels, the business likely hired well in excess of what it needed because it assumed the Pandemic induced growth would continue. Meta has plenty of room to moderate its expense base and drive significant value by repurchasing shares at today’s historically depressed multiples.”8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

This compares to earnings of $1.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 26.98%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this manager of loyalty and rewards programs for retailers and others would post earnings of $2.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.69, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Bread Financial , which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $1.03 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $855 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Bread Financial shares have added about 13.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Bread Financial?While Bread Financial has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Bread Financial: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $7.51 on $1.03 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.25 on $4.09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

As of Jun 30, the company's total restaurant count was 12,409.ConcernsTraffic continues to be impacted due to coronavirus-related regulations. In the third quarter, the company's operations were affected by multiple COVID outbreaks in China. Tightened COVID curbs (including partial lockdowns and suspension of restaurant dine-in services) were implemented to counter the same. The measures resulted in restricted mobility and reduced travel.Moreover, Yum China is facing structurally high cost of labor and rentals. Apart from wage inflation, the company is bearing additional costs stemming from promotion, packaging upgrades, menu innovation and technological novelty. To curb labor costs, it is increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is expected to curb margins in the near term.

However, high costs and dismal China performance continues to affect the company.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversStarbucks’ North America comps have impressed investors for the seventh straight quarter rising 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter, owing to an improvement of 10% in average ticket. Global comparable store sales increased 7% year over year, primarily driven by an 8% rise in average tickets. For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of 7-9% target range.The management focuses on increasing global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, aggressive product innovation and brand building. In the second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Starbucks opened 313, 318 and 763 net new stores worldwide, respectively, taking the total store count to 35,711.In fiscal 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion. Consolidated revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 10-12% on a year-over-year basis.For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth to be at the low end of 15-20% range.Starbucks, which share space with McDonald's Corporation MCD, Yum!

Meanwhile, the company’s Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room elevates the coffee experience to the next level, with small-batch super-premium coffee produced using innovative coffee-brewing techniques.Story continuesConcernsThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. During the fiscal fourth quarter, comps in China declined 16% year over year. The downtick was caused by a 17% decline in transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average tickets.China continues to battle COVID-19 resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. During first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s performance in China is expected to be affected by COVID-19.Moreover, high costs continue to affect the company’s performance. SBUX’s margin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by inflationary pressures along with increased investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training).

417,4a197144-7069-37ad-a65b-f14f91232e3b,AON,2023-01-27,Can Aflac's (AFL) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates on Lower Expenses?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflacs-afl-q4-earnings-beat-121512565.html,1674735312,STORY,"['AFL', 'HIG-PG', 'AON']","[Aflac Incorporated AFL is set to continue its earnings beat streak in the fourth quarter of 2022, the results of which are expected to be released on Feb 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading insurance provider reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.23, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, due to reduced benefits and expenses, partly offset by a variable investment income loss from alternative investments and a weaker contribution to revenues from its Japan and U.S. businesses.Now, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.21 has witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against no movement in the opposite direction. The estimated figure, however, suggests a decrease of 5.5% from the prior-year reported number.Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.22 per share suggests a 4.9% year-over-year decline. Aflac beat the consensus estimate in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 4.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $4.5 billion indicate a 17.4% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Aflac this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently +1.29%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.23 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: Aflac currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.Factors to NoteAFL’s U.S. operations in the fourth quarter are likely to have benefited from the Fed interest rate hikes, but Japan’s operations are likely to have been affected by adversities on sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income of $824 indicates a 9.5% year-over-year decrease while our estimate suggests a 13% decline. This is likely to have been partially offset by improved returns from alternative investments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total net earned premiums is pegged at $3,544 million, signaling a decline of 16.5% from a year ago while our estimate suggests a 20.2% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. This is likely to have resulted in a year-over-year decrease in AFL’s bottom line.The consensus mark for pre-tax income in Aflac Japan is pegged at $705 million, signaling a decrease of 20.5% from the year-ago period. We expect the metric to fall 25.4% year over year in the fourth quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for pre-tax income in Aflac U.S. is pegged at $285 million, indicating a 9.2% increase from a year ago due to lower costs. This is likely to have positioned the company for an earnings beat in the fourth quarter.Thanks to Aflac’s multiple cost-curbing efforts, expenses are likely to have declined in the quarter under review. A reduction in operations is expected to have played part in lowering costs, partially offsetting the fall in profit levels. Our estimate for total benefits and expenses suggests a 20% year-over-year decrease.The company is expected to have made substantial investments in core technology platforms or digital capabilities. Among these platforms, AFL remains steadfast in upgrading its dental and vision platforms to manage higher volumes. The investments are aimed at boosting operational efficiencies and triggering accretive growth in earned premiums in the long run.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader finance space that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Ares Capital Corporation ARCC has an Earnings ESP of +9.58% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ares Capital’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 56 cents per share, implying a 7.7% improvement from the year-ago figure. ARCC beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with an average surprise of 3%.Aon plc AON has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AON’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.67 per share, which witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against one downward movement. AON beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 2.8%.The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hartford Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.86 per share, which improved 1.1% in the past 60 days.

CMCSA, Aon plc AON, Trane Technologies plc TT, Huntington Bancshares Inc. HBAN and Teleflex Inc. TFX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Comcast, AON and Trane TechnologiesThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Comcast Corp., Aon plc and Trane Technologies plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Comcast have declined -17.4% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry's decline of -23.1% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -8.9% pullback. The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.On the positive side, Comcast should continue to benefit from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the third quarter. Broadband user base increased in the last reported quarter on October 27th (the company is scheduled to report Q4 results on Thursday, January 26th). Comcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Aon shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the past year (+21.2% vs. +14.4%). The company's top line has been growing on buyouts and alliances, which have enhanced its capabilities and made it one of the largest insurance brokers. Solid Reinsurance Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions segments continue to drive the top line.Aon has been divesting non-core operations to streamline its business. It expects that focusing on more profitable operations will generate a higher return on equity. Its pooled employer plan has reached the milestone of $1 billion in U.S. assets and commitments.The company engages in prudent capital deployment. It had around $6.7 billion fund left under its share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2022. Yet, elevated operating costs can put pressure on margins. A debt-laden balance sheet compared with a lower cash balance raises a concern.(You can read the full research report on Aon here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Trane Technologies shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (+1.3% vs. -30.4%). The company remains focused on improving the quality of its products and services and operating efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in earnings and cash flow. It prioritizes improving its business operating system and innovation through business transformation initiatives and prudent investments.Trane has a track record of repurchasing shares and paying dividends consistently. Such moves instil investor confidence and positively impact the company's bottom line.However, product and service diversity put's Trane in the face of fierce competition in terms of price, quantity, delivery, service, support, technology and innovation. The company's business experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Lower liquidity remains a concern. Partly due to these headwinds, the stock has declined in the past year.(You can read the full research report on Trane Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Huntington Bancshares Inc. and Teleflex Inc..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

419,c70589d0-2e79-33be-a61e-70caf4a8c93c,MCD,2023-01-27,McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold US$3.7m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-mcd-insiders-120027899.html,1674820827,STORY,['MCD'],"[Many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$256 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$275, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in McDonald's than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does McDonald's Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$188m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the McDonald's insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - McDonald's has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

YUMC has been witnessing growth trends courtesy of various approaches like menu innovation, robust loyalty program, expansion efforts, strong brand recognition and focus on digitalization. However, macroeconomic risks in China, coronavirus-related risks and inflationary pressure have been hurting its performance.Driving FactorsYUMC’s riveting growth potential resides in its continual menu innovation to encourage top-line growth. The company is expanding its presence in the coffee segment, as it believes that the beverage has strong demand in China. The company is expanding its takeaway and ready-to-cook business through menu innovation and making it more convenient for consumers.The company, which shares space with McDonald's Corporation MCD, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM, Starbucks Corporation SBUX, holds a leadership position in the Chinese restaurant space when it comes to delivery, mobile order and pay and loyalty membership. The company is increasingly shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand its customer base.The company has been leveraging the power of its two most important brands — KFC and Pizza Hut— to drive long-term growth. It focuses on relentless unit growth of restaurants to drive incremental sales. The company emphasizes on expanding its supply chain network to support store and portfolio growth and enhance intelligent supply chain operations.Despite unfavorable economic conditions, the company opened 246 and 403 gross new restaurants, respectively, driven by the development of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands, during the second and third quarters of 2022. As of Jun 30, the company's total restaurant count was 12,409.ConcernsTraffic continues to be impacted due to coronavirus-related regulations. In the third quarter, the company's operations were affected by multiple COVID outbreaks in China. Tightened COVID curbs (including partial lockdowns and suspension of restaurant dine-in services) were implemented to counter the same. The measures resulted in restricted mobility and reduced travel.Moreover, Yum China is facing structurally high cost of labor and rentals. Apart from wage inflation, the company is bearing additional costs stemming from promotion, packaging upgrades, menu innovation and technological novelty. To curb labor costs, it is increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is expected to curb margins in the near term. Costs related to transactions and franchises are expected to increase in the near future.Story continuesA Brief Review of the Other PlayersMcDonald's: The company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In third-quarter 2022, global comps advanced 9.5%. McDonald’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. The company is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help the company to drive long-term growth and capture market share.Yum!

Moreover, it has implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance the guest experience. The company has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive so far.

However, high costs and dismal China performance continues to affect the company.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversStarbucks’ North America comps have impressed investors for the seventh straight quarter rising 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter, owing to an improvement of 10% in average ticket. Global comparable store sales increased 7% year over year, primarily driven by an 8% rise in average tickets. For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of 7-9% target range.The management focuses on increasing global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, aggressive product innovation and brand building. In the second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Starbucks opened 313, 318 and 763 net new stores worldwide, respectively, taking the total store count to 35,711.In fiscal 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion. Consolidated revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 10-12% on a year-over-year basis.For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth to be at the low end of 15-20% range.Starbucks, which share space with McDonald's Corporation MCD, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM, Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC, is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings.Apart from the numerous beverage innovations, Starbucks has also been making an effort to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers. Meanwhile, the company’s Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room elevates the coffee experience to the next level, with small-batch super-premium coffee produced using innovative coffee-brewing techniques.ConcernsThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. During the fiscal fourth quarter, comps in China declined 16% year over year. The downtick was caused by a 17% decline in transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average tickets.China continues to battle COVID-19 resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. During first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s performance in China is expected to be affected by COVID-19.Moreover, high costs continue to affect the company’s performance. SBUX’s margin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by inflationary pressures along with increased investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training). Reduced traffic in China (due to COVID-19-related restrictions) also added to the woes.A Brief Review of Other StocksMcDonald's: The company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth.

PLD is well-positioned to bank on the favorable industrial real estate market environment, backed by its solid operating platform and robust scale. The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing the solid demand for its industrial real estate, as reflected by the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of the properties.Undoubtedly, with the e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has risen. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper and benefit Prologis, STAG Industrial, Inc. STAG and First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR.Resilience is essential to the future supply chain. Therefore, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from a likely increase in inventory levels, offering possibilities to industrial landlords, including Prologis, STAG Industrial and First Industrial Realty, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Prologis, in particular, has been witnessing a decent operating performance. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio was 98% in the fourth quarter.Further, 42.5 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 36.9 msf in the operating portfolio and 5.6 msf in the development portfolio in the fourth quarter. The retention level was 82.4% in the quarter, up from 76.4% in the prior quarter.Prologis’ share of net effective rent change came in at 50.6% in the October-December quarter, which was led by the United States at 55%. The cash rent change was 32.4%.Cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew 9.1% in the fourth quarter, which was led by the United States at 9.6%. For 2023, management expects cash same-store NOI (Prologis share) in the range of 8.5-9.5%.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. In October 2022, PLD closed the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, including the assumption of debt, boosting its presence in the key markets of the United States.Moreover, in 2022, the company’s share of acquisitions amounted to $2.07 billion, with a weighted average stabilized cap rate (excluding other real estate) of 4.3%. For 2023, the company anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 million and $600 million, while development starts are expected in the range of $2.5-$3 billion.Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $4.1 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Dec 31, 2022. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, PLD is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis remains committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 11.91%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.However, with the asset category being attractive in these challenging times, there is a development boom in many markets. This high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to affect pressure on the vacancy level and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters.Also, the stabilization of e-commerce sales growth raises concerns for Prologis. Moreover, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for PLD. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As always, following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. Let me now turn the call over to you, Dave, for opening remarks.Dave Mosley : Thanks, Shayne. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Seagate delivered on what we set out to do in the December quarter, and I'm proud of our team's accomplishments amid this tough business environment. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range and free cash flow generation increased by more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are managing well what is in our control and executed on the actions we outlined on our October call. We retired more than $200 million in debt, strengthening our balance sheet. We lowered operational costs by realizing a meaningful portion of the expected savings from our restructuring efforts. We reduced capital expenditures by more than 40% sequentially while still accelerating the launch and development schedules for new mass capacity products, and we adjusted our factory production output to support strong supply discipline as demand recovers.These actions, we believe, put Seagate on solid footing to weather the near-term industry dynamics while continuing to make the technology investments to meet our customers' evolving needs and thrive over the long term. Relative to market conditions, three primary external factors have been impacting our business over the past several months. The COVID-related economic slowdown in China, the work down of nearline HDD inventories among U.S. cloud and global enterprise customers under a more cautious demand environment and macro-related disruptions primarily impacting our consumer-facing markets. These factors remained at play during the December quarter and weighed heavily on the mass capacity markets, resulting in a 10% sequential decline in mass capacity revenue.Having said that, we are already seeing some encouraging indicators. Within China, we believe first steps toward recovery are being implemented through government policies aimed at improving economic conditions including the faster-than-expected reversal of zero COVID restrictions and a show of confidence following the policy shift several major banks raised their 2023 outlook for China's GDP. We expect it will take time for consumers and businesses to work through disruptions related to the COVID policy pivot and for the economy to fully reopen. Based on our customer conversations, we anticipate regional sales into the VIA and nearline markets to remain subdued in the March quarter and gradually improve as the calendar year unfolds. We will continue to monitor demand signals and expect to gain a better picture following the Lunar New Year celebrations.Turning to the U.S. cloud and enterprise markets. Customers have focused on working down the HDD inventory levels that were built up during the pandemic as non-HDD component shortages created inventory imbalances. We believe some progress has been made in recent months supported by an improvement in non-HDD component availability. While inventory adjustments are customer-by-customer event, and ongoing macro uncertainties have led to more cautious near-term buying decisions, we expect nearline sales will improve slightly in the current quarter, particularly for our high-capacity drives. Our view is supported by the ongoing adoption of our 20-plus terabyte family of nearline products, which represented close to 60% of nearline exabyte shipments in the December quarter and is expected to trend even higher in the current quarter.Relative to our products, we are seeing a wider variety of nearline capacity points and configurations being adopted across our customer base, depending on their specific data center architectures, workloads and application needs. Seagate is well equipped to address these individual unique requirements with our deep customer relationships and broad technology portfolio, spanning traditional perpendicular recording technology or PMR drives to performance-oriented dual actuator products to TCO enhancing SMR technology. In addition to our device portfolio, Seagate's Systems business offers cost-efficient, scalable petabyte solutions for both enterprise and cloud customers. While system sales were down sequentially off of a very strong September quarter, we captured a record number of new customer wins with our CORVAULT products.CORVAULT offers features such as self-healing, autonomous drive regeneration, which increases productivity while reducing electronic waste. The momentum that we're seeing across the systems business supports revenue to move higher in fiscal 2023. Our strong product pipeline is underpinned by the technology advancements we're bringing to market. We are leveraging our technology leadership to scale drive capacities through aerial density gains rather than additional heads and disks. As a result, we can deliver our trademark TCO advantages to customers with attractive margin opportunities for Seagate. Our 20-terabyte product features 2 terabyte per disk capacities and we have started to ramp the volume of 22 terabyte products deployed on 2.2 terabyte per disk capacities.The 20-plus terabyte platform is based on traditional PMR technology. And some customers are choosing to enable SMR technology as an additional feature that slightly increases the drives capacity for certain applications. In the December quarter, about 35% of our nearline exabyte shipments were deployed as SMR drives. We are executing plans to deliver another 10% gain in per disk capacity for this PMR platform to offer drives in the mid- to upper 20 terabyte range. However, I'm most excited made on our HAMR technology. It was nearly four years ago to the day that I first shared our lab results demonstrating 3 byte per disk capacity. And today, we have demonstrated capacities of 5 terabytes per disc in our recording physics labs. In the current market environment, we've been taking advantage of our reduced factory utilization to accelerate cycles of learning around HAMR productization.We are meeting or exceeding all product development milestones and reliability metrics, and we will be shipping prequalification units to key cloud customers in the coming weeks. As a result of this progress, we now expect to launch our 30-plus terabyte platform in the June quarter, slightly ahead of schedule. The speed of the initial HAMR volume ramp will depend on a number of factors, including product yields and customer qualification time lines. However, we plan to use our systems business to quicken the pace of learning and time to yield. Our tremendous progress reinforces my confidence in HAMR products and our ability to execute. These innovations were only possible through the hard work and dedication of our global team, and I would like to thank them for their many efforts.Our multi-decade focus on HAMR R&amp;D and our innovation across all facets of drive production have resulted in a development advantage that we believe is measured in years, and we're excited by our collaborations with customers on HAMR capabilities. The technology innovations driving aerial density higher will deliver strong and consistent cost reductions at the highest drive capacities and enable future cost-efficient refreshes of our midrange capacity drives. We believe these products serve as the foundation to expand our margin profile back into and possibly beyond the long-term target range. Wrapping up, Seagate is executing with speed and agility through the near-term macro challenges. We've made meaningful improvements to our cost structure and balance sheet while steadily advancing our product and technology road maps.With signs starting to emerge that market conditions could improve as we progress through the calendar year, Seagate is well positioned with an industry-leading mass capacity portfolio that we believe supports the return to our long-term financial model over time. Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to Gianluca.softwarePhoto by Danial Igdery on UnsplashGianluca Romano: Thank you, Dave. Seagate is navigating through the near-term macroeconomic cross-currents and executed to plan in the December quarter. We delivered top and bottom line results that came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, revenue of $1.89 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share. Our actions to reduce costs, strengthen the balance sheet and improve long-term profitability have yielded desired outcomes, including a continuation of positive free cash flow generation, without sacrificing investment necessary to extend our technology leadership. Total hard disk drive shipments were 113 exabytes in the December quarter, down 5% quarter-over-quarter, with HDD revenue declining 6% sequentially to $1.7 billion.Multiple factors led to an expected decline in the mass capacity business, including the inventory correction among cloud and enterprise customers, COVID-related disruption in China and Seagate own action to reduce production. Mass capacity sales were offset by a slight seasonal improvement in the legacy market. Shipment into mass capacity markets totaled 97 exabytes, down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Of this total, roughly 82% were derived from nearline products, shifting to cloud and enterprise OEM customers. Nearline shipments of 80 exabytes were down 6% sequentially and roughly 30% of our recent high. We believe the actions we have taken to quickly adjust our production output have aided customers to start making progress in working down their inventory levels.The degree of progress vary from customer to customer and notwithstanding the current macroeconomic uncertainties, we would expect it will take a few more months to reach more normalized inventory level across the customer base. On a revenue basis, mass capacity sales were down 10% sequentially to $1.2 billion, reflecting the nearline trend that I just described as well as lower demand in the VIA market. As we expected, the prolonged economic slowdown in China continued to impact sales of our VIA products, and we did not see the typical seasonal pickup in sales during the December quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, the Chinese government is taking action to boost the country economy, including the rapid reversal of COVID policy restriction.It will take time for these changes to take effect. And while still early, emerging customer dialogue support these encouraging leading indicators. As a result, we anticipate conditions to gradually improve over the next couple of quarters. Within the legacy market, revenue was $421 million, up 8% sequentially, primarily driven by a seasonal uptick in consumer demand, although a more subdued level compared to prior year. Finally, revenue for our non-HDD business was $224 million, down 15% sequentially, reflecting the expected decline in our enterprise system business following a very strong September quarter. Overall, we are making great strides in growing the system business, increasing sales of our branded channel products and building customer momentum with our CORVAULT self-healing technology.While we are continuing to navigate lingering supply constraint for a couple of system components, we expect non-HDD revenue to improve through the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving to our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the December quarter was $403 million. Embedded in that figure are the underutilization costs associated with lowering production output to support inventory reduction, both as a customer and on our own balance sheet. Underutilization costs of $79 million were somewhat higher than we had projected at the onset of the December quarter and translated into a 420 basis point of margin headwind. Accounting for risk costs, non-GAAP gross margin was 21.4%, down from 24.5% in the prior quarter. Based on our current outlook, we are planning to begin ramping production output in the March quarter, sometime after the Lunar New Year.Cost and efficiencies associated with restarting and ramping of production are expected to largely offset the benefit of lower underutilization costs for the March quarter. However, as demand recovers in the coming quarters, we expect both gross profit and gross margin to move higher. We significantly reduced non-GAAP operating expenses to $294 million, down $20 million quarter-over-quarter due to savings associated with our restructuring plans and proactive expense management. We expect quarterly non-GAAP OpEx to remain around the $300 million level through the balance of the fiscal year 2023. Based on the diluted share count of approximately 207 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the December quarter was $0.16. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow.We executed planning action to strengthen our balance sheet over the near term. We ended the December quarter with a liquidity level of approximately $2.5 billion, including our revolving credit facilities, flat with the prior quarter. We believe these levels are sufficient to support our strategic plans and meet customer demand. We drove a significant reduction in inventory to approximately $1.2 billion, down $400 million from the prior quarter, reflecting our effort to work down strategic inventory and finished goods. We expect inventory to remain around this level over the next couple of quarters, but we'll continue to focus on aligning our supply chain and finished good level to the prevailing demand environment. We reduced capital expenditures to $79 million, down 41% quarter-over-quarter.CapEx is expected to trend lower through the second half of the fiscal year with total fiscal year expenditure below the long-term target range of 4% to 6% of revenue. Free cash flow generation was $172 million, up 54% sequentially with lower capital expenditure and a $51 million improvement in working capital. We expect free cash flow to remain positive throughout calendar year 2023 and more than sufficient to support our dividend program. We used $145 million for the quarterly dividend. And as previously communicated, we paused our share repurchase program, exiting the quarter with 206 million shares outstanding. We are not currently planning to repurchase any share for the balance of the fiscal year, consistent with our near-term focus on optimizing cash flow through the current macro environment.Returning capital to shareholders remains an important aspect of our financial model, and we will assess resuming our program in fiscal 2024, depending on business conditions. We lowered overall debt by approximately $220 million, largely through a debt exchange, requiring minimal cash outlay. Additional, we successfully renegotiated our debt covenants to temporarily increase the leverage ratio to 5x. Our debt balance exiting the quarter was $6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months totaled $1.6 billion, resulting in a gross debt leverage ratio of 3.8x. Interest expense in the December quarter was $77 million and is expected to be approximately $82 million for the March quarter, reflecting higher interest rate associated with the new debt.We continue to evaluate options related to debt structure and reducing interest expense. Turning to our outlook for the March quarter. The broader macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to impact the business environment and shape of recovery. However, as indicated earlier, we are encouraged by the actions being taken to improve economic condition in Asia and the early indication with cloud and enterprise customer inventory levels are trending lower. As a result, we expect March quarter revenue to be in the range of $2 billion, plus or minus $150 million, up about 6% quarter-over-quarter at the midpoint. We project incremental improvement in the mass capacity business from cloud and enterprise customers and higher system sales to offset seasonally decline in the legacy market.At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the mid- to upper single-digit range, which includes both underutilization costs and inefficiencies associated with the resuming production output. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.25, plus or minus $0.20. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.Dave Mosley : Thanks, Gianluca. Seagate continues to demonstrate resilience in the most dynamic of times. We are executing on what is within our control, generating positive free cash flow and advancing our product road map. As I indicated earlier, we expect mass capacity market conditions to gradually improve as we progress through the calendar year, which supports stronger revenue and profitability in the back half of 2023. Longer term, we remain excited by the secular trends driving demand for mass capacity storage, and Seagate unique capabilities to capture these future growth opportunities. We are leveraging our aerial density leadership to increase capacity per disk, which we believe enables the most cost-efficient product solutions for mass capacity storage.We will begin shipping products based on 3-plus terabyte per disk capacities in the coming months, which is up to 35% more than comparable drive capacities available today. Amid a challenging macro and industry backdrop, I'm incredibly proud of the partnerships and hard work from our suppliers, customers and our employees. Earlier this week, we published our fourth annual diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights how Seagate aims to build and support its global team. The principles outlined in this report are foundational to Seagate's technology innovations and long-term success. I encourage you to read the report in full on our website. I will conclude by thanking our shareholders for your ongoing support. Our objective remains taking the decisive steps to best position Seagate for long-term value creation.Gianluca and I will now take your questions.See also 11 Most Undervalued Bank Stocks and 12 Hot Penny Stocks On the Move.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This simplifies the Company's go-to-market brand structure for clients and candidates and provides leverage for greater brand awareness and allows future flexibility to expand the Company's existing practice groups without the need for new brands. The Company's financial disclosures for contract talent solutions (formerly temporary and consultant staffing) are based on functional specialization rather than the previously branded divisions. The functional specializations are: finance and accounting, administrative and customer support, and technology. Finance and accounting combines the former Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources, administrative and customer support was previously OfficeTeam, and technology was formerly Robert Half Technology. Protiviti and permanent placement talent solutions continue to be reported separately. What was previously referred to as staffing operations is now referred to as talent solutions. There is no change to the underlying business operations or organization.The Company's presentation of service revenues for finance and accounting, administrative and customer support, and technology include intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the Company's blended business solutions. This is how the Company measures and manages these businesses internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti are aggregated and then eliminated as a single line item. The Company has prepared the below schedule to provide readers with historical comparative information to better evaluate the related trends.202020212022Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4SERVICE REVENUES:Finance and accounting$   701,762$   496,573$   506,515$   552,116$   600,387$   663,892$   732,365$   768,204$   801,690$   810,910$   805,229$   767,354Administrative and customer   support239,979136,299173,685214,985220,467263,192279,370295,872284,906274,141250,531233,056Technology196,652162,028161,007175,730172,239194,233215,500213,414213,327218,190216,735209,009Elimination of intersegment   revenues (46,273)(41,514)(59,816)(92,393)(103,818)(143,036)(172,534)(161,004)(144,200)(137,548)(132,745)(137,738)Total contract talent solutions1,092,120753,386781,391850,438889,275978,2811,054,7011,116,4861,155,7231,165,6931,139,7501,071,681Permanent placement talent    solutions120,48971,03087,20391,387111,703143,640156,444158,133186,782200,096182,329155,948Protiviti294,082283,910321,303362,261397,402458,660501,421495,298472,329497,038511,376499,397Total service revenues$  1,506,691$  1,108,326$  1,189,897$  1,304,086$  1,398,380$  1,580,581$  1,712,566$  1,769,917$  1,814,834$  1,862,827$  1,833,455$  1,727,026 ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the ""Company"") are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; combined segment income; and as adjusted revenue growth rates.The following measures: adjusted gross margin and adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses include gains and losses on investments held to fund the Company's obligations under employee deferred compensation plans. The Company provides these measures because they are used by management to review its operational results.Combined segment income is income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. The Company provides combined segment income because it is how management evaluates segment performance.As adjusted revenue growth rates represent year-over-year revenue growth rates after removing the impacts on reported revenues from the changes in the number of billing days and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company provides this data because it focuses on the Company's revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The impacts from the changes in billing days and foreign currency exchange rates are calculated as follows:Billing days impact is calculated by dividing each comparative period's reported revenues by the number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based on the per billing day amounts. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon inputs from all countries and all functional specializations and segments.Foreign currency impact is calculated by retranslating current period international revenues, using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year's comparable period.The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN (UNAUDITED):(in thousands)Quarter Ended December 31,RelationshipsYear Ended December 31,RelationshipsAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs Adjusted2022202120222021202220212022202120222021202220212022202120222021Gross MarginContract talent solutions$  427,736$  444,295$  427,736$  444,29539.9 %39.8 %39.9 %39.8 %$ 1,804,029$ 1,598,716$ 1,804,029$ 1,598,71639.8 %39.6 %39.8 %39.6 %Permanent placement talent solutions155,559157,862155,559157,86299.8 %99.8 %99.8 %99.8 %723,706568,983723,706568,98399.8 %99.8 %99.8 %99.8 %Protiviti135,752141,961139,862145,24427.2 %28.7 %28.0 %29.3 %566,314528,329552,465537,17628.6 %28.5 %27.9 %29.0 %Total$  719,047$  744,118$  723,157$  747,40141.6 %42.0 %41.9 %42.2 %$ 3,094,049$ 2,696,028$ 3,080,200$ 2,704,87542.7 %41.7 %42.6 %41.9 %The following tables provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin to reported gross margin for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:Quarter Ended December 31, 2022Quarter Ended December 31, 2021Contract talentsolutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsProtivitiTotalContract talentsolutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsProtivitiTotal$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue]"

As the name suggests, these publicly traded securities offer regular passive income payouts with dividends (typically on a quarterly basis). Fundamentally, this financial category enables market participants to have their money work for them rather than the other way around.In addition, unlike risk-on growth-oriented enterprises, the price action for shares of passive income providers tends to be more resilient to fluctuations. Of course, this framework prevents truly outstanding upside potential. But in an ecosystem that might turn deflationary because of frequent interest rate hikes, stability commands a premium. With so many variables to account for the in the post-pandemic new normal, it’s wise to own established enterprises.

As well, the company offers various services, including inventory management. Admittedly boring, Fastenal benefits from an established business, providing seemingly mundane equipment for various industrial needs. Thus, it makes an ideal play for best income stocks to buy.Currently, Fastenal enjoys solid financials across the board. For instance, the company’s Altman Z-Score hits 15.23, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. As well, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.68 times, well above the sector median of 0.46 times. Operationally, Fastenal’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) pings at 6.4%, above nearly 62% of its rivals. More impressively, the company’s net margin is 15.7%, ranked better than 96% of sector players.Story continuesFinally, Fastenal carries a forward yield of 2.86%. Combined with its 24 years of consecutive dividend increases, FAST represents one of the best income stocks to buy.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comHealthcare and consumer products stalwart Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) needs no introduction. Though it courted various controversies over the past few years, the brand carries tremendous global recognition. Further, during these difficult times, investors may view JNJ as a reliable canvas. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the best income stocks to buy this month.Mainly, Johnson &amp; Johnson enjoys solid all-around financials.

Before anyone gets any strange ideas, RHI presents significant risks. In the trailing year, shares stumbled over 28%. However, in the year so far, Robert Half gained over 6% of equity value.Fundamentally, it’s possible that RHI may benefit (cynically, I might add) from mass layoffs. While the baseline unemployment rate may be low relative to the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, many companies axed their high-paying jobs. Therefore, if broader economic challenges persist, more folks may take up Robert Half’s employment services.While waiting for this narrative to pan out, investors may enjoy its passive income. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 2.2%. Also, it features a low payout ratio of 28.84%, suggesting that you can depend on this income source.T. Rowe Price (TROW)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased on outside fundamentals, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) arguably represents the riskiest of best income stocks to buy. As a global investment management firm, T. Rowe does well when the markets do well. Unfortunately, that’s not substantively the case at this juncture, hurting the enterprise. In the trailing year, TROW lost over 26% of equity value.Still, some hope endures for T. Rowe. In the year so far, TROW gained 8%. Some of this upside may be due to the underlying company’s relevance. Essentially, T. Rowe hires some of the brightest (and certified) financial advisors in the game. If anybody can navigate the uncertainties of this market environment, it would be these folks.For those that are interested, T. Rowe also offers the highest payout on this list of best income stocks to buy. Currently, its forward yield stands at 4.07%. As well, the company enjoys 37 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Annual total shareholder return guidance is calculated in part based on forward estimates of cumulative annual growth in net operating earnings available to common shareholders, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation G. The company includes this measure because management believes it permits investors to view the company's performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the company's ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be a difference between this measure and its GAAP equivalent due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, the impact of asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results. The company is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis. In addition, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance to its GAAP equivalent without unreasonable efforts.CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nisource-increases-common-stock-dividend-and-declares-preferred-stock-dividend-301731848.htmlSOURCE NiSource Inc.]"

ZBH is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 3, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.58 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.28%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the consensus estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 6.86%. Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayZimmer Biomet is expected to have witnessed continued recovery in its legacy business in the fourth quarter, despite the choppy market situation amid real macroeconomic challenges. This is expected to have been driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution within the Knee and Hip businesses.However, the company might have faced upheaval in business, thanks to the global inflationary situation in terms of mounting labor and raw material costs, severe staffing shortages and supply issues, which might have impacted ZBH’s bottom line in the fourth quarter.Further, Zimmer Biomet, which has a broad business base in China, is expected to have come under pressure due to the lingering COVID-led lockdowns and limited trade through the months of the fourth quarter. Further, the implementation of the volume-based procurement program brought down China’s orthopedic device prices, which might have otherwise impacted ZBH’s business in this region.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteWe expect the company to have witnessed strength in its performances within its Hips and Knees product portfolio in the United States. Apart from a strong recovery in elective procedures, easy comparisons outside the United States, along with strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for the Persona knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the United States, and ROSA penetration and pull-through are expected to have contributed to the company’s Knees business.Story continuesThe strong performance of the G7 Revision System and Avenir Complete is likely to have continued during the fourth quarter, thus driving the Hip business in Q4. Internationally, strong procedure recovery and easier comps outside the United States are expected to have driven the fourth-quarter Hip business.However, priority areas like the S.E.T. business (comprising Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) reported a decline in salesin Q3, impacted by a tough comparison with 2021. This might have been once again repeated in Q4. Yet, the company expects the pressure around the S.E.T. business to ease in Q4, thereby contributing to the top line. Zimmer Biomet is also likely to have gained from the September launch of the Identity shoulder system in the United States.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, suggesting a 13.8% decline from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.83 indicates a 6.2% decline from the year-ago adjusted earnings.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

This compares to earnings of $1.47 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of medical products for respiratory disorders would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.ResMed , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $1.03 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $894.9 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.ResMed shares have added about 11.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for ResMed?While ResMed has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for ResMed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.60 on $999.72 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.44 on $3.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Medtronic (MDT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 21.This medical device company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Medtronic's revenues are expected to be $7.5 billion, down 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Discussion of Second Quarter ResultsAll comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise notedRevenue grew by 20 percent on a constant currency basis, driven by increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as reduced competitive supply.Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, excluding Software-as-a-Service, grew by 26 percent, primarily due to the factors discussed above and recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by COVID-19.Revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets grew by 8 percent on a constant currency basis.Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 18 percent, due to our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN and continued growth in our Home Medical Equipment vertical.Gross margin decreased by 30 basis points and non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 80 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable product mix and foreign currency movements, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 20 percent on a constant currency basis. SG&amp;A expenses improved to 20.5 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with 20.7 percent in the same period of the prior year. These changes in SG&amp;A expenses were mainly due to increases in employee-related expenses and increases in travel expenses.Income from operations increased by 13 percent and non-GAAP income from operations increased by 14 percent.Net income for the quarter was $224.9 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.53. Non-GAAP net income increased by 13% to $244.4 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 13% to $1.66, predominantly attributable to strong sales, partially offset by higher operating expenses.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $128.6 million, reflecting the impact of increases in working capital. During the quarter we paid $64.5 million in dividends.Other Business and Operational HighlightsCompleted the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, a German leader in software solutions for out-of-hospital care providers. Similar to the solutions of ResMed’s leading U.S. SaaS brands, Brightree and MatrixCare, MEDIFOX DAN expands ResMed’s out-of-hospital SaaS business into new health sectors and builds on its established healthcare business in Germany.Celebrated the grand opening of ResMed’s new Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Tuas, Singapore. The 270,000-square-foot (25,000-square-meter) facility more than doubles the size of ResMed’s footprint in Singapore and serves as ResMed’s key manufacturing hub in Asia-Pacific. The facility has the manufacturing capacity and footprint to scale production for connected devices and mask systems to help people sleep, breathe, and live better lives.Dividend programThe ResMed board of directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share.

ResMed uses non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. ResMed believes this information provides investors better insight when evaluating ResMed’s performance from core operations and provides consistent financial reporting. The use of non-GAAP measures is intended to supplement, and not to replace, the presentation of net income and other GAAP measures. Like all non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP earnings are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP.Revenue by Product and Region(Unaudited; $ in millions, except for per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31,2022(A)December 31,2021(A)% Change ConstantCurrency(B)U.S., Canada, and Latin America       Devices$345.5  $244.8   41%  Masks and other 269.7   242.0   11   Total U.S., Canada and Latin America$615.3  $486.8   26           Combined Europe, Asia, and other markets       Devices$197.3  $207.7   (5)%  5%Masks and other 104.4   101.3   3   14 Total Combined Europe, Asia and other markets$301.7  $309.0   (2)  8         Global revenue       Total Devices$542.8  $452.5   20%  25%Total Masks and other 374.2   343.3   9   13 Total Sleep and Respiratory Care$917.0  $795.8   15   20         Software-as-a-Service 116.8   99.0   18   Total$1,033.7  $894.9   16   20          Six Months Ended December 31,2022(A)December 31,2021(A)%Change ConstantCurrency(B)U.S., Canada, and Latin America       Devices$685.1  $520.7   32%  Masks and other 508.3   457.1   11   Total U.S., Canada and Latin America$1,193.4  $977.8   22           Combined Europe, Asia, and other markets       Devices$375.3  $426.0   (12)%  (2)%Masks and other 192.8   198.5   (3)  9 Total Combined Europe, Asia and other markets$568.1  $624.5   (9)  2         Global revenue       Total Devices$1,060.4  $946.7   12%  17%Total Masks and other 701.0   655.7   7   11 Total Sleep and Respiratory Care$1,761.4  $1,602.3   10   14         Software-as-a-Service 222.6   196.6   13   Total$1,984.0  $1,798.9   10   14 (A)Totals and subtotals may not add due to rounding.  (B)In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis,” which is in addition to the actual financial information presented.

Mr. Farrell succeeds current chair Peter Farrell who will become chair emeritus and will remain an active board member.Mick Farrell became ResMed’s CEO on March 1, 2013, and has served as a member of the company’s board of directors since assuming that role.“I am honored to expand my role with ResMed as its next chair and to succeed my dad, Peter Farrell, whose vision, leadership, and guidance have helped ResMed become the largest outside-hospital, digital health company in the world,” said Mick Farrell. “I look forward to working with and leading our strong, diverse, and talented board in continued value creation for stockholders and all our stakeholders.”“I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to lead ResMed and its board over the past many years,” said Peter Farrell. “ResMed is on a clear growth path with strategic priorities intact; it’s the right time for me to step aside and reduce my commitments as chair so I can devote more time to other boards and philanthropic interests. I will remain an active ResMed board member as chair emeritus and will continue to work closely with Mick, ResMed management, and the board as a steward of ResMed’s strategy, innovation, and culture.”“I’d like to thank Peter for his leadership and many contributions to ResMed over the years,” said Ron Taylor, ResMed’s lead independent director and chair of the nominating and governance committee. “We’re pleased to welcome Mick to the board chair position. Over the past 10 years, the board and I have worked closely with and observed Mick in his role as director and as CEO. Under Mick’s leadership of ResMed these last 10 years, we have seen the market capitalization of the company grow from $6 billion to over $30 billion, delivering a total shareholder return of 507% or 20.0% average annual growth in value over that same period; an excellent return for all our stakeholders. We believe Mick has the right skills and experience, and he has been effective in setting the board agenda, encouraging debate, and connecting the board with management for many years. Combining the chair and CEO roles will allow for streamlining and efficiency and is aligned with the structure held by many of our peers on the S&amp;P 500.1 I look forward to working with Mick and the rest of the board as we support the company in reaching its goal of changing the lives of 250 million people in 2025.”Story continues1 Over 40% of the S&amp;P 500 companies combine the chair and CEO roles, including 11 of the 14 other healthcare equipment companies in the S&amp;P 500.About ResMedAt ResMed (NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD) we pioneer innovative solutions that treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives.

The company’s comparable average ticket improved 7%, while the comparable average transaction count rose 2.3%. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, also contributed to comps growth.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 7.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost and MarginsThe gross profit rose 21.7% year over year to $1,363.6 million, while the gross margin expanded 28 basis points (bps) to 34%. Pricing efforts and other initiatives to drive margins partly offset cost inflation, higher transportation costs and the unfavorable product mix.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 14 bps to 25.1%. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 21.4% year over year to $909.6 million.Story continuesHigher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from the impact of elevated transaction expenses, and early integration costs related to the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition. Investments in strategic efforts, and team member compensation and benefits also contributed to higher SG&amp;A expenses, partly offset by reduced COVID-19 response costs, and leverage in occupancy and other costs.The operating income advanced 22.6% year over year to $359.2 million in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the operating margin expanded 14 bps to 8.97%. The impacts of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition were relatively neutral to operating income in the fourth quarter, which reduced the operating margin rate by 20 bps.Financial PositionTractor Supply ended 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $202.5 million, long-term debt of $1,164.1 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $2,042.4 million.In 2022, the company incurred a capital expenditure of $773.4 million and generated a cash flow from operating activities of $1,357 million.

463,9b1d1614-bccd-3a66-9b3b-d76fbd6e6d26,MDLZ,2023-01-27,2 Stocks to Consider Buying Before Earnings Next Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-consider-buying-earnings-005412551.html,1674780852,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Several top-rated stocks are set to report earnings next week from a variety of different sectors and investors may want to consider buying them beforehand.Here are two stocks to keep an eye on before their Q4 reports next week that can also help diversify the portfolio. Mondelez International MDLZInvestors will want to keep an eye on Mondelez International (MDLZ) which is set to report Q4 earnings on January 31.Mondelez International’s Food-Miscellaneous Industry is currently in the top 24% of over 250 Zacks Industries. The provider of chocolates, cookies, gum, and candy among other snacks has seen earnings estimates rise for its current fiscal year 2022 and FY23.In correlation with such, MDLZ stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) going into its fourth-quarter release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Mondelez’s fourth-quarter earnings estimates of $0.71 a share is on par with Q4 2021. This would round out Mondelez International’s fiscal 2022 EPS at $2.94, up 2% from FY21.Sales for Q4 are projected at $8.37 billion, up 9% from the prior year quarter. Total sales for FY22 would be $31.26 billion, also up 9% from 2021. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction does indicate that Mondelez International could slightly miss on its bottom line during Q4 with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.70 a share and the Zacks Consensus at $0.71 per share. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite the possibility of slightly missing earnings expectations, the rising earnings estimates for FY23 make MDLZ stock look attractive and could perhaps lead to the company raising its guidance for the year. If the company does miss earnings expectations, the possibility of a stronger outlook should still help Mondelez International’s stock rally. However, a slight selloff could make the stock even more attractive for longer-term investors, with MDLZ trading at 20.9X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 26.2X and slightly beneath the median of 21.2X.Story continuesRenaissanceRe Holdings RNRAlso reporting on January 31 is RenaissanceRe Holdings. RenaissanceRe is a provider of property-catastrophe reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers globally and is part of the Finance sector.Renaissance also provides specialty reinsurance on accident, health, aviation, and satellite concerns, along with homeowner’s insurance in various parts of the U.S.Renaissance stock lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimate revisions trending higher again for fiscal 2022 and rising for FY23 as well. Even better, fourth-quarter earnings estimates have climbed 73% over the quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Renaissance stock is standing out at the moment as earnings are now expected to be $6.58 a share for Q4 which would be 40% leap from Q4 2021 EPS of $4.71 per share. This would round out fiscal year 2022 with EPS of $6.41 an outstanding 272% increase from $1.72 a share in FY21 which also shows the insurace giant is on a path to a post-pandemic recovery. On the top line, sales are expected at $1.82 billion up 27% from the prior year quarter. Total sales for FY22 would be $6.88 billion, 25% YoY growth with sales at $5.53 billion in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: With the Most Accurate Consensus also at $6.58 per share Renaissance is expected to reach its Q4 expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: With earnings estimate revisions significantly trending higher for Q4 over the last 90 days, RNR is definitely a stock to keep an eye on.While there is no earnings surprise expected it would not be shocking if the company were able to top expectations considering the immense climb in Q4 estimates and an earnings beat could lead to higher highs for RNR stock. Bottom LineBoth Mondelez International and RenassanceRe Holdings stock look intriguing going into their Q4 reports next week as rising earnings estimate revisions for FY23 are a good sign that these companies could offer positive guidance.This may be able to support their stocks even if Q4 earnings come up short. However, If they can beat expectations and also provide a better-than-expected outlook there could certainly be more upside in MDLZ and RNR stock.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MDLZ is likely to register a top-line increase from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 31. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $8,332 million, suggesting a rise of 8.8% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable in the past 30 days at 71 cents per share. This figure remains in line with the year-earlier quarter.The snack food and beverage product company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.4%, on average. MDLZ delivered an earnings surprise of 8.8% in the last reported quarter.Factors to ConsiderMondelez has been gaining from strength in emerging markets and its focus on strengthening the snacking category. The company has been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions. Contributions from the buyouts of Clif Bar (August 2022) and Chipita S.A. (January 2022) are likely to aid Mondelez’s fourth-quarter sales results.The company has been expanding its snacking category in particular. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.However, Mondelez has been battling cost inflation, especially for energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. The company is also navigating through supply-chain bottlenecks.  Volatile currency movements are also an area of concern.On its third-quarter 2022 earnings call, management stated that currency movements are likely to negatively impact net revenues by nearly 6.4% and adjusted EPS by 26 cents in 2022. These headwinds might have hurt the company’s earnings results in the quarter to be reported.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mondelez this time around.

468,7baedc39-0167-3828-94f1-2d36ecc9bdea,BSX,2023-01-27,Earnings Preview: SurModics (SRDX) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-surmodics-srdx-q1-150103012.html,1674745263,STORY,"['SRDX', 'BSX']","[The market expects SurModics (SRDX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drug delivery technology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -392.3%.Revenues are expected to be $24.19 million, up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for SurModics?For SurModics, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that SurModics will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that SurModics would post a loss of $0.38 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.26, delivering a surprise of +31.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.SurModics doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Boston Scientific (BSX) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.23 billion, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Boston Scientific has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 3.19%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Boston Scientific will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Maybe you are working toward a long-term savings goal, like a down payment on a house or your child’s education. Or perhaps you don’t have the risk tolerance to stomach stock market volatility.See the List: GOBankingRates’ Best Banks of 2023More: GOBankingRates’ Best Neobanks of 2023Find: GOBankingRates’ Best Online Banks of 2023Reasons for stashing money away will vary, but the objective is the same: you need a bank that incentivizes long-term deposits. In reality, most banks encourage long-term deposits because those provide them with financial stability. However, some banks like to sweeten the deal for customers a little more than others.Those banks will be our focus. They tend to provide higher rates on savings, especially on longer-term savings products like certificates of deposit (CDs). Here are the five best banks for long-term deposits.CIT BankCIT Bank is a division of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. As an online-only bank, CIT is known for having some of the highest rates in the industry. Currently, its 18-month CD has a rate of 4.75%. That’s an excellent rate for a CD, especially for one with a term of only 18 months.That may sound like a long time, but CDs typically have terms lasting up to 60 months. If you want a shorter term, the APY on its 13-month CD is only slightly lower at 4.65%.Alternatively, if you are looking for very short-term savings, CIT has a high-yield savings account with an APY of 4.05%. However, you do need a minimum deposit of $100 to open a high-yield savings account with CIT.BMOBMO Harris Bank, N.A., also known as just BMO, mainly serves the Midwest. However, it also has branches in Arizona, California and Florida. BMO is a solid choice for long-term deposits thanks to its stellar rates on CDs. It currently offers a 4.50% APY when you open a 59-month CD. Its 13-month CD currently has a 4.00% APY. BMO also has a high-yield savings account with the same 4.00% APY.Story continuesHowever, an important caveat to BMO’s great rates is that they are only available in states where the bank doesn’t have physical branches. If you have a BMO branch down the street, your rates will be unimpressive: 0.25% for a 60-month CD and 1.00% for high-yield savings.Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsSallie MaeSallie Mae was established in the 1970s as a student loan servicer, and you might still think of it as a student loan company. However, Sallie Mae has significantly expanded its portfolio since the 1970s to include a variety of products, including savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts. Currently, all three of these products from Sallie Mae have competitive interest rates.Like the other banks on this list, the highest APY from Sallie Mae is on its CDs, with a 4.40% APY on 24-month and 36-month terms. The APYs on its 6-month and 12-month CDs aren’t bad either, at 3.50% and 4.25%, respectively. Meanwhile, its high-yield savings account has a 3.20% APY, and its money market account has a 3.40% APY.Capital OneCapital One is a well-known bank with a variety of products, including checking accounts, credit cards, savings accounts and CDs. While the best rates on savings products are often limited to lesser-known banks, Capital One is one of the exceptions. In fact, its CDs and savings accounts have rates among the best you’ll find anywhere.Currently, Capital One has APYs of up to 4.40% on its CDs, but to claim that rate you’ll have to lock in a 60-month term. However, even Capital One’s 12-month CD has a 4.15% APY. For 6-month and 9-month CDs, the APY is 3.30%. That rate of 3.30% matches the APY you get on Capital One’s high-yield savings accounts.Bask BankBask Bank is a relatively new name in the banking world, as it was established as a division of Texas Capital Bank in January 2020. Although Bask isn’t a household name at this point, the bank is a member FDIC, so you know your money is safe.Currently, it doesn’t offer a checking account but has high-yield savings accounts and CDs. It also has a savings account that earns two American Airlines AAdvantage miles for every $1 in your account annually.Bask is a great place to keep your money for the long term, thanks to its great CD rates. It offers a 4.45% 12-month CD and a 4.30% 6-month CD — these are the bank’s highest rates for CDs. If you prefer to keep your money in a high-yield savings account, Bask currently has an APY of 4.15%.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Best Banks for Long-Term Deposits]"

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €1.74b€1.83b€1.92b€1.98b€2.03b€2.06b€2.08b€2.10b€2.12b€2.13bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x1Est @ 3.10%Est @ 2.22%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.18%Est @ 0.88%Est @ 0.67%Est @ 0.52% Present Value (€, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% €1.6k€1.6k€1.6k€1.5k€1.5k€1.4k€1.4k€1.3k€1.2k€1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €14bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 0.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €2.1b× (1 + 0.2%) ÷ (6.4%– 0.2%) = €34bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €34b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= €18bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is €33b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of €51.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.907. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific PartnersStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the Dutch market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the Dutch market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

This compares to earnings of $0.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 33.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this timber and paper products company would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.42, delivering a surprise of 2.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Weyerhaeuser , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Wood industry, posted revenues of $1.82 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.21%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.21 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Weyerhaeuser shares have added about 5.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Weyerhaeuser?While Weyerhaeuser has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Weyerhaeuser: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

This category includes patents for laundry appliances, and was driven by female engineers from Whirlpool Corp.Sr. Mgr. and Cooking Performance Subsystem Leader Michele Paustian has been with Whirlpool Corp. for nearly 20 years, joining after college graduation. She started with a lab internship right out of high school. She has patents in laundry and now works in the cooking category. When asked which patent she is most proud of, she recalls one for clothes dryers.""It's an improved temperature control capability for dryers that I worked on as an intern, so it was pretty exciting,"" she says. ""I had my very first patent filed during my first year at Whirlpool, and to have that one actually go to production on millions of units feels really good.""When she was younger, Paustian says that there wasn't as much exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers. ""My own exposure was that my dad was an engineer, so I knew what he did, and I knew it was something that I could do with my interest in math and science.""""I would say any way that young people can get into activities like robotics or anything that involves building or thinking through the composition of things; how they're made, how they're comprised of smaller elements-that's the basis of engineering that really got me interested in it as a kid-doing things like that with my dad. I'd tell anyone who is interested in engineering to get in there and get your hands dirty and see if you like it.""Binglai Chen, who has been with Whirlpool Corp. for 21 years, has a patent in under counter ice maker design. She currently works as the Director of Planning for Electronic Engineering Systems Information (EESI). A Penn State graduate, she credits her parents with fostering a love of engineering in her.Story continues""It was part of my upbringing,"" she says. ""I grew up in the backyard of Penn State because my father was going through the university for his doctorate. When you're in that environment, you see engineering at work and you see that they're talking about how to make the world better. One of the things that not only my parents instilled in me, but teachers did as well, is that an engineering degree teaches you how to learn.""Chen says that if you poll just about any group of engineers asking why they wanted to go into the field, they will say that they want to be ""problem solvers.""Product Development Director Colleen Doyle leads cooking innovation and cooking advanced development for Whirlpool Corporation. She previously worked in laundry, where she has multiple patents surrounding bulk detergent dispensing and other solutions to help with the laundry process. Doyle feels that women can bring a different perspective to product development and design.""I've learned through experience how much more value there is to having diversity on a team, with people who have a little bit of a different approach and a different way of seeing the same problem."" She agrees that engineers are essentially at their core, problem solvers.""I always liked math and solving problems. When I was a kid, I used to bring logic problems on road trips and I would do those in the car."" She was torn between a career in engineering and one in the medical field for a while.""That question went away the first time I had a project I was really excited about and felt was really going to make a difference in a consumer's life,"" says Doyle. ""Right then is when I knew I was in the right place.""Director of Product Design Jessica McConnell is well known around Whirlpool Corp. for her patents in Color, Materials and Finish (CMF). She says that her first patent was for a unique interior color for a KitchenAid brand refrigerator. She has several patents in refrigeration, but is also known for her colors and finishes for the iconic KitchenAid stand mixer.""Anything that we've done with the stand mixer to innovate from a materials perspective or even the different bowls-we're taking a product that is over 100 years old and continuing to innovate it. Even simple innovations like these can be very impactful.""Perhaps her most memorable patent was the JennAir Obsidian refrigerator interior she designed. ""That's probably one of the things that I will always be proud of. It's also something that's in the process of being trademarked for the brand, which is the next step beyond a patent. It's really special when it's not just a patented technology and it also becomes a distinctive brand asset.""Her advice for young engineers is: ""If you have an idea or if you believe you can do something, go for it. There's nothing wrong with tinkering or sharing that idea that you have with others and trying to build it in some form or fashion, whether it's sketching it or prototyping it or 3D printing it.

Now, don’t misinterpret what I’m trying to say: it’s not that you should avoid growth-oriented names altogether. Rather, it’s a prudent idea to pivot your portfolio to a balanced profile. That way, you can accommodate any variability to your market thesis.While no one can say with absolute authority what will happen in 2023, investors should stay on their guard. For one thing, you have a massive geopolitical conflict in Europe that may not be resolved anytime soon. Further, the Federal Reserve still has much work to do to clamp down on excess liquidity. It’s not out of the realm of possibility, then, to see deflationary pressures.Speaking of deflation, eroding economic sentiment contributed to mass layoffs. Having to digest multiple market catalysts, investors should focus on the best dividend stocks to buy for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co$66.86AEPAmerican Electric Power$92.66PSXPhillips 66$106.94WHRWhirlpool$152.12HRBH&amp;R Block$38.50TSNTyson Foods$66.15KHCKraft Heinz$40.26Southern Co (SO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding company, Southern Co (NYSE:SO) commands extraordinary relevance because of its footprint. According to its public profile, Southern is the second largest utility company in the U.S. in terms of customer base, as of 2021. Although it’s a vital component of the economy, SO didn’t get much love these days. In the trailing year, shares slipped a bit under parity.Nevertheless, this circumstance may change for the better because of Southern’s migration-related advantage. Situated in the southern portion of the U.S. (hence its name), it commands a huge coverage map in Georgia. This is significant because Georgia represents one of the states that millennials are moving to. In particular, young folks have streamed into Atlanta.Story continuesAs a passive income provider, Southern offers a very attractive profile. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 4.05%. This ranks a bit higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, Southern features 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, making it an attractive candidate for best dividend stocks to buy.American Electric Power (AEP)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA major investor-owned electric utility, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. Like Southern Co above, American Electric benefits from millennial migration trends. Featuring a coverage map that includes much of the Midwest and eastern states, AEP enjoys a clear advantage.With costs of living skyrocketing in major metropolitan areas, young folks have found refuge in relatively more rural areas. For instance, Virginia – where AEP features a strong presence – offers an attractive alternative to pricey regions. Stated differently, American Electric conducts business where the money will be, not necessarily where it is right now.Just as well, the company provides a solid dividend with a forward yield of 3.6%. Also, it features 13 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Admittedly, its payout ratio of 58.78% is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, it’s within a reasonable level as to not spark alarm bells. Finally, Wall Street analysts love AEP, rating it a consensus strong buy. Thus, it makes a great case for best dividend stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the industry’s value chain. This component covers operations like refining and marketing, as opposed to upstream (exploration and production) and midstream (storage and transportation). Fundamentally, as society reaches full normalization, PSX may skyrocket. Indeed, in the trailing year, it’s already up over 29%.But prospective investors shouldn’t be discouraged. As companies start recalling their workers back to the office, traffic volume will surely increase. For instance, Disney (NYSE:DIS) generated headlines recently when CEO Bob Iger basically put an end to remote operations. While some intrepid workers may go independent and join the gig economy, I’m sure most will fall in line.And with that, you’re talking about a high-probability fundamental catalyst. From this angle alone, PSX ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy. Still, as a bonus, the company carries a forward yield of 3.63%. And a relatively low payout ratio of 31% presents little concern about sustainability.Whirlpool (WHR)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockAn oddity among the best dividend stocks to buy, I genuinely believe investors should watch Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) closely this year. Let me be the first to say that appliance manufacturers represent a boring component of the economy. As well, WHR hasn’t exactly been a friend to long-term stakeholders. In the trailing year, shares slipped over 27%. And in the trailing five years, they’re down 19%.So, what gives? As you know, anything mechanical eventually breaks down. Further, the complexities involved in modern appliances and equipment make (in some cases) out-of-warranty repairs financially non-sensical. Plus, if an appliance breaks down, you tend to want a new one.Now, during the first three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the work-from-home pivot likely accelerated home appliance usage (as opposed to in-office appliances). Therefore, the extra, unplanned usage may accelerate the underlying appliances’ breakdown period.Cynically, then, Whirlpool enjoys upside potential. While you’re waiting for this thesis to pan out, the company offers a forward yield of 4.64%. It’s strange but WHR could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that aligns strongly with the gig economy, H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy. At the very least, you should monitor its progress this year. Granted, its core tax consultancy business doesn’t signal a particularly exciting business. However, it’s going to be among the most relevant, depending on how serious workers want to consider the gig economy.Already, we’re seeing reports globally about people quitting rather than going back to the office. In that case (in the U.S.), gig workers must then transition from filing W-2 forms with the IRS and move to the (dreaded) 1099. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to go over all the differences. However, the key point centers on disclosures. With 1099 forms, you must make more of them.Further, because gig workers report their earnings and legal deductions, mistakes may trigger an IRS action. Therefore, it’s vital that these independent contractors know what they’re doing. H&amp;R Block can help. Plus, the company offers a forward yield of 3.10%.Tyson Foods (TSN)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) represents a vital category in the economy, it hasn’t had a great performance in 2022. Indeed, in the trailing year, TSN gave up nearly 29% of equity value. It’s not just related to technical rumblings. Fundamentally, investors lost confidence in Tyson because of growing margin pressure and operational issues.From this basis, Tyson represents one of the riskier names among the best dividend stocks to buy. At the same time, it’s difficult to be overly negative on food-related enterprises. Unlike companies in the consumer discretionary space, no trade down (cheaper alternative) exists for food. You’re either eating or you’re not.Financially, the troubles did make TSN more attractive. Currently, the company sports a decently stable balance sheet and solid profitability. Better yet, the market prices TSN at 9.65-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 16 times.Finally, Tyson carries a forward yield of just under 3%. Also, it features 11 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Thus, it’s a solid contrarian candidate for best dividend stocks to buy.Kraft Heinz (KHC)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) presents an intriguing narrative for the best dividend stocks to buy. Primarily, it features a generous rate of passive income. At the same time, KHC has been a proven winner. You’re probably not going to get rich off the shares. However, I’ll take a trailing-year performance of 9.6% any time, particularly when the benchmark equities index slipped sharply.Fundamentally, investors should pay close attention to KHC because of the trade-down effect. Assuming economic conditions worsen from here, consumers will start cutting unnecessary expenses and seeking cheaper alternatives to desired products/services. However, you can’t trade down from making your own food at home. Therefore, Kraft Heinz’s core grocery products-related business should blossom.While investors wait for this plotline to pan out, they can collect some sweet passive income. Currently, Kraft Heinz carries a forward yield of 4%. And while its payout ratio at 55.24% is somewhat elevated, it’s arguably not going to cause serious concern. Thus, KHC ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

501,bc71b851-a132-3d55-bb01-de83cd3dc2b5,IR,2023-01-27,Trane Technologies (TT) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trane-technologies-tt-reports-next-150103136.html,1674745263,STORY,['TT'],"[The market expects Trane Technologies (TT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.95 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Trane Technologies?For Trane Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.09%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Trane Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Trane Technologies would post earnings of $2.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.27, delivering a surprise of +7.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Trane Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.On the positive side, Comcast should continue to benefit from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the third quarter. Broadband user base increased in the last reported quarter on October 27th (the company is scheduled to report Q4 results on Thursday, January 26th). Comcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability.

It prioritizes improving its business operating system and innovation through business transformation initiatives and prudent investments.Trane has a track record of repurchasing shares and paying dividends consistently. Such moves instil investor confidence and positively impact the company's bottom line.However, product and service diversity put's Trane in the face of fierce competition in terms of price, quantity, delivery, service, support, technology and innovation.

My name is Liz and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Steve Winoker: Thanks, Liz. Welcome to GE's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I am joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe. Keep in mind that some of the statements we are making are forward-looking and based in our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. As a reminder, GE completed the separation of our healthcare business this month. GE Healthcare will report separately on January 30. So while included in our 2022 results, we are focusing today's commentary primarily on GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, our portfolio of energy businesses. Our remarks will also be simpler and shorter today, reflecting the company we are now and we will move more quickly to Q&amp;A. I will now hand the call over to Larry.Larry Culp: Steve, thank you and good morning everyone. 2022 marked the beginning of a new era for GE, following 4 years of strategic and operational transformation. We successfully separated GE Healthcare in a spin-off, distributing approximately 80% to GE shareholders on January 3. We strengthened our foundation, retiring an additional $11 billion of debt, bringing our total debt reduction over $100 billion since 2018. We continue to improve our operations, further embedding lean and decentralization to better serve our customers. And today, excluding GE Healthcare Services, which are both higher margin and more resilient, represented even larger part of our portfolio about 60% of revenues and 85% of our backlog. We finished the year strong, delivering revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation.Story continuesGE Aerospace led the way as we executed on an unprecedented ramp. Within GE Vernova, power delivered with continued stability at gas and we took significant actions to position renewable energy for future profitability. External catalysts like U.S. climate legislation and the European focus on accelerating electrification are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies. This progress has positioned us to create industry leading investment-grade independent public companies. Thanks to our team's high-quality work, our plans to launch GE Vernova and GE Aerospace are progressing well. We are filling key leadership positions for both and we are preparing for two standalone businesses. We will share more details with you, including our ongoing progress and timeline for the planned GE Vernova spin at our investor conference in March.I could not be more proud of how the GE team managed through a challenging external environment to deliver for our customers and partners in 2022, my thanks to everyone. And before I turn the call over to Carolina, a moment of reflection. Just two weeks ago, I, along with many of our leadership team attended a memorial service for our exemplary GE Board member and former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter. Ash was a remarkable leader, incredibly humble and clear headed. We miss him and his stage counsel. Now, Carolina will take you through our results.Carolina Dybeck Happe: Thanks, Larry. Turning to Slide 3, I will speak to the key drivers of our performance. I will do it on an organic basis and including GE Healthcare. In the fourth quarter, top line momentum continued as orders grew significantly across all segments. Revenue was up 11%, with services up 13%. By segment, revenue at Aerospace, Power and Healthcare was up double-digits, driven by market demand, price realization and improving delivery. This was partially offset by renewables largely due to lower volume resulting from U.S. PTC lapse and our heightened commercial selectivity. Adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points. Power was particularly robust, offsetting renewables. Overall, our price and cost-out actions outpaced inflation.Revenue and profit growth resulted in over 50% EPS growth. Free cash flow was $4.3 billion, primarily driven by strong earnings and improving working capital. All accounts were a source of cash, except receivables, which as expected, was a use from revenue growth. Moving to the full year, orders were up 7%, with 22% growth in Aerospace and 13% growth in Power. Total services orders were up 12% supporting profitable growth in 2023. Revenue was up 6%, largely driven again by Aerospace, up 23%. More broadly, higher margin services were up double-digits, while total equipment revenue decreased 4%. Collectively, supply chain headwinds and macro pressures impacted our performance by about 4 points. Importantly, margins, EPS and free cash flow, all significantly improved year-over-year and finished in line or above the most recent outlook we shared in October.Adjusted margin expanded 160 basis points led by Aerospace and Power. Robust services growth, pricing has almost $1.5 billion of cost out actions drove improvement. This was partially offset by inflationary pressures especially at our shorter cycle businesses and pressure from renewables. Operating profit growth and debt reduction drove EPS up more than 50% for the full year. Free cash flow was $4.8 billion, up over $2 billion or over 80% improvement, driven by earnings and reduced debt. In 2022, working capital was a source of cash as accounts payable, progress collections and contract assets all contributed to the solid performance. Now, a moment on corporate. In 2021, we ended the year with $1.2 billion of costs. We continued to reduce cost in 2022, including a few hundred million dollars of market-driven favorability.We now have a smaller, linear cost structure. And in 2023, we expect costs of about $600 million or roughly half of the 2021 sales line. Free cash flow, we expect to improve significantly given our progress with debt reduction and lower costs. We continue to execute our restructuring plans and reduce our cost structure post the healthcare spin, setting up fit-for-purpose, standalone structures for GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Stepping back, we are encouraged by our improved volume and pricing and our significant cost-out actions exiting the quarter. This will help us drive continued growth in 2023. Now back to you, Larry, to discuss our businesses.Larry Culp: Carolina, thank you. Starting with Aerospace, I am 6 months in leading this business and my conviction is even higher today that we have a premier franchise with highly differentiated product and technology positions and leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors. Entering 2022, our priority was delivering on the significant growth across both engines and services, where stability and predictability are critically important for our customers. This starts with the right team. We have a balance of unparalleled experience and fresh perspective with nearly half our leaders new to their roles this year. We are also driving two major operational changes. First is accelerating our progress with Lean to improve operating rigor and delivery.Take supply chain, where we have seen real improvements with more to come. Our team in Terre Haute produces lead turbine center frames and started 22 with about 50 pieces delinquent. Working through multiple kaizens, implementing flows, standard work and daily management, the team's Lean actions increased output over 20% and improved productivity by about 10%. And today, they are on schedule. With our 2023 demand, we will need to continue to use Lean in this way to deliver for our customers. The second is decentralization. For example, in our commercial engines business, we are increasingly running our product lines as their own P&amp;Ls, in line with how our customers work with us, more cross-functional collaboration in real time closer to the customer helps make us better.Turning to the quarter, both orders and revenue were up over 20%. Equipment orders were robust, now with almost 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. Commercial services and equipment revenue grew about 30% and military revenue was up about 20%. And services internal shop visits were up 25% and external part sales were up more than 20%. In equipment, commercial units were up nearly 30% with LEAP units, up almost 50%. Looking sequentially, both internal shop visits and commercial units were about flat, but military units were up 10%. While material availability continues to be a challenge, our output across engines and services, we are using our Lean tools to help accelerate sequential improvement, a key for us this year. Fourth quarter margins were above 18%, slightly better than we expected, although down year-over-year.Photo by Alexandre Debiève on UnsplashHigher volume and price were more than offset by negative mix driven by increased commercial equipment shipments, continued investment to support the business growth and other cost pressures. While still net price cost positive, we expect inflation will continue to be challenging in 2023. For the year, revenue was up 23%, driven by commercial sales with internal shop visits up over 20%. Profitability and cash were solid. Margins were 18.3%, up 440 basis points year-over-year. Services growth and positive price costs more than offset the impact of increased investments and negative engine mix from higher LEAP deliveries. Free cash flow of $4.9 billion was driven by earnings and working capital. As we shared last quarter, total in-year AD&amp;A flow came in close to zero versus last year, $0.5 billion of pressure.Looking ahead today, GE and CFM departures are close to 90% of 19 levels and we expect to be back to 19 levels later this year. In 23, internal shop visits are expected to grow about 20% and external spare part sales are expected to increase. With commercial engines growing at about 20% and services at high-teens to about 20% plus military growing at a high single-digit rate, we expect total aerospace revenue to be in the mid to high-teens and we expect LEAP engine deliveries to grow about 50% in 23. We also expect to deliver profit of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion and higher free cash flow. Aligned to current airframe or aircraft delivery schedules, AD&amp;A is expected to be about $0.5 billion outflow in 2023. We are laser-focused on supporting our airframers, airlines and lessors as they ramp post pandemic.Today, that means providing stability and predictability for our customers keeping our current fleet flying and growing our new fleet, all the while continuing to invest in technologies that will define the future of flight. Notably, we are encouraged by the momentum at military with our next-generation technology, including the XA100 engine for the F-35. The XA100 offers cutting-edge capabilities needed to ensure continued U.S. air superiority. The Adaptive Engine Transition Program received a strong show of support recently from nearly 50 bipartisan members of Congress who wrote in support of continuing the program, which includes our engine with $286 million of funding included in the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Overall, GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with a bright future as the standalone industry leader.Turning to the GE Vernova portfolio, power delivered a solid performance this year and we are making real progress running a similar strategy at renewables. While the demand dropped due to the PTC lapse significantly impacted our renewables results in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act is a real game changer for us and the industry going forward. In fact, we began to see a rebound in demand this quarter, with renewables orders up 7%. Onshore orders in North America more than doubled a very encouraging sign. But unlocking the full potential of the IRA will hinge on how quickly the administration moves through implementation. Meanwhile, lower volumes and inflationary pressures continue to weigh on our performance. Fourth quarter revenue was down 13% due to onshore and margins contracted as inflation and lower volumes offset pricing and productivity gains.Full year free cash flow declined over $0.5 billion due to lower earnings. So, while we await clarity on the IRA rules, Scott and the team are controlling the controllable, taking action and we saw progress in that regard this quarter. Grid, a business that lost close to $400 million in 2021 was profitable for the first quarter since 2018, reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts. Orders also grew significantly. At onshore, we are executing a restructuring with our headcount decreasing almost 20% sequentially, which will deliver savings in 2023. Our strategic sourcing actions that are onshore and our focus on reducing product variance will improve product costs despite continued inflationary pressures. Across the businesses, orders and sales pricing continue to improve with our selectivity strategy yielding a more profitable backlog and pipeline.Service orders and revenues, excluding repower, grew. There is certainly more work to do and the next 6 months will remain challenging, but we are acting with urgency. In 2023, we expect mid single-digit growth, significantly better profit and flat to improving free cash flow. Taking it by the businesses. Onshore, we expect more than 50% orders growth in North America this year. And based on the orders we have in hand, we are confident of delivering over 2,000 units globally with North American volume more than doubling in the second half versus the first half of the year. We also expect a significant step up in profit driven by lower warranty and related reserves, better price and restructuring benefits. With this significant orders growth comes roughly $3 billion to $4 billion of cash down payments this year.This includes $0.5 billion of cash linked to large tech selects we have won, which we expect to convert to orders later this year. These are strong customer commitments, but given the project size and complexity, timing could shift somewhat across quarters. In offshore, we expect to more than double revenue from about $0.5 billion in 2022. However, our margins on the first tranche of Haliade-X projects will be challenging between typical new product margins and inflation resulting in rising losses. Associated with the delivery growth and limited down payments, we also expect cash will be significantly pressured in 2023 in offshore, mostly a timing dynamic. And at Grid, given our robust orders growth, we expect continued growth. The actions we've taken on price are expected to offset inflation pressures, and we continue to make progress, including our small  our smaller cost structure and productivity.Taken together, this will enable grid to deliver a modestly profitable year in 2023. Overall, I'm confident we're seeing operating improvements throughout the year in renewables and key external catalysts like the IRA will help improve our longer-term economic profile here. Moving to Power. We've significantly improved power is demonstrated by our continued profit and cash growth. We're well positioned for continued services growth with our expanded HA fleet. To date, we've now shipped 110 HAs with roughly 80 units COD, providing a reliable source of cash growth in the future as our highest utilization assets in the fleet. Looking at the quarter, power demand remained robust. Orders grew in all businesses and revenue was up double digits, largely driven by continued aero derivative momentum at Gas Power.Services were also solid with orders and revenue up again driven by gas transactional services. Margins expanded over 700 basis points driven by significant gas volume, favorable price cost and productivity gains. Similar to Aerospace, we expect inflation will remain challenging through 2023. Moving to the full year, orders were up double digits, but importantly, we're not taking our eye off selectivity with disciplined underwriting. In line with our outlook, revenue was up low single digits led by services. Margins expanded 300 basis points, enabling power to achieve high single-digit margin for the year, and our free cash flow improved significantly across both gas and steam. At gas service, billings were strong as fleet utilization grew low single digits.Looking to 2023 for Power, we expect low single-digit revenue growth driven by Gas Power services. Equipment revenue will grow as we deliver more HAs despite the new build wind down at team, and we anticipate year-over-year. At gas, both equipment and services volume as well as productivity gains and price should help offset rising inflation pressure. We expect lower free cash flow year-over-year, continued earnings growth and strong services collections are offset by disbursements, but we expect free cash flow conversion to remain solid. Stepping back, our existing technologies in the GE Vernova portfolio will play an important role in the energy transition. It's the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge these businesses with their vast installed bases were made to meet.Let's turn now to the overall GE outlook for 2023. We're expecting organic revenue growth in the high single-digit range, $1.60 to $2 for adjusted EPS, which includes about $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion of adjusted profit and a range of $3.4 billion to $4.2 billion for free cash flow. Underpinning this outlook is a higher services concentration in our portfolio as well as our confidence in the strength of GE Aerospace is the worldwide commercial aviation industry, airlines and airframers like continues its post-pandemic recovery. We also anticipate military revenue growth, thus yielding significant profit growth for GE Aerospace in 23. For GE Vernova, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth and profit of negative $600 million to negative $200 million, including improvement at both businesses.On cash, we expect flat to slight improvement. This is driven largely by better profitability and planned down payments in onshore where timing could shift across quarters with some offset from offshore increasing deliveries. Across GE, we expect continued operational improvements to deliver higher earnings and improved working capital management. In turn, this will help us drive higher free cash flow for GE in 23. We are looking forward to sharing more during our March 9 Investor Conference at GE Aerospace in Cincinnati by then, hopefully, home of the Super Bowl Champion Bangs, where you'll hear more detail from our leadership teams about both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.

510,9234f1f7-6c37-3f17-a459-5ed0da15ccdd,GE,2023-01-27,Should You Invest in GE (GE) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-ge-ge-based-bullish-143002602.html,1674743402,STORY,['GE'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Electric (GE).GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.72, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.3% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is GE a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 62.1% over the past month to $3.16.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) has a market capitalization of $78.922 billion.Giverny Capital made the following comment about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""At the top of our performance list, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) rose 26% for the year as it generated outstanding results relative to other large auto insurers. Markel and Berkshire Hathaway rose modestly. The three companies compete in diverse lines of insurance, but they all benefit from rising rates for property coverage after an extended period of weather catastrophes, rising jury awards in lawsuits and inflated loss costs. Our insurers tend to be careful underwriters, so their profitability rises with rates. Our insurers also benefit from rising interest rates because they tend to invest premiums paid by customers into fixed income securities until they pay claims.Our largest holding at year-end was Progressive, ascending to the top spot thanks to 26% appreciation in a year when most of our holdings lost value.The auto insurance industry is in turmoil, with most companies losing money as soaring used car prices drive up the cost of accident repairs and replacements. It is hard to overstate Progressive’s superiority to its peer group. It is the most sophisticated underwriter in the country, and it began raising insurance premiums earlier than its peers did as driving patterns and repair costs worsened in 2021. It did other smart things, too, including reducing advertising and sales efforts in markets where it could not get rate increases – thus choosing where it would compete hardest for customers – and not renewing the policies of high-risk drivers. This may seem elementary, but most other major insurers did the opposite: they used the windfall profits earned during pandemic quarantine to ratchet up their marketing efforts to attract new customers.

Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$24.9bUS$26.4bUS$28.2bUS$31.5bUS$34.7bUS$37.1bUS$39.1bUS$40.8bUS$42.3bUS$43.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.85%Est @ 5.39%Est @ 4.37%Est @ 3.65%Est @ 3.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$23.3kUS$23.1kUS$23.1kUS$24.1kUS$24.9kUS$24.9kUS$24.5kUS$24.0kUS$23.2kUS$22.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$238bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$44b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$910bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$910b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$468bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$706b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$492, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.813. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

522,275eb644-e29b-3391-b0ab-2e70079bc134,EL,2023-01-27,Estee Lauder (EL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estee-lauder-el-expected-beat-150103038.html,1674745263,STORY,['EL'],"[Estee Lauder (EL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -57.1%.Revenues are expected to be $4.56 billion, down 17.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.64% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Estee Lauder?For Estee Lauder, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Estee Lauder will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Estee Lauder would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of +6.20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Estee Lauder appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Cosmetics industry, e.l.f. Beauty (ELF), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.23 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -4.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $121.48 million, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for e.l.f. Beauty has been revised 3.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.33%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that e.l.f. Beauty will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, I will turn the call over to Dan Bartok, our CEO.Dan Bartok: Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate your interest in Forestar and taking the time to discuss our first quarter results. In addition to Katie, I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Jim Allen, our Chief Financial Officer and Mark Walker, our Chief Operating Officer. Mortgage rates rose at a record pace during 2022, as a result housing affordability has been severely impacted. New home sales fell 15% in November from a year ago and December housing starts were down 25% from a year ago. Despite those headwinds resulting in a revenue decline of nearly 50%. Our gross profit margin increased 390 basis points to 21.9%, and our pre-tax profit margin was 12.9%. The real story here is the transformation that Forestar has undergone over the past five years.Story continuesWe have become the largest pure play residential lot manufacturing company in the United States. We have built a platform and assembled a team that is flexible and focused. We have further strengthened our balance sheet and look to be opportunistic in ways that will continue to build shareholder value. We have a strategic relationship with D.R. Horton, America's largest builder, and we have positioned ourselves to expand our customer base as we consolidate market share. The housing market is going through a period of transition. We are disciplined and have been proactively reducing land acquisition over the past 18-months. We have been staging development activity at our projects to be prepared for when the plan for residential lots increases.Our flexibility enables us to quickly adjust to meet the needs of our customers. We continue to strive to maximize returns, while we plan and prepare to return to periods of rapid growth. Having a growth plan is one thing, but we have the capital structure, the operational flexibility, a strong customer relationship, and most importantly, the team execute that plan. Forestar is better positioned than ever to serve current and new customers and consolidate market share. Jim will now discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail.Jim Allen: Thank you, Dan. In the first quarter, net income attributable to Forestar was $20.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $40.5 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled $216.7 million, compared to $407.6 million during the first quarter of 2022. We sold 2,263 lots during the quarter with an average sales price of $90,100. We expect continued quarterly fluctuations in our average sales price based on the geographic location and lot size mix of our deliveries. We expect demand for residential lots will continue to be impacted in the coming months as homebuilders align starts to a new sales pace. Our pre-tax income for the quarter totaled $27.9 million, compared to $53.5 million in the first quarter of last year.Our pre-tax profit margin of 12.9% was 20 basis points lower than last year, driven by reduced operating leverage. Our gross profit margin was 21.9%, representing an improvement of 390 basis points over the prior year period. In the first quarter, SG&amp;A expense was $22.9 million or 10.6% as a percentage of revenues, compared to $21.5 million in the prior year quarter. While our SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue was higher than we would like, the absolute dollars were down 3% sequentially and has decreased for the last three quarters. We will continue to focus on controlling our SG&amp;A costs, while ensuring that our infrastructure supports our business. Mark?Mark Walker: As for current market conditions, we are starting to see greater contractor availability with front-end trades and continue to stage development on a project-by-project basis. Despite single family home starts falling, roughly 25% in December from a year ago, our cost to develop a residential lot continued to decline. Materials like Concrete, Cement and Transformers are still challenging to secure. However, our teams are relentless problem solvers and they continue to navigate this environment exceptionally well. We will continue to be proactive and work with our trade partners to develop cost -- control development costs. We evaluate each project and the surrounding market conditions as we determine the appropriate pricing and sales pace to maximize returns.We remain focused on developing lots for homes at affordable price points demonstrated by our average sale price of roughly $90,000. Over the past 12 months, our inventory balance has grown only 5%. Despite elongated development timelines, and inflationary pressures further demonstrating discipline and strategic inventory management. Jim?Photo by Vita Vilcina on UnsplashJim Allen: 7% of our first quarter deliveries were sold to customers other than D.R. Horton, compared to 11% in the prior year quarter. In the trailing 12-months 16% of our deliveries were sold to other customers and we continue to target selling 30% of our lots to customers other than D.R. Horton over the intermediate term. Additionally, Forestar's lots sold to D.R. Horton continue to grow as a percentage of D.R. Horton starts year-over-year and sequentially. Approximately one out of every five homes that D.R. Horton starts is on a lot developed by Forestar. Our mutually stated goal is for one out of every three homes that D.R. Horton sells to be built on a lot developed by us. Katie?Katie Smith: Forestar's underwriting criteria for new development projects including minimum 15% pre-tax return on average inventory and a return of the initial cash investment within 36-months. During the first quarter, we invested $237 million in land and land development, a reduction of 38%, compared to the prior year quarter. $205 million was for land development and $32 million was for land. As land prices continue to increase across most of our footprint during 18-months, we proactively started to reduce our land investment in anticipation of the slower housing market and primarily focus on the phase development of land that we already own. We are working with land sellers to extend closing dates and in certain cases we have opted to terminate contracts.Our unique operating model allows us to adjust the pace of development based on market conditions and we remain intensely focused on managing our development in phases as we strive to deliver finished blocks at a pace that matches market demand consistent with our emphasis on capital efficiency. Mark?Mark Walker: Forestar's loss position as of December 31 was 82,300 lots, of which 61,500 lots are owned and 20,800 are controlled through purchase contracts. Our lot position decreased by 7,800 lots or 9% sequentially and by 21,000 lots or 20% year-over-year. We incurred $2.4 million of option deposits and due diligence write-offs in the quarter. At quarter end, we had 7,600 finished lots on hand. The majority of our owned lots were placed under contract to purchase from land sellers prior to 2021, resulting in an attractive cost basis and we had no inventory impairments during the quarter. We are continuing to target a three to four-year owned inventory of land and lots. 30% of our owned lots are under contract to sell, representing approximately $1.5 billion of future revenue.These contracts of $148 million of hard earnest money deposits associated with them. Another 29% of our owned lots are subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton based off executive purchase and sale agreements. Jim?Jim Allen: We are maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and modest leverage and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach when investing capital to enhance the long-term value of Forestar. We ended the quarter with over $580 million of liquidity, including approximately $215 million of unrestricted cash and $365 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility after the reduction for outstanding letters of credit. Total debt at December 31 was $706 million with no senior note maturities until fiscal 2026. Our net debt to capital ratio at December 31 was 28.7%, down from 33.9% in the prior year period. We ended the year with $1.2 billion of stockholders' equity and our book value per share increased to $24.50, up 15% from a year ago.Forestar's capital structure is one of our biggest competitive advantages. Most traditional land developers are encumbered by project level financing, which makes it more difficult to react to the market, while also adding complexity and administrative costs. Our strong liquidity and corporate level financing enable us to operate effectively through changing economic conditions and positions us to be strategic when attractive opportunities present themselves. We have significant flexibility to navigate the upcoming year. Katie?Katie Smith: Consistent with our last earnings call and as a result of the current market certainties, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2023 at this time. We will reevaluate providing annual guidance when we have sufficient visibility into market conditions. We have been very strategic and disciplined and we are well positioned to adapt quickly to the short-term challenges that are before us and the housing industry. Dan, I will hand it back to you for closing remarks.Dan Bartok: Thank you, Katie. Forestar will continue facing difficult comparisons to our fiscal 2022 results as the housing industry adjusts throughout 2023. We have made remarkable progress building Forestar's platform, which enabled us to maintain strong returns and margins during a challenging quarter. While we cannot control the macroeconomic backdrop or directly influence the demand for housing, we can and will stay focused on strengthening our platform and increasing operational efficiencies to drive future growth. We are closely monitoring each market submarket and project as we strive to balance pace and price to maximize returns. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented and undercapitalized industry and are optimistic about Forestar's ability to continue to execute well, consolidate market share in any operating environment.I would like to add on to Jim's earlier comment about our capital structure being a big competitive advantage, because it is our team that is our biggest advantage. I could not be more proud than to be a part of this team. Their knowledge and experience and the way that they have dealt with the challenges of this past year are truly remarkable. Looking forward, we continue to believe that D.R. Horton and many other homebuilders will shift their focus towards buying finished lots from third-party developers. Instead of self-developing. With our broad geographic footprint, attractive land positions, strong balance sheet, and most importantly, our experienced team. Forestar is well positioned to be the last supplier of choice to homebuilders. We are planning for the long-term and have a track record of solid execution.We proactively and methodically started to implement our downturn playbook over 18-months ago by adjusting our pace of new land acquisition in preparation for today's current environment. When appropriate, we will leverage our platform and balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to build shareholder value. Our flexibility enables us to quickly adjust to meet the needs of our customers. Our team has managed through market cycles before and we are well positioned to navigate these challenging market conditions. John, at this time, we'll now open up the line for questions.See also 11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy and 10 Biggest HVAC Companies in the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Geraghty added that TrueBlue also registered a 40 percent year-over-year increase in co-branded signups.“(The loyalty program) continues to not only exceed our expectations, but also hit new records,” said CEO Robin Hayes.JetBlue also projects another major boost from True Blue, having announced last month it would make major upgrades to the program for the first time in a decade. The company said it would expand its elite Mosaic programs and create a level of mileage accumulation named tiles enabling customers to obtain perks before reaching mosaic levels of flying.TrueBlue was far from the only major area of growth for JetBlue in 2022. Geraghty credited a surge in passengers from its Northeast Alliance with American Airlines as a reason for its strong fourth quarter.“We’re very pleased with performance of the (Northeast Alliance),” she said. “We’re seeing the (Northeast Alliance) very much on the correct trajectory.While Geraghty declined to provide financial details about its relationship with American, she stated the company expects that its partnership with American Airlines to produce more revenue, with Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Helane Becker predicting on Thursday that JetBlue will look to expand its partnership with American in 2023. The company more than tripled its number of daily flights from New York’s LaGuardia Airport in 2022 compared to prior to the pandemic.JetBlue also expects to see capacity increase up to 8 percent year-over-year, both for the first quarter and the full year of 2023. The carrier’s capacity for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by 2.4 percent from the same period in 2019.Story continuesHowever, chief financial officer Ursula Hurley said JetBlue projects a net loss in the first quarter of 2023, adding that the company is grappling with higher labor costs and surging rentals and landing fees.Meanwhile, Hayes also addressed JetBlue’s planned merger with Spirit Airlines. He said he expects the transaction to close by no later than the first half of 2024, stating it could happen sooner if the company is able to reach an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department also filed an antitrust suit against American and JetBlue in September 2021, arguing the two carrier’s alliance had reduced competition for consumers. A ruling from a judge, which potentially has major implications for the JetBlue-Spirit merger, could come soon.“If we (reach an agreement), it’s possible that could happen sooner. But the timeline is down to the Department of Justice, and we certainly want to be respectful of that,” Hayes said, acknowledging the possibility of the Justice Department suing JetBlue if an agreement doesn’t place, which would delay the closing of the merger.Regarding JetBlue’s fourth quarter financial performance, Becker said results were mostly in line with expectations. The company recorded an adjusted net profit of $72 million for the period. The carrier also saw its revenue per available set mile increase 16.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same timeframe in 2019.This story is from Skift's Airline Weekly.

In partnership with Airlink, a nonprofit humanitarian organization dedicated to bringing critical aid to communities in crisis, American is carrying more than 55 tons of medical supplies from Europe to Miami, where they will be staged for distribution to Haiti.""We're proud to partner with Airlink to make a positive impact on the world,"" said Greg Schwendinger, President of American Airlines Cargo. ""At American, our mission is to care for people on life's journey, and we are honored to play a role in transporting critical goods to the people and places they are needed most.""Cholera, which spreads mainly through contaminated food and water, has sickened thousands of people in Haiti since the outbreak began in October 2022. The illness has worsened a humanitarian crisis caused by civil unrest that makes accessing supplies difficult for health care workers in the Caribbean country. American will serve as a vital link in moving personal protective equipment (PPE), clean water filters, nebulizers, blood tubes and other sterile items to help fight the crisis.American first partnered with Airlink in March 2022 to ship humanitarian aid to those impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. Since then, it has carried nearly 90 tons of life-saving cargo to the region. Through this partnership, American helped transport cargo and relief personnel for 47 different non-profit organizations, supporting humanitarian efforts in 21 different countries.Last year, American and its customers donated 85 million AAdvantage® miles to Airlink though American's Miles for Social Good program.

TJDarmstadt / Wikimedia CommonsDespite a number of constraints in the aviation industry, American Airlines has achieved a full year of profitability for the first time since 2019.The airline had a total revenue in 2022 of $49 billion, an increase of 7 percent over 2019, and a total net income of $803 million — all while flying 8.7 percent less capacity. And that is despite a $1.9 billion pretax loss in the first quarter.It was also the best fourth quarter the company has ever had, with a total revenue of $13.2 billion, an increase of 16.6 percent from in 2019.Airline executives shared the details during a quarterly earnings call Thursday morning.“Key to our success has been sizing our airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we expect to encounter. And we will continue to do that going forward,” said American CEO Robert Isom.Now, post-holiday bookings are the strongest they have ever been, said Robert Isom, CEO of American. Demand for domestic and short-haul international flights is leading that business, and international flights are expected to increase this year.Even with the financial uptick, American is still working against multiple post-pandemic issues — including a workforce shortage, supplier constraints, and higher expenses — that will affect growth and operations over the next year.Higher Costs and Resource ConstraintsAmerican spent $13.8 billion on fuel and related taxes in 2022. It was $6.8 billion in 2021.Total operating expenses were $47.4 billion in 2022, up from $30.9 billion in 2021.The biggest cost right now is that the fleet is not being utilized at the level it should be, Isom said. That is being addressed in part by modernizing and simplifying feet, but there are other opportunities that can offset those costs, like airport rent, landing fees, and maintenance.“The fleet’s meant to be flown. Those are the areas I would probably look to most as being opportunities for us to see much greater efficiency,” said Devon May, chief financial officer for American.Story continuesAmerican is also experiencing upfront costs as it goes through a big hiring phase to replace retiring pilots and other workers.The company is considering those multiple factors as it plans for the year.“What is different from times past is we have been very conscious in Q1 about how we use the airline’s resources — it’s people, it’s planes, it’s facilities, everything — largely so that we can have as much of that capacity for the summer peak as possible,” said Vasu Raja, chief commercial officer for American.Still, American is making progress in its effort to pay down $15 billion in debt by the end of 2025. The company has now reduced its total debt by $8.2 billion and expects to pay down another $3.3 billion this year.Fleet ModernizationAmerican expects to add 23 airplanes to its fleet this year, 12 of which are financed.That is fewer than the airline had been planning, however.Despite Boeing’s contractual commitment to deliver 27 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2023, the airplane manufacturer has informed American that it will deliver 17 this year, said Derek Kerr, president of American Eagle.“This change in timing will shift planned [capital expenditure] out of 2023 and into future years,” Kerr said.In August, American started receiving Boeing 787-8 planes for the first time in 15 months. American obtained five 787-8 planes during the last quarter, and four more are expected in the first half of 2023. Boeing 787-9 planes are expected to be delivered starting in the fourth quarter.“What we have now is aircraft manufacturers that are just starting to get their feet back under them,” Isom said.“We continue to work with both Airbus and Boeing to make sure that we encourage them in an appropriate fashion to deliver on time. And I know that they’re working hard to make sure that they can meet our needs.”American has shed 50 long-haul aircraft over the last few years, many of which were inefficient planes like the 757 or 767, he said. The company has also simplified the airline to four fleet types and has increased seating capacity in its existing fleet.It’s part of the airline’s ongoing work to simplify and modernize the fleet, which executives said will ultimately lead to higher aircraft utilization that will offset investment costs.“What that enables us to do is in the fleet that’s left, we can much more dynamically alter schedules to follow where the demand is,” Raja said. “We can produce schedules that … are a lot more operable and, frankly, a lot more efficient. We’ve seen the benefits of that in our recent revenue performance, and we anticipate the benefits of that in the year ahead.”The airline has also been working on investments in technology to track crew location and maintenance requirements, as well as tech that can help the company more efficiently manage big events like winter storms.Hiring and Workforce ShortageAmerican has hired 40,000 people over the last two years.That includes hundreds of pilots, with plans to hire 2,000 this year to replace a large number of retiring pilots. There were nearly 900 retirements last year, and 2023 will likely have around the same.“We’re going through the greatest training cycle of pilots that we’ve ever experienced,” Isom said. “So we’re stretching our training resources like we’ve never before. But fortunately, we planned for this.”American and the rest of the industry is combatting a pilot shortage.“American took the monumental step last year of greatly increasing regional pilot pay.

544,4a197144-7069-37ad-a65b-f14f91232e3b,AFL,2023-01-27,Can Aflac's (AFL) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates on Lower Expenses?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflacs-afl-q4-earnings-beat-121512565.html,1674735312,STORY,"['AFL', 'HIG-PG', 'AON']","[Aflac Incorporated AFL is set to continue its earnings beat streak in the fourth quarter of 2022, the results of which are expected to be released on Feb 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading insurance provider reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.23, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, due to reduced benefits and expenses, partly offset by a variable investment income loss from alternative investments and a weaker contribution to revenues from its Japan and U.S. businesses.Now, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.21 has witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against no movement in the opposite direction. The estimated figure, however, suggests a decrease of 5.5% from the prior-year reported number.Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.22 per share suggests a 4.9% year-over-year decline. Aflac beat the consensus estimate in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 4.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $4.5 billion indicate a 17.4% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Aflac this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently +1.29%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.23 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: Aflac currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.Factors to NoteAFL’s U.S. operations in the fourth quarter are likely to have benefited from the Fed interest rate hikes, but Japan’s operations are likely to have been affected by adversities on sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income of $824 indicates a 9.5% year-over-year decrease while our estimate suggests a 13% decline. This is likely to have been partially offset by improved returns from alternative investments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total net earned premiums is pegged at $3,544 million, signaling a decline of 16.5% from a year ago while our estimate suggests a 20.2% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. This is likely to have resulted in a year-over-year decrease in AFL’s bottom line.The consensus mark for pre-tax income in Aflac Japan is pegged at $705 million, signaling a decrease of 20.5% from the year-ago period. We expect the metric to fall 25.4% year over year in the fourth quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for pre-tax income in Aflac U.S. is pegged at $285 million, indicating a 9.2% increase from a year ago due to lower costs. This is likely to have positioned the company for an earnings beat in the fourth quarter.Thanks to Aflac’s multiple cost-curbing efforts, expenses are likely to have declined in the quarter under review. A reduction in operations is expected to have played part in lowering costs, partially offsetting the fall in profit levels. Our estimate for total benefits and expenses suggests a 20% year-over-year decrease.The company is expected to have made substantial investments in core technology platforms or digital capabilities. Among these platforms, AFL remains steadfast in upgrading its dental and vision platforms to manage higher volumes. The investments are aimed at boosting operational efficiencies and triggering accretive growth in earned premiums in the long run.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader finance space that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Ares Capital Corporation ARCC has an Earnings ESP of +9.58% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ares Capital’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 56 cents per share, implying a 7.7% improvement from the year-ago figure. ARCC beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with an average surprise of 3%.Aon plc AON has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AON’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.67 per share, which witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against one downward movement.

We're just a few minutes away from the closing bell. So let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to break down today's market action. Hello, sir.JARED BLIKRE: Hello. Let's start out with the energy sector. By the way, energy sector, the leading sector today, up 3%, followed by all the mega-cap sectors. XLY. XLC. XLK. We'll get to some of those in a minute. Let's check this out because tomorrow morning we're getting Chevron earnings. Today, we are getting an announcement that they are increasing their buyback to $75 billion. This is on top of their existing authorization. They're also hiking their dividend. No expiration date on the buybacks. But RBC expects the oil major to ratchet up the monthly pace. JPMorgan also believing that this could signal better guidance in Chevron's announcement.Tomorrow morning, we're going to bring you to that live. And let's just take a look at what's happened in the energy sector this year. We know it was one of the best-- well, it was by far the best sector last year. But we can see Schlumberger up 7%, Exxon up 6%. We're going to be getting into a lot of those energy earnings in the coming days. Also want to check out something called Sherwin-Williams here. And if I can find my home builders screen, we're going to see that is down substantially. Sherwin down about 8 and 1/2%.And, well, I'll tell you what. The only thing worse than watching paint dry is watching your portfolio shrink because, guess what, having its worst day in two quarters. And that's after delivering a full-year forecast that disappointed. Now, we know the housing sector has been battered and bruised. And Sherwin as a proxy is now issuing a warning. Here's the CEO saying we will not be immune from what we expect to be a very challenging demand environment in 2023. Visibility. That's beyond our first half of the year. That's going to be limited. So caveat painter here.Story continuesAnd let's get back to some of the meme stocks that we've been talking about, most recently Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Let's get to the intraday. We got that right there. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has so shrunk that it's hard to find on this screen here. Let me just sort by equal weight here. And we can see at the very bottom-- there we go. There have been several price halts today due to volatility. And that's based on the explanation that they gave in their 10-Q or 8-K today saying that they may have to file for reorganization. That means chapter 11.So it looks like we got about a minute left here. Let's just cycle through some of the happenings today. We checked out the sector action before. Let's check out our market leaders now. KWEB. That is the Chinese ETF. That is in the forefront. That's up almost 3%. But then we have IGV. That is a software tech ETF. FTN is internet ETF. So those leading is actually pretty strong. Ahead of ARK, even stronger. We're also seeing some strength in the chip stocks. All of these on the top line are outperforming cannabis stocks. And this liquidity, this US bond ETF, those are the only ones in the red.Now, as promised, here is the NASDAQ 100, where we see the mega caps cooperating. We see Microsoft up 3% after its earnings the other day. Tesla up 10%. We're going to be bringing you Intel after the bell. So stay tuned for that in just a few minutes. Other than that, Meta. Even Meta is up 4%. Didn't see really any news about that today. But it's nice to see all this green.]"

So, we have a full complement of management team here today.Story continuesAnd we'll start -- Richard will make some opening remarks, and then he'll turn it back to me and we'll cover the slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Turn it to you, Richard.Richard Adkerson: Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. Thank you all for joining us today. As Kathleen said, after my overview remarks, which will be brief, she will review our results for the quarter. It was a strong fourth quarter. The numbers speak for themselves. It reflects the performance of our global team, and I much appreciate everybody's hard work. I read one of you said this morning in a report, mining is a tough business, and it certainly is. Nobody knows that, I think, better than me. But what we've done and is reflected in our results for 2022 and particularly the fourth quarter, is remarkable. Most of you, who know our business and maybe all of you do, recognize the need to look at Freeport into two major segments. Our operations in Indonesia by PT Freeport Indonesia is characterized by very large volumes, very low cost because of the grades and the gold content, largest gold mine in the world is a byproduct.As you'll see in the fourth quarter, it operated as the world's second largest copper mine with a net unit cost of $0.06 a pound. Our business in Americas is quite different. We have among the largest mines in the world, the mines have low grades, there's much more material to be processed, to be mined in process to recover the copper, and it's an operation that gets challenged by low copper prices and factors like inflation. But when you look at the results and what our team has done this year, it's been very positive. It's also characterized by having some large future brownfield expansion opportunities, which is particularly meaningful given the situation of the copper in the world. Indonesia, it was just rock solid performance. We've been operating underground there for 40-plus years now.We've been investing in the current underground operations that we have been ramping up over the past three years to become the largest underground mining operations in the world for the past 25 years. It just reflects the long-term nature of our business. The last three years have really been notable. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit, which had been the bulk of our operations since the discovery of the ore body in the late 1980s. We completed mining that pit at the end of 2019. Then early in 2020, we faced COVID. And for years, this transition was viewed as a risk overlying Freeport's business. And it's just a major accomplishment that we've reached our targeted mining and metal production targets that is what's arguably the most complicated mine in the world.And it's all results of the hard work and accomplishments of our team there, very proud of them. The Americas business has done very well in meeting the challenges that we've had there, dealing with inflation, dealing with a period of low copper prices, we have issues that are challenged in terms of getting workers for our operations in the Americas. Our operation in Peru was facing a severe challenge with COVID that they manage very well. The political situation in Peru right now is very complicated. There are protests throughout the country. Our team is doing very well. We are continuing to manage housing, feeding our people and continuing our operations. We are slowing down a bit to make sure we have supplies for the long run, but we have support by our workforce and fundamental support for our business by the local community there because we've established such a great relationship with them.So we are -- as we look out now trying to predict short-term copper prices is very difficult. We actually don't even try to do it ourselves. We deal with short-term negative movements when they occur by having a strong balance sheet and a conservative financial policy. It's actually good to see right now that market sentiment going into 2024 is much improved over the end of -- going into the fourth quarter. But we are on the outlook for the well-known risks that the world faces today, and we're prepared to deal with it. We are a long-term business. And we -- everything we do is focused, not on the short run other than to protect ourselves by having a strong balance sheet, managing our business in the right way, but our success is going to be measured over the long run.And copper's long-run outlook is increasingly positive based on fundamentals of demand and supply. We committed to copper 20 years ago when we were a single asset company, the rationale for acquiring Phelps Dodge more than 15 years ago is being reinforced today by the combination of this really special mine we have in Indonesia and the global operations and growing operations that we have in the Americas. It was the right decision 20 years ago to focus on copper and is the right decision now. Kathleen?Kathleen Quirk: Thanks, Richard. We'll start on slide 3, which summarizes our performance for the full year 2022. And just a couple of notes on the fourth quarter from our press release. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter. Copper and gold sales exceeded our October guidance. And our consolidated unit net cash costs of $1.53 per pound in the quarter were better than our estimates going into the quarter. With average copper realizations in the fourth quarter of $3.77 per pound, we generated strong margins with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA at approximately $2.25 billion. Looking at the year, we are proud of the performance of our team stayed focused on effective execution and on driving results in a volatile macroeconomic environment.After successfully growing our volumes in 2021 by 19% for copper and 59% for gold compared with 2020, we achieved another year of growth in 2022, with 11% higher copper sales volumes and a 34% increase in gold volumes. Our team in Indonesia has successfully and materially grown production levels and a sustaining large-scale, low-cost production at the world's largest underground mining complex. In the Americas, our teams in Peru and Chile proved resilient in restoring production during 2022 that had been impacted by the pandemic. And our teams in the U.S. maintain production at 2021 levels despite ongoing labor shortages and we also made significant advances on new technologies to enhance value. For the year, we generated $9.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and that was a year of dramatic swings in commodity prices and cost drivers.Our operating cash flows for the year, which were net of $1.5 billion in working capital requirements was in excess of our capital investments in our operations, and we nearly tripled our cash return to shareholders, pursuant to our performance-based payout policy. We ended the year with net debt, excluding the debt associated with our smelter of $1.3 billion, and that's substantially below the level of mid-2021 when we initiated our performance-based payout policy. On slide 4, you'll see we've listed notable accomplishments during the year. In addition to driving value in our operating and financial areas of achievement, we're very proud of our work with third parties to validate all of our operations under the Copper Mark standards, the measurable progress we're making on our climate initiatives and the expanded disclosures we've developed to enhance transparency and accountability.We'll talk about markets next, and we've got a slide on page 5. We experienced significant volatility as many of you have seen during 2022, with copper prices trading from a high of $4.87 per pound earlier in the year, falling to $3.18 per pound midyear and partially recovering to $3.80 per pound by year-end. Prices continued to move higher in early 2023 to a level currently approximating $4.25 per pound as several of the macroeconomic clouds began to lift. We discussed on prior calls that the dramatic moves in 2022 have been largely -- been based on sentiment rather than fundamentals. The facts are that the physical markets for copper have remained tight even during a period of weaker economic data coming out of China, and that's evidenced by the low levels of available copper inventories throughout the year.At the same time, copper's importance in the economy continues to grow as a result of the intensity of use in clean energy applications and the global acceleration of electrification. We believe we're still in the early innings of a broad-based secular driver of long-term demand. The ability of the industry to meet this multiyear period of growing demand continues to be challenged, leading to large market deficits in the future. You read about these challenges every day, and it's getting harder, not easier, higher long-term prices are needed to incentivize new supplies. We've lived through the ups and downs in the copper market. We've effectively managed our operations and balance sheet during periods of volatility, and we're prepared for this, but we believe the long-term fundamentals point to a real step change in how copper is valued in the economy.Turning to our reserve position on slide 6. We benefit from a geographically diverse high-quality portfolio of copper mines with significant exposure to gold and molybdenum. Our strategy, as Richard discussed, is centered around being foremost in copper. And we benefit from a portfolio of assets with characteristics that are very difficult to replicate. We show our reserve position at the end of 2022 with over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves. We have an average reserve life of over 25 years. We added twice the amount of reserves we produced in 2022, principally at our U.S. mines in the Morenci and Safford Lone Star districts where we're focused on future growth. In addition to proved and probable reserves, we have enormous mineral resources of 235 billion pounds of copper.Over half of this is located in the U.S. where we have established operations, a great track record and a valuable franchise. We'll continue to work as we go forward to convert these resources into viable mine plans and future production. It's an extraordinarily valuable resource position in a world that's going to need more copper in the future. We wanted to focus a little bit on molybdenum on this call. And on slide 7, we've got some information about our molybdenum business. We're a leader in that industry. We're the world's largest producer by a significant margin. And with the price move over the last couple of months of over 50% in molybdenum, we thought you'd be interested in learning more about our business. We produced 85 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022, and that's comprised about 60% from copper mines as a byproduct and the balance from two primary molybdenum mines that we operate in Colorado.And these are the only primary molybdenum mines that are currently operated in the United States. We also operate downstream processing facilities to produce products that are used in a broad range of metallurgical specialty steel and chemical applications. The price move from $18 per pound at the start of the fourth quarter to over $30 per pound currently has been driven by some of the same supply issues that have impacted copper. And in addition, demand drivers continue to be supported from the oil and gas, aerospace and power generation sectors. So, we note on this slide, the impact of a $5 change in molybdenum prices, it's material at $400 million in annual EBITDA and $375 million in cash flow. And the recent move of over $10 per pound, if sustained at a higher price, adds additional leverage to our results.Looking at our operating stats for 2022 on slide 8, you'll see our sales for the year were about 35% from the U.S., 28% from South America and 37% from Indonesia. In the U.S., our sales were similar to 2021 levels, and we grew sales volumes by 10% in South America and by 20% in Indonesia. In the U.S., we're continuing our focus on productivity, given the current limitations on adding to our workforce, we're taking advantage of technology advancements and opportunities to expand production from leaching at low incremental cost, and we're planning our next phase of growth, as we'll talk about in a few minutes. As discussed, the biggest resource position and source of long-term growth we have is a real opportunity in the United States. In South America, both Cerro Verde and El Abra grew production in 2022 in a complex social and political environment.After successfully recovering from the pandemic-related interruptions in 2022, our team in Peru is now dealing with challenges associated with civil unrest that you've all read about. We're prioritizing the safety and security of our workforce. We're navigating disruptions to transportation routes and supply chains. To date, the impacts have not been significant but the situation is dynamic day by day, and we're watching it very carefully. The bottom of the chart shows the 2022 cost performance. As we've talked about on prior calls, we experienced significant inflation pressures across the business during 2022, particularly for energy and other commodity-related consumables, and in the second half of the year, started to see inflation from a rising cost of materials, supplies and services.The situation started to improve in 2022 with a number of the commodity-related consumables, but we're still dealing with costs in excess of historical levels. If you look at the average cost for the year at Grasberg of $0.09 per pound is remarkable, particularly in the context of this cost environment. Richard talked about the significant success story of the Grasberg transition, and we've got some details on slide 9, significant success for not only Freeport but also something for the global mining industry to be proud of in the country of Indonesia. We started planning for this transition over 25 years ago, and the team has just done an outstanding job. We benefit from the fact that several from the team who were involved in the planning of this project, including Mark Johnson, who's on this call, stayed with it over this period.And over the years, we've added great talent to our team with experts from around the world. The success of this project, the mutual respect built over the years between Freeport, the government of Indonesia and local communities has established a really strong foundation for the future. We've got the opportunity with this resource to plan a new phase of development longer term and are continuing to discuss with the government the opportunity to extend our long-term partnership beyond 2041. If you go to slide 10, we've got an update on our smelter project. And this is our key feature of our commitment to the Indonesian government, was to expand domestic copper smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia. We're making really good progress on constructing the new smelter in Eastern Java, it's near our existing smelter, PT Smelting at Gresik.You can see from the pictures that construction is advancing. We've got thousands of workers now on site. We're working very closely with our EPC contractor to try as much as possible to make up delays that were caused by the pandemic. We reached a milestone of over 50% completion recently and we are expecting to begin commissioning the smelter during 2024. As you recall, the capital investments for this project are being funded from a successful bond offering that PT-FI completed during 2022. And so, we have the funding between the bond offering and a revolver at PT-FI to fund this project. Moving to our growth outlook. This is exciting opportunities for the Company, and we continue to plan our next phase of growth. We've got benefit from having multiple organic projects to develop within the portfolio over time.We operate all the mines we have interest in. We're able to share experiences, new technologies, operating synergies and best practices across the portfolio as we develop projects, and we can direct capital across the portfolio to the highest value opportunities. Our proven technical capacity capabilities and management is a notable strength. And importantly, we've earned a track record and a reputation for operating sustainably and responsibly. The world, we believe, is going to need all of our projects and more. The project with the shortest lead time is our Americas leach initiative. We've talked a lot about it in recent calls. The economics are compelling, low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint.The new data analytics capabilities, we are continuing, to be applied to prioritize our work streams on the highest value. We're continuing our work to apply covers to the leach stockpiles because of the benefits that you get from heat retention in enhancing recoveries, and we've identified new areas that were not pursued historically. We're also continuing to test various additives that can further enhance recoveries. This is a really significant opportunity for us. We're continuing to target a run rate of 200 million pounds per annum by the end of this year and success of this level -- at this level would provide opportunities to scale larger. We're in a great position to lead this innovation with our long history in leaching and large inventory to work with.At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we're progressing a feasibility study to double production at that site. We expect to complete the feasibility this year, and we'll be in a position to assess options on how we time the future development. We started advanced planning to commence construction of a new tailings site that would support the existing operation, but would also provide flexibility for the expanded production. And as a brownfield expansion, this project could be developed more quickly than a greenfield development. Our Lone Star opportunity is really something special. We've been successful in increasing production levels substantially above the original project. And we're really in the early stages in the development of this mine, as we mine the oxide ores more quickly, we're opening up the opportunity for a major sulfide development long term.The resource is massive. You've seen the numbers, 50 billion pounds of potential resource here. We're doing a lot of drilling. And importantly, it's located in an established mining district in the U.S. In Chile, we've defined the opportunity for a major expansion at our El Abra mine. As we continue to monitor regulatory and fiscal matters in Chile, we're planning a project to invest in infrastructure, water infrastructure to provide flexibility to extend existing operations and optionality to support a new concentrator. We're also planning at El Abra to test new leaching technologies in the near term, to evaluate the potential for expanded leach production and possibly competing technologies to a concentrator. We're continuing our development of the Kucing Liar deposit in Indonesia.We're really gaining a lot of efficiencies from the work we did at Grasberg Block Cave. And similar to that development, this is a long-term project. We expect to have initial production from Kucing Liar deposit towards the end of this decade. Moving to slide 12. We provide a three-year outlook for our sales volumes. And as we talked about, we achieved two years of growth in copper sales. And currently, our forecast reflects sales in the 23 to 25 period that are similar to 2022 levels. Our mine production is actually going to be higher than our sales by about 100 million pounds in 2023 and 2024. And that is a result of our domestic processing arrangements in Indonesia where the point of sale has changed from selling concentrate to selling cathodes.Pixabay/Public DomainAnd so, a portion of our production will be inventoried until it's processed and sold through our smelters. Previously, this inventory would have been held by third-party smelters. We've got small revisions otherwise to 2023 guidance that reflects assumption of a continuation of tight labor markets in the U.S. That's impacted our ability to increase mining rates. And success also in our leach recovery initiative could provide some upside in the U.S. as we look over the next three-year period. In the reference materials on slide 30, we provide information on our 2023 sales by quarter. The reason for the drop in the first quarter reflects the impact of the tolling arrangement in Indonesia. But, you can see the balance of the year is fairly stable at over 1 billion pounds of copper sales per quarter.Moving to the cost outlook for 2023, we're providing guidance of average cost of $1.60 per pound for the year. That compares with $1.50 per pound in 2022. We show a comparison to the two years, and you'll see the site production cost line item is about 4.5% higher than the 2022 average. And that's a result of assumptions that we've made in our forecast for higher average electricity and coal costs compared with the 2022 average and also higher power requirements, principally in Indonesia, and the impact of higher cost of equipment components, supply costs and labor cost increases. The other line items are offsetting. You'll note a decline in royalties and duties. That really is reflective of a recent reduction in our export duty in Indonesia as a result of the smelter progress.I'll also note that this assumes a molybdenum price of $20 per pound in 2023. The current price is $30 a pound and each $2 per pound change in molybdenum is $0.02 a pound. So, if current prices hold, would have roughly $0.10 a pound less cash -- unit net cash costs and this reflects. In recent months, inflationary pressures have been less severe than we experienced during 2022. We're encouraged by that. And we're going to continue to focus on managing costs that we can control. We're continuing to pursue technology-driven enhancements to mitigate the impacts, particularly in the U.S. Getting to our cash flows, significant leverage to copper prices. We've got on slide 14, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $3.50 per pound to $5 per pound copper.These are modeled results and we use the average of 24 and 25 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,900 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. And you'll see here that annual EBITDA would range from nearly $9 billion per annum at $3.50 copper, to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows would range over these prices from $6 billion at $350 copper to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show sensitivities to various commodities on the right and input costs. With our long-life reserves and large-scale production, we're well positioned from future -- to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends with prospects for increasing cash returns under our performance-based payout framework.Our capital expenditure plans are summarized on slide 15. The capital expenditures totaled $2.7 billion, excluding the smelter in 2022. We'll note that this was lower than the $3.3 billion estimate we provided going into 2022, and that reflects lead times and our focus during the year to prioritize critical projects. The current forecast for 2023 totals $3.4 billion, and that's a slight change from our previous estimate of $3.3 billion for 2023. And capital expenditures for 2024 currently forecast to approximate $3 billion as spending on the Grasberg projects reach completion. We always are very careful in managing our capital cost to maintain flexibility in response to market condition, while ensuring that our investments are sufficient to support a reliable long-term production profile.Returning to the financial policy that we began to implement in the second half of 2021, it's really centered on three priorities. The cornerstone of the financial policy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity. And that provides significant flexibility for the future. We've been executing on this performance-based payout. It provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. Since commencing the performance-based payout policy in the second half of 2021, we've returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. And at the same time, we also further strengthened our balance sheet, providing capacity for funding new projects over time.We did not purchase shares in the second half of 2022 because of the significant change in market conditions and the resulting impact on cash flows in the second half of the year. The improved market conditions will drive increased free cash flow, which will boost shareholder returns, and our future discretionary share purchases will be dependent on our cash flow and overall market conditions. We believe the three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flows to a mix of shareholder returns, and organic growth will enhance long-term value of our business. In closing, I just want to reiterate our view about the positioning for the Company, a bright long-term future supported by our attractive portfolio of assets, supported by the fundamentals of the copper business and the positive outlook for the markets we serve.Our team is energized. We're motivated to continue building long-term value in our business and on executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank you for your attention, and operator, we'll now open the call for questions.See also 18 Countries that Produce the Most Nuclear Energy and 15 Stocks That Have Increased Dividends for 25 Years.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index.

On October 28, the company said it will seek to raise productivity levels in 2023 by reshuffling its drilling portfolio to target wells with potentially higher returns.

The analyst cited a combination of premium valuation and well performance risks for the rating, and suggested that while management expects well productivity trends to improve this year, it may not be immediately clear if or when this change will occur.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) was part of 49 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 56 in the prior quarter.

Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”7. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 25: 6.72Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. The analyst noted that the company's recent acquisitions and existing resource base support its goal of annual production growth of up to 5% per year.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

""Musk is an incredible driving force, but he is also the one that brings unnecessary risk, in a way, to the situation.""The prickly billionaire reminded investors of that risk at times on Tesla's earnings call late Wednesday, really only showing signs of his trademark exuberance when discussing artificial intelligence.That's not surprising given that Musk has been kept busy by efforts to reduce debt at Twitter, appearances in court, studying rocket designs, and staying up late with the Tesla AI team the day before the call.SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk smiles during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019.

He then announced Cybertruck production will be delayed until the summer, with ""volume production"" commencing in 2024. The company's volume growth guidance for 2023 of 38% was also below a long-term target of 50%.Navigating all these uncertainties would be a tall order for a single CEO, let alone one that lives multiple lives across multiple companies.At the same time, to Houchois's point, Musk's commentary on the call underscored his magic touch at Tesla.The company will finally get in the electric truck game this year with the Cybertruck (even if it's delayed a bit). Electric semi trucks have begun to ship to customers such as PepsiCo (PEP). And recent price cuts on various models appear to be igniting demand.Tesla shares rose about 9% during Thursday's session as investors zeroed in on the positives for the Tesla story.""With Twitter noise starting to slowly dissipate and the demand story roaring out of the gates in 2023 despite a darker macro [economy], we walk away from this call incrementally more bullish on Tesla into 2023,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a client note.Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent® (dupilumab), recommending expanded approval in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In June 2022, Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children in this age group.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age, which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense, persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body, resulting in skin dryness, cracking, pain, redness or darkening, crusting and oozing, which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS), which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from a Phase 3 trial in children 6 months to 5 years of age recently published in The Lancet, which met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks, Dupixent plus low-potency TCS improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity compared to TCS alone (the placebo arm). Dupixent patients also experienced reduced itch and skin pain as well as improved sleep quality and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Long-term data further showed a sustained improvement in these disease measures up to one year. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent in this atopic dermatitis population compared to placebo included conjunctivitis and eosinophilia.Story continuesThe use of Dupixent in infants and young children less than 6 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis, as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, prurigo nodularis, asthma, CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”10.

(NYSE:AIG).AIG reported strong Q2 earnings, but volatile capital markets led to delays in the IPO of the company’s life and retirement business and concerns about the quality of the company’s investment portfolio. We continue to believe AIG has one of the best management teams in the industry, and they’ve been executing well on turning the business around and improving underwriting and expense control.”8.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52P/E Ratio as of January 25: 10.33EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was incorporated in 1985 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range.

Welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.Lance Fritz: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. And welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. The fourth quarter and 2022 overall were challenging for Union Pacific and our employees. The lengthy labor negotiations tested our work force, while customers felt the impact of our service issues. Two things are critically important as we turn the page to 2023. First, is the trend line of improving free car velocity since late summer, although acknowledging there were bumps along the way. And second, is how we move forward, establishing consistent service for our customers day-in and day-out and demonstrating to all stakeholders our commitment to excellence.Now turning to our fourth quarter results. This morning Union Pacific is reporting 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% deteriorated 360 basis points versus 2021, driven by continued service challenges and the impact from winter weather. For the full year, reported operating ratio finished at 60.1%, deteriorating 290 basis points, driven by operational inefficiency, inflation and higher fuel prices. The entire Union Pacific team recognizes that 2022 did not beat expectations. Crew constraints in critical locations impacted by shifting demand had a real impact on our performance. As you will hear from Eric, we are building resiliency into the network through hiring efforts, shifting critical resources and better operations to address that shortfall, and you are seeing those benefits manifested in how the network has responded since Thanksgiving through the ups and downs of extreme winter weather.Story continuesThese challenges aside, we achieved volume growth for the year. We demonstrated our commitment to meet customer needs with business development wins that are critical to long-term financial success. The recent onboarding of Schneider is a great proof statement of delivering on that commitment. We also made significant progress towards our climate goals. In 2022, we increased our biofuel blend to over 4.5% on pace to achieve our 2030 target of 20%. This is a key initiative in achieving our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In addition, for a fourth consecutive year, we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, lowering at 1% to an all-time record. This helped our customers avoid 23.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck.Union Pacific will continue to be a rail leader in sustainability. Now let's start with Kenny for an update on the business environment.Kenny Rocker: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was up 1% compared to 2021. Gains in our Premium Business Group were partially offset by a decline in our Bulk area. However, freight revenue was up 9%, driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong price. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with Bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 7% compared to 2021, driven by a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 2%, driven by a decrease in export grain shipments. Despite strong market demand, we faced service and weather challenges that slow shuttle cycle times, as well as having a tough 2021 comparable.Fertilizer carloads were down 15% year-over-year driven by reduced shipments for potash due to market softness along with another tough comp the 2021 fourth quarter. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced shipments of finished beverage product and their associated raw materials. And lastly, coal and renewable carloads remained flat in the quarter, as our ability to capture demand from favorable natural gas prices was impacted by weather and service challenges, particularly in late December. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains, somewhat offset by a negative business mix. Volume for the quarter was flat.Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 4% year-over-year driven by lower Industrial chemicals demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth, driven in part by our business development efforts. Volume was up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments and growth in construction materials. Forest products volume declined 17% year-over-year, driven by weak corrugated box demand and softness in the housing market. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by an increased waste and soda ash demand, partially offset by pure petroleum shipments from regulatory changes in Mexico markets. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 15% on a 3% increase in volume.Average revenue per car increased 12% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 9%, driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles. Intermodal volume was up 2%, driven by increased international shipments, mainly due to an easier comp in 2021. Although domestic volumes decreased due to soft market demand, declining truck rates and increased over the roll capacity, the aforementioned negative impact was partially offset with the Schneider conversion in December. Now as we look ahead to 2023, you can see the macro indicators that we are watching along with inflation and interest rates, and you will notice that we have some challenges with Industrial production, imports and housing starts.However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to slide eight. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins.Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment. As I wrap up my comments, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our customers and the operating team.Over the past month, extreme weather events impacted large portions of our network and I want to thank our employees who safely worked around the clock in harsh conditions to keep the railroad running for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.Eric Gehringer: Thanks, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on slide 10, safety is at the foundation of everything we do. We have enhanced our training programs and are working to solidify our safety culture through ownership and personal accountability. These efforts drove an 18% improvement in our 2022 full year personal injury safety results, which is at the lowest level in 5 years. We look to leverage these gains to improve derailment performance in 2023. While good progress, overall, our goal remains returning each employee home safely at the end of the day. Moving now to slide 11 for a look at our current operational performance, our attention throughout 2022 was focused on onboarding the necessary crew resources to operate a fluid network and meet customer demand.I would like to thank our partners and workforce resources and the operating team for their great work in recruiting and onboarding new team members. We currently have around 600 employees in training as our pipeline is significantly stronger than it was a year ago. That being said, our hiring efforts will continue in 2023, as we backfill for attrition and target locations across the northern region, where crude challenges persist. In the near-term, we will continue to utilize borrow outs to supplement crew shortfalls. Another key element in increasing fluidity is the reduction of excess inventory, which builds the foundation for a strong and resilient service product. I am proud of the progress we made, which would have not been accomplished without the dedication and tireless work of the commercial and operating teams.Photo by Sven Piper on UnsplashMother Nature threatened to derail some of that progress in the last weeks of December with blizzard conditions and extreme cool temperatures across much of the network. However, our team responded and we quickly rebounded demonstrating greater resiliency that we can build on in 2023. With current freight car velocity around 210 miles per day and trip plan compliance measures demonstrating sequential improvement, we look to maintain that progress as volumes strengthen into 2023. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on slide 12, which continue to trail 2021's results. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance were flat sequentially from last quarter's results. Importantly, however, Intermodal trip plan compliance did improve 11 points sequentially, as supply chain congestion alleviated, resulting in less stack containers at the inland ramps.Near the end of the quarter, we successfully onboarded the Schneider Intermodal business and remain actively engaged to manage that transition. Turning to slide 13 to review our network efficiency metrics, which also like 2021's fourth quarter measures, locomotive productivity, workforce productivity and train length all declined sequentially driven by lower volumes in the back half of the quarter and winter weather challenges. Entering 2023, the team remains focused on strengthening the network while recovering lost productivity. Moving to slide 14, we continue to exercise discipline in our capital spending, while delivering value to our shareholders. We are targeting 2023 capital spending of $3.6 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors.While the projected increase from last year, we expect capital spending to remain in line with our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. As always, our first capital dollars will support our existing infrastructure. This spending will harden our infrastructure, renew older assets and support safe operations. For 2023, in addition to a higher inflationary environment, the elevated capital spending will be driven by increased locomotive spending of $175 million. With 430 modernized locomotives currently in the fleet, we will bring the total modernized to over 1,000 by the end of 2025. These modernizations not only help build resiliency into the network through enhanced reliability and productivity, but also further the progress towards our carbon emission reduction goals.We continue to invest capital for growth. On the Intermodal front, we are investing in additional capacity at the Inland Empire terminal and we will be expanding our footprint in Kansas City. And on the capacity side, we will continue to invest in projects like sidings that drive productivity, allow us to handle more car loadings and improve our network efficiency. Wrapping up on slide 15, we are dedicated to improving our service product in 2023. Slide 15 provides a roadmap of the key activities to achieve that goal. We demonstrated meaningful improvement in our safety results in 2022 through an enhancement to our safety management systems and continue towards the goal of world class safety. Additionally, we recognize the importance of quality of life concerns that our agreement professionals voice.We continue to work closely with union leadership to find win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules. As we sustain improved operational performance, use our resources more efficiently and reduce variability, we will generate productivity. At the same time, technology enhancements will drive further productivity and support a consistent and reliable service product for our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.Jennifer Hamann: Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let's start with fourth quarter income statement on slide 17. Operating revenue in the quarter totaled $6.2 billion, up 8% versus 2021 on a 1% increase in volume. These gains were more than offset by a 14% increase in operating expense, which totaled $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Operating income of $2.4 billion declined 1% versus 2021. Other income remained strong, up 11% to $92 million, driven by higher real estate income and pension benefit, which offset 2021's $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense increased 13% as average debt levels increased more than $3 billion year-over-year.Net income of $1.6 billion declined 4%. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in essentially flat earnings per share at $2.67. Fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% increased 360 basis points, driven by higher inflation and operating costs. Falling fuel prices during the quarter had a favorable 20-basis-point impact. Looking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, slide 18 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared to 2021. Volume contributed 75 basis points. As fuel prices stayed high year-over-year, fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenue also remained elevated, totaling $975 million and increased freight revenue 850 basis points. Strong core pricing gains that exceeded inflation dollars were more than offset by a negative business mix, resulting in a 25-basis-point decline in freight revenue.Fewer forest product shipments combined with higher International Intermodal and rock shipments drove the negative mix. Turning to slide 19 for a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses, the largest driver of the overall expense increase was again fuel, up 43% as fuel prices rose 46%. Combating these higher prices, we continue to drive productivity, improving our fuel consumption rate 2 points to produce a fourth quarter record. Our compensation and benefits expense was up 10% versus 2021. Total fourth quarter workforce levels increased 4%, reflecting our hiring efforts throughout 2022. Cost per employee grew 6%, primarily driven by wage inflation. In addition, cost pressures from network inefficiencies in the form of higher overtime and borrow out costs continued in the quarter.Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 18%, driven by cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume related purchase transportation expense at our loop subsidiary and inflation. Equipment and other rents increased 3%, driven by the impact of slower cycle times on car hire expenses. Other expense was flat in the quarter, as higher travel and casualty expenses were offset by a partial insurance recovery related to 2021 bridge fire, as well as lower state and local taxes. Looking to 2023, we have opportunities across the Board to improve efficiency and that's job one as we recover our service product. Although we still expect to be more than volume variable with our workforce, we will continue to aggressively hire crews in critical locations and to backfill attrition.For 2023, we expect our all-in inflation to be around 4%, while cost per employee is expected to increase in the mid single digits as elevated wage inflation is partially offset by productivity. Depreciation expense should be up around 3% versus 2022 and below the line, similar to last year, we expect other income to remain elevated versus historic levels driven by higher real estate and interest income. Finally, we expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Moving to slide 20 with a quick recap of full year 2022 results, which are shown on the slide as reported and include the impact of the third quarter PEB adjustment. Revenue was up 14%, an annual record, driven by increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and 2% volume growth.Record operating income increased 6% to $9.9 billion, which includes a net increase of just under $700 million from fuel surcharges. Our full year reported operating ratio of 60.1% deteriorated 290 basis points versus 2021. Network inefficiencies and inflation were the primary components of the degradation with the PEB adjustment and higher fuel prices impacting the full year operating ratio by 30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively. Earnings per share finished the year at a record $11.21, a 13% increase versus 2021 results. Our consistent and disciplined approach to deploying capital back into our railroad coupled with volume growth that produced increased operating income drove a 90-basis-point improvement in return on invested capital to a record 17.3%.Turning to shareholder returns on the balance sheet on slide 21, full year cash from operations increased over $300 million to $9.4 billion, a 4% increase from 2021. The first priority for our cash is capital investment, which finished 2022 at $3.4 billion or just under 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate finished 2022 at 82% and free cash flow totaled $2.7 billion. Although a decrease of nearly $800 million versus 2021, that includes an almost $700 million increase in cash capital, a more than $350 million increase in dividend payments and $70 million for PEB back pay settlements. Our dividend payout ratio for 2022 was around 45%, in line with our long-term target, as we rewarded shareholders with a 10% dividend increase in the second quarter and distributed nearly $3.2 billion.We also returned cash through strong share repurchases, buying back 5% or $27 million of our common shares at an all-in cost of $6.3 billion. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $9.4 billion to our owners in 2022, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. We closed out the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings as we finished the year A rated by Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch. Turning now to our view on 2023, we think about the year ahead in two parts, what we can control and what we cannot. We don't control the markets we serve, and as you saw on Kenny's slide of economic indicators, it's a mixed bag in terms of expectations.We do control the way we compete in those markets with the great foundation of the UP franchise. Onboarding Schneider is clearly the marquee win for 2023 and with Kenny's team posting profitable wins across the Board, we are positioned to further outperform the market. In 2023, that will be evidenced by car loadings that exceed Industrial production. Another area where we don't have direct control is the current inflationary environment, which continues to be elevated. However, we know we have it within our control to improve operations. As you heard from Eric, it's imperative that we improve the reliability of our service product, while regaining lost productivity. In addition, as we have demonstrated consistently, we expect to generate pricing dollars that exceed inflation dollars in 2023.Assuming current fuel prices and our thoughts on volume, productivity and price, we expect to improve our full year 2023 operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. That said, there will be a lag to fully offset the impact of inflation on our profitability until we are able to actively touch or re-price our business while also further improving productivity. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to make significant investments into our business with an expected 6% increase in capital investments versus 2022 to $3.6 billion. Growth is the cornerstone to the long-term financial success of Union Pacific and we are continuing to invest in opportunities that support that strategy. In addition to the locomotive and Intermodal investments Eric described, we also are investing to support carload growth.The remainder of our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout of around 45% and returning excess cash through share repurchases. With our balance sheet currently leveraged at the desired levels, the amount of cash available for repurchases will be less than in prior years and predominantly funded from cash generation. With the New Year comes new opportunities and by focusing on what we can control, we are confident in our ability to provide strong value to all of our stakeholders in 2023. So, with that, I will turn it back to Lance.Lance Fritz: Thank you, Jennifer. Let's wrap up on slide 24. We made great strides on personal safety in 2022 and it's imperative we continue that momentum. The commitment made by our employees to care for one another has been exceptional, resulting in our best employee safety metrics in five years. We look to further translate these gains into better derailment performance in the upcoming year. We understand that safety is about culture and it's about engagement, listening to and responding to our employees needs and ideas will continue to improve our safety performance. Our robust hiring pipeline and improving network fluidity strengthen crew availability. That leads to a more efficient and better service product that enables us to recapture lost productivity.Over the past couple of years, we have demonstrated our commitment to customer-centered growth as reflected in business development wins, and while growth in 2023 may be challenging given the uncertainty of the economic backdrop, we will continue to make strategic capital investments in support of our long-term growth objectives. Our fundamentals for long-term success have not changed, powered by our best-in-industry employees and franchise, a strategy built for profitable growth and a more efficient and reliable service product, Union Pacific is poised to do great things in 2023 and we are ready to prove it. So, with that, let's open up the line for your questions.See also 10 Best Healthcare Stocks for the Long Term and 18 Countries that Produce the Most Nuclear Energy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Investors can identify these types of stocks by analyzing financial indicators such as return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, and earnings volatility. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ on November 14, 2022. The analyst said the markets have already priced in a modest recession in earnings and 2023 could see high dollar strength, China reopening, and inflation peaking as consumer spending rises in China and the rest of the world. He believes in this situation, investors should pick up higher quality stocks. On August 16, 2022, Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab told CNBC that investors should seek factors such as positive earnings revisions, profitability, strong free cash flow, and healthy balance sheets with high cash and low debt when approaching the market in the presently volatile macro environment. She also advised investors to exit from market segments that have low returns and pile into sectors that have higher returns. Investors can also check out 11 Best Quality Stocks To Buy, 10 Best Stocks in Each Sector, and 11 Best Sectors To Invest In for a well-rounded market outlook.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”10.

Shares of Moderna, a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics, declined due to increasing uncertainty around what a booster market could look like as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market rather than government funded.”9.

(NYSE:AIG).AIG reported strong Q2 earnings, but volatile capital markets led to delays in the IPO of the company’s life and retirement business and concerns about the quality of the company’s investment portfolio. We continue to believe AIG has one of the best management teams in the industry, and they’ve been executing well on turning the business around and improving underwriting and expense control.”8.

Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”7. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 25: 6.72Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52P/E Ratio as of January 25: 10.33EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was incorporated in 1985 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

(NYSE:EOG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) (+36%), was among our top contributors in the quarter as oil prices rallied due to tight supplies, which were then exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Low Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks To Buy15 Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stocks Disclosure: None. 15 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 points to a change of +5.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.82 indicates a change of +7.7% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $13.43 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $54.47 billion and $56.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.6% and +3.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.86 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.32%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As the name suggests, these publicly traded securities offer regular passive income payouts with dividends (typically on a quarterly basis). Fundamentally, this financial category enables market participants to have their money work for them rather than the other way around.In addition, unlike risk-on growth-oriented enterprises, the price action for shares of passive income providers tends to be more resilient to fluctuations. Of course, this framework prevents truly outstanding upside potential. But in an ecosystem that might turn deflationary because of frequent interest rate hikes, stability commands a premium. With so many variables to account for the in the post-pandemic new normal, it’s wise to own established enterprises. Below are the best income stocks to buy in Jan.FASTFastenal$48.99JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$168.31CSCOCisco$47.50TXNTexas Instruments$178.17UPSUnited Parcel Service$180.48RHIRobert Half$79.75TROWT.

As well, the company offers various services, including inventory management. Admittedly boring, Fastenal benefits from an established business, providing seemingly mundane equipment for various industrial needs. Thus, it makes an ideal play for best income stocks to buy.Currently, Fastenal enjoys solid financials across the board. For instance, the company’s Altman Z-Score hits 15.23, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. As well, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.68 times, well above the sector median of 0.46 times. Operationally, Fastenal’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) pings at 6.4%, above nearly 62% of its rivals. More impressively, the company’s net margin is 15.7%, ranked better than 96% of sector players.Story continuesFinally, Fastenal carries a forward yield of 2.86%. Combined with its 24 years of consecutive dividend increases, FAST represents one of the best income stocks to buy.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comHealthcare and consumer products stalwart Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) needs no introduction. Though it courted various controversies over the past few years, the brand carries tremendous global recognition. Further, during these difficult times, investors may view JNJ as a reliable canvas. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the best income stocks to buy this month.Mainly, Johnson &amp; Johnson enjoys solid all-around financials. On the balance sheet, the company’s Altman Z-Score of 4.78 reflects a business enterprise safe from bankruptcy risk. But JNJ really comes alive in the bottom line. From gross to operating to net margins, each of these metrics rank among the industry’s top echelon. Moreover, the healthcare giant’s return on equity (ROE) of 25.9% reflects superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits.Notably, Wall Street analysts rate JNJ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target also implies potential upside of over 12%. Finally, JNJ carries a forward yield of 2.68%, higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%.Cisco (CSCO)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational technology conglomerate, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another powerful name that needs no introduction. Undergirding the communication and security networks of some of the biggest enterprises in the world, Cisco represents a mature business. In that sense, it’s an ideal candidate for best income stocks to buy. It’s entrenched in high-barrier-to-competition arena, allowing it to focus on its shareholders.That’s exactly what Cisco does. At the moment, the company carries a forward yield of 3.25%, conspicuously above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Notably, its payout ratio sits at 39.79%, which is fairly low. This metric provides confidence that the company can continue offering passive income to stakeholders without a glitch. As well, it enjoys 12 years of consecutive dividend increases.Fiscally, Cisco benefits from a stable balance sheet (strong cash-to-debt ratio) and excellent profitability margins. Moreover, bargain hunters will appreciate that the market prices CSCO at 13.2-times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 15.1 times.Texas Instruments (TXN)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOn the riskier side of the spectrum regarding best income stocks to buy, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits. Of course, because of the global supply chain crisis imposing severe disruption to the tech space, TXN incurred slow price action following the culmination of its post-pandemic bull rally.Still, for the adventurous type, TXN might be worth a look for best income stocks to buy. Primarily, the company provides decent passive income with a forward yield of 2.87%. As well, it commands 19 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, a status management won’t give up too cheaply. And while the payout ratio of 57.69% is elevated, it’s not to the point of raising serious sustainability concerns.Financially, investors have a lot to love about Texas Instruments. First, its Altman Z-Score hits 13.33, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. On the bottom line, the company enjoys outstanding profitability metrics, along with a stratospheric ROE.United Parcel Service (UPS)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockOn surface level, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) represents a significant risk. While shares did lose nearly 12% of equity value in the trailing year, that’s just part of the anxieties. Perhaps most notably, UPS faces competition from certain e-commerce firms. As well, when you’re dealing with courier services, you must factor in consumer sentiment. Well, this stat stinks, to put it bluntly.So, why mention UPS as one of the best income stocks to buy? When you consider the company objectively, it’s difficult to ignore the holistic value proposition. First, it features a decent balance sheet with an Altman Z-Score rating up in the safe zone. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate (per share) stands at 10.3%, well above the sector median of 1%. And it also enjoys a solid 11% net margin.In terms of passive income, UPS offers a forward yield of 3.41%, well above the industrials sector’s average yield of 2.36%. As well, it features a decently reliable payout ratio of 48.53%.Robert Half (RHI)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockWith the last two entries for best income stocks to buy, we’re going to dial up the risk-reward profile, beginning with employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI). Before anyone gets any strange ideas, RHI presents significant risks. In the trailing year, shares stumbled over 28%. However, in the year so far, Robert Half gained over 6% of equity value.Fundamentally, it’s possible that RHI may benefit (cynically, I might add) from mass layoffs.
