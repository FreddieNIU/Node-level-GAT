', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.', 'Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.', 'In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.', ""One stock to keep an eye on is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.07. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.89.

Over the past 52 weeks, UNM's PEG has been as high as 0.94 and as low as 0.63, with a median of 0.78."", ""Another valuation metric that we should highlight is UNM's P/B ratio of 1.02. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.77. Within the past 52 weeks, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.07 and as low as 0.83, with a median of 0.97."", ""Value investors also use the P/S ratio.

While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.', 'Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.', 'P/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.', 'It is calculated as below:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH, Ford Motor Company F and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 11 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

Linda, please go ahead."", 'Linda Tharby', ""Thank you, Louisa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During today's call, we will use slides to support our commentary. I will begin by walking through our results and key business updates for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Tom will then review our financials and our 2024 guidance. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions. I'm very pleased with Core's performance in the fourth quarter. We continued to execute on our growth strategy, exceeded our gross margin expectations and with discipline in our capital and expense management, we continued to see improvements in our quarterly cash burn. Our full year revenues ended at $28.5 million with growth of 2% affected by a one-time nonrecurring engineering services revenue in our Novel Therapies business. Our overall revenue growth in our core SCIG. business remained strong with U.S. performance driven by share gains and with the overall SCG IG market recovering in another quarter of sequential growth. In our international business, we delivered double-digit growth year over year, primarily driven by deeper penetration in current markets and successful entry into new geographies, supported by strong IG supply. In November, we announced FDA clearance of the 50 Atmel central prefilled syringes for the core Freedom system. Prefilled syringes are becoming an increasingly large part of the SCIG. market and Coral is strongly positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. We believe propels will be a critical growth driver for Corio and expand our penetration in our core markets and novel therapies. We continue to build out the pipeline having signed three additional collaborations in 23 and having started the year strong with two new in the beginning of 2024 both of which I will touch on later. From an operational perspective, I'll let Tom cover the financials with more granularity for gross margins, we finished above 60% for the second consecutive quarter. We generated positive cash flow of $700,000 in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we exceeded our 2023 ending cash balance projections closing the year with $11.5 million. Each of these metrics serves as a testament to the steps we've taken in our operating expense management and inventory reduction initiatives, and we expect to continue to progression in operating performance in 2024 and beyond. Finally, we are initiating 2024 guidance for net revenues to range between $31.2 million and $32.2 million, representing 10% to 13% growth and gross margin between 59% to 61% for the full year. Additionally, we plan to exit the year with an ending cash balance of at least $8 million and to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of 24 and for the full year 2025. Tom will discuss details related to the guidance and our associated assumptions later in the call over the last few years. We've invested in positioning Qorvo for growth and profitability. And as we enter 24, we expect much of that investment is behind us. I'm seeing strong momentum in our core business our best novel therapies pipeline to date and a focused operational discipline that is critical to our future success. 2024 will be an execution year for our team, and we believe we are poised for a return to sustained double-digit growth and profitability. Vision 26 remains our key focus moving forward, and we are positioned for a meaningful inflection point and 24 and beyond. Moving to slide 4, you'll recognize the three pillar growth strategy that is the foundation of our Vision 26 initiative. Those three being domestic SCIG. penetration and growth. The broadening of our novel therapies pipeline and geographic expansion strategy will continue to position Qorvo as a leader in the growing large volume subcutaneous drug delivery market as it relates to our domestic core, our goal is to increase penetration into the SCIG. markets and further establish our leadership position with respect to the overall SCIG. market. In the fourth quarter, we saw another quarter of sequential growth in patient volume and the market ended the year with mid to high single digit growth. We delivered approximately 6% year over year revenue growth and our end-user sales to pharmacies were up double digits, reflective of share gains. Our distributor inventories were lower at the end of Q4, and we expect to see this inventory replenished in future quarters. Increased demand for pumps drove a double-digit increase in volumes for both the fourth quarter and the full year often a leading indicator to consumable sales. We continue to see caregivers and patients drive therapy to pre-filled devices or convenience versus traditional SCIG. BiDil therapy. We're encouraged by these trends and believe this will benefit the commercial launch of the 50 ML. has entered a prefilled syringe, which began rollout in January. We also anticipate a new five 10 K submission for a product in the fourth quarter 2024 within core IG. Overall, we are increasingly confident in the SCIG. market growth, driving new patient starts and believe we are positioned for continuing share gains in our U.S. business in 2024. Turning to novel therapies. We have 15 collaborations signed to date with 19 additional open opportunities across varying indications signing new three new collaborations in 2023. I'm encouraged by our progress in early 24. In recent weeks, we've announced two new collaborations, which I will discuss later. We also have two drug collaborations progressing to Phase three trials in 2024, a key milestone in the advancement commercial launch. Looking forward during the fourth quarter of 24, we're anticipating a submission of a five tenant Applica K application to support a new novel therapy indication for use with our Freedom infusion system in ambulatory infusion centers. I'm very pleased by the headway we're making within NT. by the overall strength and diversity of our pipeline and the progress on commercialized drugs in early 25 and 26 Turning to international core, it continues to be a great opportunity for KORU. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 8% over Q4 22% and 10% for the full year. Strong sales growth was driven by growth in our established markets as IG supply stabilized new indication growth and CIDPSID. and entry into multiple new markets as was the case in domestic core pump and consumable volumes with another strong indicator of demand with double digit growth. Our excitement in international is at an all-time high as we anticipate continued expansion into new regions in 2024. We also expect the completion of an electronic pump trial in the first half of the year, generating further evidence for our Freedom infusion systems. I'd like to shift our focus back to the IG market on slide 5 and more specifically pre-filled syringes and why we're so bullish on the opportunities this presents for core and move forward. Presales represent a major catalyst for growth within our domestic and international core markets as this delivery method is increasingly penetrating share among subcutaneous therapy patients and has the potential to increase overall subcu penetration. Prefilled syringe patients grew 20.5% in the fourth quarter and increased overall penetration to 14% as the fastest growing part of the overall IG market. Overall, we see a number of factors that will continue to drive growth. First, patient preference was 78% of patients preferring the use of PROPEL with the Freedom pump versus bile ADMINISTRATION. Additionally, the 50 ML. dose clearance represents two thirds of the prefilled market and combined with the earlier 20 ML. launch provides core with a broad portfolio to fulfill all patient needs. We've been focused with our pharmaceutical partners and driving clinical practice change to prefilled, driving even greater uptake in usage due to the increased convenience, we expect increased penetration with CIDP. patients who require much higher doses and twice weekly therapy. We are excited by our position and potential for prebuilds to drive growth and higher penetration, reaching levels of [2020 to] 25% for portfolio penetration in '24 and 50% by the end of year '25. Turning to slide 6, we are very pleased to announce that we will presenting new data at the 2024 National Home Infusion Association Conference later this month. This study focused on patient adherence to the Freedom systems and collected data from over 11,000 patients with primary immune deficiencies self-administered their SCIG. therapy using the core Freedom pump. This retrospective study conducted over a 4.5 year period, revealed an impressive adherence rate of 97% to the prescribed treatment protocol. To provide context, adherence rates for other chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, arthritis and diabetes range, somewhere from 62% to 87%. This comparison highlights the exceptional poor performance of the core Freedom pump system and promoting treatment consistency and improving patient satisfaction. Overall, these findings underscore the effectiveness of the core Freedom pump system in facilitating strong adherence to SCIG. therapy among PID. patients leading to improved treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction. We look forward to sharing these results at the upcoming NHI. conference with our process prospectively customers. Turning to our novel therapies pipeline. We have the strongest pipeline we have reported to date. In 2023, we added three new collaborations to our pipeline, bringing our total collaborations to 15 and we are pursuing another 19 open opportunities. This NT pipeline translates to a total addressable market of approximately $2.7 billion through the treatment of over 1.6 million people globally, 2024 is already off to a strong start. And I want to highlight the two recent club collaborations. We've announced the first being the initiation of a feasibility study with Chorus system on an already commercialized rare disease therapy and the second, a clinical supply agreement to support a pre-commercial unnamed SCIG. drug entering it Phase three trials. Novel therapies is a key piece to Qorvo's growth strategy as it creates opportunities for future drug indications that can grow our core business significantly once commercialized. We also anticipate entry in Japan with increasing SCIG. approvals. Our team is focused on late stage drug opportunities with potential for commercialization over the next three years in both the home and ambulatory infusion set in the near term targets or those collaborations we expect to go live with Q2 totaling six new potential entries by the end of 26 are highlighted in the lighter green on the far right of the slide. I'm encouraged by the incremental advancement in our funnel and truly believe that novel therapies will be transformational to increasing our leader position leadership position as a global leader in large-volume drug delivery and driving our commercial potential in our core business. In 2023, we've laid the foundation for a strong 24, and we're on a path to continued double-digit growth with a clear line of sight to profitability in 25. I'm excited by our current momentum as we remain focused on the execution of our vision 26 strategy and positioning Qorvo for continued growth and profitability. I will now turn it over to Tom to review our financials."", 'Tom Adams', ""Thank you, Linda, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed the quarter with a total net revenue of $7.2 million, which was below the prior year by 2%. We were pleased with our quarterly performance in our domestic and international core business. For the quarter, we reported domestic core revenues of $5.6 million, reflecting 5% year over year growth. This growth was driven by share gains in new accounts, double digit growth in infusion pump sales and an overall healthy SCIG. market. In addition, and as Linda pointed out, the end user sales, which are indicative of our demand, were very strong during the quarter, which we expect to be reflected in future replenishments of distributor inventory. International core business increased 8% year over year with revenues of $1.3 million, driven by improved IG supply across Europe, expansion into new geographies and double digit growth in pumps and consumable volumes. Our novel therapies business reported revenues of $200,000 or a 62% decrease, driven by a large revenue milestone we completed for nonrecurring engineering services in 2022. Moving to Slide 9. For the full year 2023, total net revenues were $28.5 million, increasing 2% over the prior year. Domestic core sales totaled $22.4 million, which was a 6% year over year increase driven by growth in pumps and consumables attributed to share gains in national and regional accounts. 2023 also marked a record year in infusion pump unit sales. With this growth, we expect our consumables revenue to follow as our pumps make it into the hands of nursing patients. International core revenues were $4.6 million, representing a 10% increase compared to the prior year. Growth internationally was driven by increased sales in established markets as well as expansion into new geographies. Novel Therapies revenues were $1.5 million were up, reflecting a decrease of 41% in the year. The decline was a result of higher NRE recognized and increased clinical trial orders from the prior year. We carry revenue potential from a number of pipeline opportunities into 2024. Moving on to gross margins in Slide 10. For the fourth quarter, we delivered GAAP gross margins of 60.3%, which was a 470 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 63.1%. The non-GAAP gross margin allowed for a one-time inventory adjustment related to a product discontinuation that had no impact on revenue margin improvements in the quarter were driven by increases in manufacturing efficiencies related to a site closure outsourcing of consumable manufacturing and favorable changes in product mix. For the full year 2023 GAAP gross margin was 58.6%, a 350 basis point improvement over the full year of 2022, which was driven primarily by our outsourcing efforts and improvements in manufacturing, productivity and product mix. Non-gaap gross margin for the year was 59.6%, which allowed again for a one-time adjustment for our product discontinuation. On Slide 11. At the end of the fourth quarter, we finished the year with a cash balance of $11.5 million representative of a $700,000 cash gain for the quarter. Our Q4 cash improvement was driven by lower losses from the second half of 2023, driven by improved gross margin and disciplined operating expense control. Additionally, there was an increase in CapEx in the quarter on tooling related to the development of our next-generation products. Offsetting these uses of cash, we achieved significant working capital improvement led by the completion of our inventory reduction plan, collection of earned retention credits and typical year-end accruals. During the fourth quarter, we also recorded a noncash valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. Yes, as we review our cash usage by quarter, we improved directionally throughout 2023. The first quarter had a higher level of spending as a result of onetime investments in CapEx and onboarding of new hires, which tapered off significantly accrued throughout the year. Moving into 2024, we expect quarterly cash usage to remain consistent to follow a similar cadence, but at a significantly lower burn rate. As Linda noted earlier, given our improved operating leverage and our planned reduce cash usage, we expect to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full year 2025. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.5 million or negative $0.16 per diluted share compared to a net loss $2 million or negative $0.04 per diluted share for the same period of 2022. Net loss for the full year 2023 was $13.7 million or negative $0.30 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $8.7 million or negative $0.19 per diluted share for the same period of 22. Our net loss and EPS for both the quarter and the full year included a tax valuation allowance of $6 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $1 million or negative $0.02 per diluted share versus negative $1.6 million or negative $0.04 in the prior year. And adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $6 million negative or negative $0.13 per diluted share versus negative $6.1 million or negative $0.14 from the prior year. Moving on to slide 13, we are setting our revenue guidance for the full year of 2024 between $31.2 million and $32.2 million, representing roughly a 10% to 13% growth. Key drivers behind these estimates included one core SCIG. drug market growth in the mid to high single digits. The second, adding three new collaborations to novel therapies pipeline and third, prefilled syringe penetration of approximately 20% to 25% of the overall SCIG. market. We expect gross margins to range between 59% to 61%, primarily as a result of geographic expansion into lower ASP markets, supply chain, inflationary pressure and start-up costs for a new production line in the second half of the year. Finally, we expect our 2024 and the cash balance to be greater than $8 million, implying a significant cash burn decrease from prior year's assumptions for this guidance are driven by managing operating expenses of approximately $23.5 million to $24 million exclusive of stock compensation expenses. We also are expecting cash flow to break even in Q4 and to be cash flow positive for the full year of 2024. Finally, our cash guidance I just mentioned is exclusive of our new $10 million credit facility. Our new credit facility consists of a $5 million line of credit at a $5 million term loan with HSBC USA, with which we have established a new commercial banking relationships. We are pleased to have this new reserve available to us for strategic growth capital opportunities. I will now turn the call back to Linda for closing comments."", 'Linda Tharby', ""Thanks, Tom. In the last several years. We've invested in R&D pipeline and new product innovation to drive increased market penetration, share gains and accelerated growth. As we discussed, we have received FDA approval for the 50m el-hi Xandra on our Freedom 60 platform, which will aid in expanding our customer base. In the near term, we expect a five 10 K submission for our new infusion set, which will provide a more comfortable and convenient experience and our next-generation infusion pump for IG. In the longer term, we expect to pump platform for novel therapies that will be customizable to the pharmaceutical partners' needs. We are very excited to bring each of these products to market as we look to assist both customers and pharmaceutical drug manufacturers and providing the best subcutaneous infusion experience patients. In closing, we have a few key milestones that I would like to highlight for 2024. Within our financial and operational performance, we anticipate returning to double digit net revenue growth versus full year 23. We look to accelerate our US core share gains through increased penetration of 50m L. prefilled syringes. We'll also continuing our international expansion in current and new markets. On the novel therapies front, we expect to enter three new collaborations in the year, focusing on late-stage candidates that have a higher probabilities of reaching commercialization prior to 2026, we are projecting the submission of two five 10 10-K's, one for new products and the other for a new drug indication on the Freedom platform. Finally, it is our commitment to breakeven cash flows in Q4 24 and cash flow positive for full year 2025. Each of these milestones are strong indicators of the progress we are making toward Qorvo's overarching vision 26 goals. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and 22 results, and I'm strongly encouraged by our strategic outlook across all of our businesses heading into 24, we continue to strive to evolve our company to a leader in drug delivery in both the clinic and at home setting through the convenience of our products as demonstrated by our long term plan and milestones for the year. In closing, I would like to thank the entire Qorvo team for their continued passion and dedication. Operator, I will now turn the call over to you for Q&A for a question and answer session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Frank Takkinen, Lake Street Capital.', 'Frank Takkinen', 'Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on all the progress and the strong start to the year. I was hoping to start with one on guidance. I saw I saw and heard the comments around some of your assumptions about SISCIG. market growth, novel therapies, pre-filled syringe penetration. I was hoping you could kind of break it down by line item, maybe domestic international and novel therapies. How should we think about the growth profile, the guide for 2024. And then to add on to that, how should we think about the contribution from the high center 50 ML.', 'Linda Tharby', ""Okay I think I got it all, but I'll start and then turn it over to Tom first on. Yes, our overall performance, $31.2 million to $32.2 million expectation for 2024. We do not guide by business, but let me give you a couple of the key points. In our U.S. business, we would anticipate the market overall to grow somewhere in that 7.5% range. And we expect our performance to be a couple of points above that, driven by share gain, primarily prefilled syringe, prefilled syringe and increasing prefilled penetration, particularly in the CIDP. patient base, our international performance, you can expect so that in the US business is a nice acceleration from where we ended this year and on our overall international business, we would expect the overall year in our international business to be up appreciably from where we ended this year, probably think about a growth trajectory somewhere in the 15% to 20% range. And then finally, off for our novel therapies business, we would say overall you can expect that business somewhere between the $1.5 million and $2 million mark overall in the year."", 'Frank Takkinen', ""Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up to one of the earlier PRs from this week on the ambulatory infusion setting. Maybe talk about that specific opportunity and extend that into kind of how you think about the ambulatory infusion market as an overall opportunity going forward?"", 'Linda Tharby', ""Yes. So ambulatory infusion centers just to set the stage, there are a market that exists between the hospital and the home setting where drugs there have been eight new drugs launched in the last three years, which require administration by healthcare professionals in that setting. And as I noted in our Investor Day, that was a key area of progress for us because the drugs are already commercialized. So I'm very excited that we were able to finalize this deal, announced it in the first quarter for a drug asset that is already commercialized in those settings. And on top of that, that asset will use a customized CORAL platform and we anticipate that we will file a five 10 K for that in the US, followed by ex U.S. geographies. We continue to see the infusion centers as being an opportunity for incremental growth of a new area that represents near term commercial potential. And just overall very very excited about the opportunity. We have several more that we are focused on in our pipeline and hopefully more to report in the coming quarters."", 'Operator', 'Alex Nowak, Craig-Hallum Capital.', 'Alex Nowak', ""Okay, great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe to follow up around the core business for Karru. We've spoken a lot about the 50 milliliter prefilled launch, but I'm curious, I've been seeing a lot of TV ads on CIDP. recently. So are we seeing a bigger uptake in that part of the market than maybe we would have thought where your what are your thoughts there?"", 'Linda Tharby', 'Yes. So currently, the of our total user base CIDP. would account for about 10% of our total user base and is only today about 10% penetrated into SCIG. therapies. So this is a major focus of all of the SCIG players to convert them from IV to SCIG therapy. With the advancements of prefilled, because of that convenience, about 80% of patients prefer these and the very large doses that they require. This is a significant opportunity to take that 10% penetration level and grow it to levels that are similar. For example, in PID., we would see about 50% penetration in that patient base. So overall, CIDP. in the coming years is a significant area of growth. And speaking to our customers, they are reporting daily patients coming in asking and being converted with doc prescriptions to go from IV to subcu therapy. So very excited overall for the opportunity.', 'Alex Nowak', 'Okay. Got it. So certainly the pre-fill, the 50 milliliter prefilled is going to be very helpful whether it be PIDD. or CIDP. So that makes total sense. What do you need for crew to get ready to help the cadence their launch in Japan?', 'Linda Tharby', ""An approval by the regulatory bodies. We've been waiting for this one. Yes. So as you know, we submitted that file some time and we continue to progress commercial discussions with all of the pharmaceutical partners for that entry so we are excited and it's just a regulatory approval is what we need."", 'Alex Nowak', ""Okay. Got it. And then a clarification. And then just one more question on three new collaborations was mentioned in the prepared remarks, a couple of times, do you mean three new collaborations in total for 2024 or three more than what we've already been or that started with announced so far up until now?"", 'Linda Tharby', ""Yes, that is three in total, which would include the two we've already announced. And what I would say is we have a lot of work to do on the 15 that are already in the pipeline on these generally start with feasibility. Many of them involve innovation agreements. They then go into clinical trial approvals. So a lot of work to do in there, but three is a number we obviously hope to exceed that number. But the three is what we're counting on for our guidance. Right now. So obviously decided that we have two of those out of the way a couple of months in here."", 'Alex Nowak', 'Yeah, makes total sense. And then just lastly, 2024 it should be a good year and should be building up into, I think, a very strong 2025. If you put together the core IG business, Takeda Japan launched the 50 milliliter prefilled, the rare disease launch. What is a realistic view on what the longer term growth can start to look like for Kearl? Is the growth there providing the 2024 number, the longer term growth or can we get above that?', 'Linda Tharby', ""I would say thank you because you just named off all of the key areas that we're looking at right now. And I would say in addition to that, continued strength in the IG market, our share gains here in the U.SBNT. progression and successful commercial entries all of which I laid out today, six shots on goal, you know, coming into 25 and 26 and then incremental expansion internationally, that's become a real driver for us. So overall, we believe our numbers can be 20%, 25%-plus . Growth is what we're looking at for 25 and beyond a little bit stronger. Sorry, the only thing I missed was new products, obviously, those new products launching add to that share gain perspective."", 'Operator', 'Caitlin Cronin, Canaccord Genuity.', 'Caitlin Cronin', 'Thanks for taking the question. Just to start off with 2024 guidance, what does that really imply from a quarterly cadence prospective for both revenue and gross margin.', 'Linda Tharby', ""Maybe I'll let Tom handle that question."", 'Tom Adams', ""Sure. So we typically don't guide by quarter one, but you can expect increasing revenues. It's through throughout the quarter. And I would say that on a novel therapy side, as you know, that business is rather lumpy and revenue is reflective as work is performed and milestones were completed. But I would say on the core side, that's more of an increasing type of revenue that you can model out. And then in terms of gross margin, yes, I mean gross margin there's three things that are that are that are impacting the year. And the first thing is we are launching new products and we are ramping up our facilities in the second half of the year. And when you do that, you typically have some inefficiencies within manufacturing as you start up a new facility. Again, that's the second half of the year. And then I'm I would say also with that, we are growing. We are growing internationally and those ASPs are generally at a lower ASP than what you'd see in the US market so I would say all in all, you can you can you can you can model out of gross margin that would be pretty consistent with maybe a little bit of a drop in the Q3 time line and then a bounce back up in Q4."", 'Linda Tharby', ""Caitlin, maybe the only additional thing that I would add to what Tom had to say as you would expect that our quarterly revenues would follow prior year patterns. We typically tend to have a stronger Q1 generally driven by new insurance where people switch providers and wells. We'll get new pumps and or new consumables with that provider."", 'Caitlin Cronin', 'Got it. Okay. And then just on gross margin again or the supply chain inflationary pressures that you noted in the press release. Are these Now are these just the pressures that have been going on for some time and you look at them --', 'Tom Adams', ""I'd say, a combination of, as you know, inflation has not gone away, it's still out there. And so we still we still anticipate some pricing pressure from some of our vendors. And also we just completed our budget and typically a lot of our new contracts they renew in the first quarter. So there are there are some some pricing increases up from those renewals that were we're working with."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Jason Bednar, Piper Sandler.', 'Jason Bednar', ""Good afternoon for taking the questions here. I'm going to maybe follow up on some items that have been touched on, but just help us unpack a few things a bit more and Kevin's question there and cadence, you know, maybe a face putting that together with the prior question around acceleration to 25. I mean it would seem like your comps first half versus second half. You should have an acceleration first half second half and the growth rate this year. So and to that, we're not looking at such a large step up in the growth rate heading into 25 so I guess is that the right way to think about it on that side? And then, Tom, on your gross margin points there and again, was Kevin's question on the supply chain costs thinking a little bit higher. Is this do we need to have like a little bit of a downshift in how you're thinking about gross margins in your 26 plan. Are those incremental to that 26 plan? Or are those contemplated within there? Just trying to understand if anything's changed."", 'Tom Adams', ""Yes. So let me start with the gross margin. Since we were just on that topic, I would say that there are some one-time gross margin impacts. Again, as I mentioned, the starting up of a new production line. It definitely creates inefficiencies when you do that measure, train our volumes from one site to the other. So that's that's one piece that I would imagine would will resolve itself in future periods after this year. And then just in terms of your question around the revenue growth, sure, we will see increasing and we will see as we have seen the proof of the fruit the prefilled syringes uptick over the quarters, we will see upticks. We also will see we are expecting approval for them for the Japanese market. And there are some other drivers that are that are included in the back half of the year, which will help which will help our revenue."", 'Linda Tharby', 'And maybe the only other thing I would add to that is you could given the revenues we carried in on novel therapies this year, you can expect a more even cadence and our novel therapies revenues throughout the year. They will not be as back-end loaded as what we anticipated last year because of what we carried into this year.', 'Jason Bednar', ""Okay. Got it. I wanted to shift gears. I don't think it's been touched on yet. Apologies if I missed it, but you mentioned your PR today and assessment report from your European notified body. What does this mean for your European business? And does it affect at all your ability to sell in that market or to get products approved in that market. When do you expect to hear an update from BSI.? Just anything additional there because again, it could be important just hard to tell if it is or not."", 'Linda Tharby', ""Yes, no, thank you for the question, Jason. So let me start by saying that we are currently certified for sale in the EU. So so no issue there on every year you go through an annual recertification process. They were in RBSI. as our auditor they were in February at which we had zero nonconformance. So that's awesome in our manufacturing and quality systems. And we had one open technical file on one product and they recommended we had submitted our response to that open file to BSI. And we had been informed by them that they would come back with questions. And for that the file was closed. That was in March of 2023. So we were quite surprised when we got this report last week saying that they were not recommending our recertification due to this one product and open technical file. We have launched an appeal as of last evening. They came back and acknowledged that they have received that appeal and we expect to resolve this in cooperation with them in the coming months, we expect little to no interruption in our sales in the European market. Our premium products have continued to remain certified marketed and sold in the US."", 'Jason Bednar', ""Okay. All right. That's helpful. I mean, one day, I guess I don't want to throw a worst case of just so we're prepared. I mean, what's that the best case as we come back and where you can, there's like no impact whatsoever are it's de minimus or what's what's worst case here, just the gas that we can prepare accordingly?"", 'Linda Tharby', ""Yes. Great. Great question. So So best case is that there is no interruption at all. We are well, we well, we work through this situation. Any product that we have in the market, we can continue to sell. So so that that's best case and worst case, what I would say is worst case would be that they say we are not if they stand by their original ARM and do not accept our appeal. Again, I feel that's highly unlikely given what we've sent them on their prior communication to us, which is that's why we're appealing. But if they decide to uphold that, then I would say it would take us several months to resolve. We feel we can resolve it on our end and several months. We feel it may take them some time to review the file. So you take all of those things into impact. I would say the worst case scenario would be several months of not supply. I would cap that at probably three, three, three months and Europe I've known supply."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Linda for any closing remarks.', 'Linda Tharby', 'In closing, I just want to say thank you to the KORU team and to all of our investors for the continued progress in 2023, and we look forward to have a great year in 2024. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.""]"

While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.', 'Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.', 'P/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.', 'It is calculated as below:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH, Ford Motor Company F and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 11 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

Diverse revenue streams and rising fee income are likely to support top-line growth. However, an escalating expense base and a concentrated loan portfolio are concerns.U.S. Bancorp witnessed strong growth in total loans and deposits over the past few years on the back of sustained client acquisition and deepened relationships with existing clients. Total deposits and loans saw a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.1% and 6% over the four years (2019-2023), respectively. Though the trend for loans reversed in 2023, attributed to subdued demand and payoffs, management expects strengthened loan pipelines in commercial and the credit card space to drive loan growth in the upcoming period.Organic growth and diversified revenue streams are key strengths of U.S. Bancorp. Revenues demonstrated a CAGR of 10.4% over the last four years (ended 2023), primarily driven by higher NII. Investment portfolio repositioning, improved loan demand and lower deposit migration are likely to bolster NII going forward. The company expects first-quarter 2024 NII to be in the range of $4-$4.1 billion.Moreover, USB’s efforts to expand its product and service offerings are expected to aid fee income growth. The bank is well-poised to improve its revenue trend in the upcoming period. Management projects adjusted fee revenues to grow in the mid-single digit range this year.As of Dec 31, 2023, U.S. Bancorp’s long-term debt was $51.48 billion, and cash and due from banks was $16.19 billion, reflecting solid liquidity. The bank enjoys long-term investment grade ratings of A, A+ and A3 from Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Moody’s, respectively.\xa0 This enables USB’s accessibility to debt markets at favorable rates. Given the impressive earnings strength and decent cash levels, the bank is likely to meet its debt obligations and exhibit low credit risk in the event of economic turmoil.However, an escalating expense base remains a challenge. U.S Bancorp’s non-interest expenses witnessed a 10% CAGR over the last four years (2019-2023). Higher merger and integration charges, compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expenses, as well as technology and communications expenditures, were the primary cost drivers. The company expects the expense base to remain flattish in 2024. Yet, technology-led initiatives are likely to elevate the cost base, which, in turn, would impede bottom-line expansion.As of Dec 31, 2023, 50% of USB’s loan portfolio consisted of total commercial loans (commercial and commercial real estate lending). The rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment might put some pressure on commercial lending. Furthermore, asset quality might deteriorate, given an economic downturn.

These issues, combined with the emissions generated from transporting garments and fabrics supplied offshore, have created demand for more sustainable apparel manufacturing supply chain solutions.', '""At Walmart, we are laser-focused on bringing innovation to our supply chain to better serve our customers and solve industry challenges, and unspun has the potential to do just that,"" said Andrea Albright, executive vice president, Sourcing, Walmart.

With 3D weaving, yarn is spun directly into completed garments. This is an innovative and new approach to garment manufacturing. Traditionally, yarn is woven into one-dimensional fabrics, which are then cut and assembled into garments – creating waste and taking significant time and multiple manufacturing steps. The 3D weaving process is different from commonly known 3D printing, which creates a physical object from a digital design by laying down thin layers of liquid or powdered plastic, metal or cement.', 'The two companies aspire to deepen the collaboration into later phases should the pilot prove successful. unspun, in collaboration with a manufacturing partner, hopes to ultimately deploy additional microsites around the U.S. for on- and near-shored manufacturing, with locations to be determined. unspun has an ambition to have 350 machines in the U.S. by 2030.', '""The pressing need to address ongoing climate change, reduce carbonization and drive to more transparent and localized apparel manufacturing practices is at the heart of our mission,"" said Beth Esponnette, co-founder of unspun.

Now, together with Walmart, we see an enormous opportunity to take our innovations to scale, with the potential to disrupt the garment manufacturing industry, bring jobs to the USA and drastically reduce waste in apparel.""', '""unspun\'s technology aims to be the fastest, highest quality and most economical way to make woven garments period. Innovative industry leaders like Walmart are beginning to see the future potential impact, and we expect there to be continued interest as the unspun team builds the future of manufacturing,"" said Shuo Yang, Lowercarbon Capital.', 'Shaping the Future of Retail', 'Today’s announcement closely follows a series of innovative tech initiatives unveiled by Walmart in recent months. On Jan. 9, 2024, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Walmart showcased tech-powered enhancements, including expanded drone delivery in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex; computer vision exit technology at Sam’s Clubs; AI, GenAI and AR enhancements for customers, members and associates; along with ambitious commitments to clean energy. In July 2023, Walmart announced a pilot for innovative carbon capture and conversion technology also for the apparel manufacturing supply chain.', 'A long-time leader on sustainability, Walmart has worked with suppliers, NGOs and climate action leaders to inspire positive change across global value chains since 2005. In its own operations, Walmart has set a goal to be powered 50% by renewable energy by 2025 and 100% by 2035. More than 5,900 suppliers globally are engaged in Project Gigaton™, and as of February 21, suppliers have now reported projects that are expected to exceed the 1 billion metric ton mark, helping Walmart reach their goal six years early.', 'About unspun:', ""Founded by Beth Esponnette, Walden Lam and Kevin Martin, unspun is a fashion and technology company with a mission to revolutionize garment production and reduce waste in the fashion industry. They have pioneered Vega™️, the world's first 3D weaving technology, which efficiently transforms yarn into garments.

Let's look at some excellent reasons to buy these top dividend giants."", ""You'll generally do well by owning successful market leaders, and Home Depot certainly fits that bill. The home improvement giant dominates its industry, as illustrated by the fact that its growth and profit margins are well above those of its peers. Home Depot posted a modest 4% comparable-store sales decline last quarter compared to the 6% slump at Lowe's (NYSE: LOW). The chain's profit margin, at 14% of sales, routinely beats its smaller rival, too."", 'Home Depot is calling for another year of slightly lower sales in 2024. Do-it-yourself shoppers are spending less cash on home improvement projects and the housing market has slowed due to rising interest rates. Yet the chain has thrived through many cyclical downturns in the past and has always gone on to set new sales and earnings records.', 'Putting $500 into the stock right now would yield about $12 in annual passive income. But shareholders can count on that payout rising over the years -- even following its generous 8% hike in early 2024.', 'Walmart is starting to shed its reputation of being just a stodgy dividend stock. The retailer recently announced accelerating sales growth for the fourth-quarter holiday shopping period, anchored by rising customer traffic. Its focus on price leadership is paying off at a time when people are looking for savings on groceries and other essentials. Walmart gained market share in these critical niches in Q4, management revealed in late February. ""Our team delivered a great quarter,"" CEO Doug McMillon said.', ""The company backed up those positive comments with a bigger cash return commitment. Walmart hiked its dividend by 9% this past quarter, or about four times last year's increase."", ""It's not hard to see why the retailer is more financially flush these days. Besides the faster sales growth, profit margins are rising thanks to lower costs and strong expansion in areas like digital advertising sales."", ""These wins aren't going to make Walmart perform like a tech-focused growth stock. It's still a highly mature business, after all. However, you'll get stable sales and earnings generation from this global retailer, without much of a risk of a recession tanking its results. In the meantime, you can sit back and collect income from a dividend that has risen for over 50 consecutive years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Home Depot wasn’t one of them.

That was the headline takeaway from the retailer's March earnings update, which showed solid sales growth through mid-February."", ""The giant warehouse retailer continues to win market share thanks to its low product prices. Yet its members aren't simply buying consumer essentials anymore; they're also increasingly splurging on discretionary products like jewelry, gold, and appliances."", ""Let's take a look at the most encouraging news from this latest earnings report, and whether it means the stock is still an attractive buy right now."", ""If it has seemed to you that Costco's aisles are packed lately, you're right. Customer traffic was up 5% this past quarter, in fact. Combined with a 1% uptick in average spending, this boost translated into 6% higher comparable-store sales for the period."", 'Rival Walmart (NYSE: WMT), by contrast, posted a 4% traffic increase in the most recent quarter (and 4% higher comps). While both retailers are growing quickly, Costco stands out even among industry leaders.', 'Management credited its aggressive pricing strategy for helping keep shoppers engaged. ""We always want to be the first out there trying to lower prices,"" CFO Richard Galanti said in a conference call with investors.', ""One of the fastest growth niches these days is Costco's e-commerce division, which expanded at an 18% rate in the recent period. That's a big acceleration from the prior quarter's 6% boost and suggests shoppers are increasingly tilting spending back toward discretionary purchases rather than focusing only on essentials like groceries."", ""Costco saw huge demand for its new gold bar products, and online shoppers were also busy buying appliances into early 2024. There's a long runway for growth ahead in the e-commerce niche beyond simply introducing more popular products (like silver most recently). Costco is also busy adding partnerships with massive consumer brands even as it markets its own services, ranging from automotive to vacation packages."", ""Costco's renewal rate is one of the single best metrics that investors can follow for an indication of its business strength, because it reflects the value that shoppers are getting from their annual subscriptions. There's nothing for shareholders to worry about in this area; Costco's renewal rate ticked up to a new record of 92.9% in the core U.S. market."", ""Part of that success can be attributed to the fact that the chain hasn't raised its annual prices in over six years. It is overdue in that hike, which tends to happen about every five years or so. Investors shouldn't expect the next fee increase to instantly boost Costco's earnings power, since the company tends to direct almost all of its excess cash into keeping prices low. But over time, this strategy yields higher customer traffic, rising membership levels, and increased market share."", ""The biggest risk for investors, then, is in paying too high of a price for this well-performing business. That's an appropriate concern given that Costco stock is valued at 1.3 times sales today, or about twice the premium attached to Walmart or Target shares."", ""Yet the chain is earning that premium by generating faster sales growth.

If you want to skip our overview of the current stock market climate, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Stocks Under $100 To Buy Now. ', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

Two women executives are launching Be a Breadwinner to help women achieve their financial goals, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati talks about the company's new video generation platform, and Fortune senior writer Maria Aspan reports on the sudden departure of Under Armour CEO Stephanie Linnartz. Have a terrific Thursday. "", '- Abrupt endings. CEO Stephanie Linnartz thought she had three years to turn around Under Armour. Instead, she’s leaving after just one year.', 'Under Armour, the long-struggling sportswear company still controlled by founder Kevin Plank, on Wednesday said that Plank would replace Linnartz as CEO, effective April 1. Plank will become Under Armour’s fourth CEO in four years after he initially “stepped down” from the role in 2020. (He has remained executive chairman since then, and still owns 65% of Under Armour’s voting shares.)', 'It’s a shocking departure for Linnartz, a well-respected executive who was previously No. 2 at Marriott International—and yet it’s also not surprising. Linnartz knew that she was taking a big gamble on a turnaround job at Under Armour, as she told me last summer for a Fortune profile.', '“I believe in taking calculated risks,” she told me then. “I don’t believe in being reckless.”', 'But it was obvious, even early into Linnartz’s tenure, that Plank didn’t want to give up control of the company he founded in 1996. (I knew it was a bad sign when he declined multiple requests to get on the phone with me for that article, for a quick interview about his new CEO.) And Linnartz had a lot to fix, most of which Plank was ultimately responsible for: slowing growth, a plummeting share price, a faded “second-tier” brand, and a founder who couldn’t stop generating controversy. As I wrote in October:', 'Recent years have given us several examples of ambitious, experienced executives—often women—who take on a CEO job that involves working for a predecessor or founder, and trying to keep him happy while fixing some of the problems he created.\xa0', '...Everyone has a boss to keep happy—even ridiculously well-compensated CEOs—and the vagaries of working for the guy you’re supposedly replacing aren’t always gendered. But it’s striking how many ambitious women, still, have to take such risks in order to get a shot at the top spot in corporate America, where women account for barely 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs. The career choices made by [former Walgreens CEO Roz] Brewer, [current X CEO Linda] Yaccarino, and potentially Linnartz also raise questions about how much executives still have to navigate the “glass cliff,” the data-backed phenomenon in which women have to accept riskier opportunities in order to advance.', 'Women CEOs already have shorter tenures than men, as my colleague Lila MacLellan recently reported, and replacing a male founder seems particularly fraught. Last month, Nextdoor said that cofounder Nirav Tolia will replace CEO Sarah Friar.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""On the face of it, Xylem's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 13% either. Therefore, Xylem's flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors."", 'Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 7.5% over the last few years.', ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).

If you're wondering about Xylem's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry."", ""The high three-year median payout ratio of 53% (meaning, the company retains only 47% of profits) for Xylem suggests that the company's earnings growth was miniscule as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings."", ""In addition, Xylem has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 10%, over the same period."", ""Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Xylem. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return.

It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.', ""According to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\xa0"", 'Meanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.', 'In this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

Joining me on the call today is Robert Piconi, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Kees van Gaalen, our Chief Financial Officer.', ""At this time, I'd like to hand the call over to Robert Piconi."", ""Robert Piconi: Great. Thank you, Bernie and I'd like to welcome to everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. We're announcing results on our second year now as a public company, which happens to be also our second year of revenue. As you tend to do sometimes, it can be helpful to step back, zoom out, if you will, and look at how we progress these past two years as I did after our first year. We've grown this company as a public company globally in unprecedented ways across multiple continents, multiple technologies, while serving different customer segments, public utilities, independent power players, and large industrial energy users. The result has been the fastest-growing company in energy storage in only our first two years."", ""We continue to monetize our long-duration gravity technology via regional license and royalty agreement that will pay long-term dividends and royalties and capped a tremendous second half of 2023, executing multiple battery energy storage projects across the U.S. market with the newly developed Energy Management Software platform that is winning rave reviews from customers and has been a key differentiator in our rapid commissioning timeframes and ability to quickly get through commissioning and site energization regardless of the underlying hardware. I think finally, and as a testament to our strategy of solving customer problems as an energy storage solutions provider, we began construction on a first-of-its-kind green hydrogen hybrid energy storage system to provide multi-day storage to the city of Calistoga, California for Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility."", 'Energy Vault uniquely will own this system under a tolling agreement to PG&E as we also presented the only fully sustainable solution to replace their prior diesel generation systems historically used to secure continuous power, and it will be operational in the mid part of this year. Those are some of the key highlights. Very proud of our progress, our delivery in our first two years, and never been more excited about what the future holds as I am now as we continue to push boundaries and innovation, while fortifying strong customer relationships that will be the basis of our future. Clearly, we continue to operate in our sector in a very volatile capital market and despite that, the team has remained focused on the most important investor priorities, and I would say there are three of those.', ""First, executing for our customers and keeping the customer loyalty that are really the key to our future and really the foundation of our house that we're building here after getting through two years. Without those customers and without those future revenue streams and with those customers now uniquely as reference points for future deals and future customers, we would not have a bright future. I feel very good about that. Second, profitable unit economics as we grow. You can imagine as a new company when you're approaching the likes of some of the largest public utilities and some of the most prominent independent power producers, you don't necessarily have the highest leverage in the contract negotiation. Despite us having, I think, one of the most experienced team in the industry, which is what led some of these largest customers to have the confidence and faith in us to deliver for them on very critical projects, we negotiated -- they put their faith in us, and we've delivered quarter-over-quarter with profitable unit economics."", ""And finally, and I think this is definitely not least from an investor perspective, we have protected our balance sheet and liquidity as a company to allow us to control our destiny, to invest in growth, and eliminate any dilutive types of financing to shareholders. I think this, and as you've seen, if our results, if you happen to read through them, which I'll highlight them here in just a minute, this has been an important aspect in particular, in Q4, where we took some proactive actions as it is clear the market has spoken on the desire for even new young companies in a very high growth and necessary market for the future of the planet must get to cash flow positive. With that, I want to begin by covering some of the highlights from our release with some more color, and then we'll turn it over to Jan Kees, our CFO, to review detailed financials and get to questions."", ""Off the top, our revenue finished in the range that we've been reaffirming all year, $341.5 million, which is up over 130% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter, within our annual range due to some shifts of revenue at the end of Q4 that will take place in Q1 and in 2024, its towards the lower end of that range. We ended the year, however, with an increased cash position of $146 million and with no debt, which is above our prior guidance of $132 million from Q3 2023 earnings and projections. This is pretty noteworthy as we have kept and funded projects in California, for example, the Calistoga project for PG&E and Texas on our balance sheet, so we can participate in these projects in the longer term, predictable and less lumpy cash flows, and revenue streams from these tolling agreements, yet we were still able to grow cash quarter-over-quarter as we began to turn some of our first projects in the second half of the year to substantial completion and final completion."", ""Very importantly, we also reduced our quarterly cash operating expense run rate by 25% to 30% through actions taken in Q4 2023. This should enable a 2024 reduced quarterly cash OpEx of a range of $13 million to $15 million. We expect these actions to help us accelerate our shift to cash flow positive as we exit 2024 and for full year 2025 results, which we'll be sharing more about during our announced Investor Day, which I'll be talking about shortly. For the year on gross margin, we delivered a positive gross margin of 5.1%, while reflecting a portion of that, a lower-than-expected Q4 gross margin, due only to timing of revenue and associated gross profit recognition that shifted from Q4 into Q1 and 2024 for gravity license and also some battery projects."", 'As I will discuss, gross margins will improve significantly in the first quarter of 2024, benefiting from this shift from Q4, but also due to the mix of revenue with gravity and battery project timing. While this did impact Q4 for both revenue and final EBITDA and EPS, this represents only a timing shift, which will be recognized under U.S. GAAP accounting in 2024. And finally, our commercial pipeline continues to expand with annual year-over-year growth of 24.5 gigawatt hours to a total of 52 gigawatt hours or almost 90% growth. It also expanded sequentially quarter-over-quarter by 5.8 gigawatt hours, up 13%. This shows continued market growth, continued market activity, also with significantly larger projects, two of which we are announcing as new project awards in the U.S. for gravity and a large 2.5 gigawatt hour long-duration battery project, representing an additional continental expansion with a large global IPP.', 'While these larger projects boards have large impacts on forecasting revenue recognition and can create more lumpy quarters and annual guidance, they are both quite transformational in size, scope, and technology adoption in both first-of-a-kind because of those attributes. As always, we are focused on converting this growing commercial funnel into contracts that further bolster our revenue and backlog, and we remain committed to continue our track record of building profitable growth and unit economics with all new projects we choose to take on. We want to work on the velocity through our funnel. We post every quarter, our four stages of our more near-term sales funnel that starts from submitted proposals, goes to shortlisted, goes to awarded projects, and then to final bookings.', 'I encourage you to keep an eye on that and take a look at our latest Investor website with that update with the numbers that I just reviewed. As you all know from our announced and executed projects so far, we focus on larger and meaningful projects with strong customers that have a funnel of projects where we are developing deep partnerships over time. I realize for many of you in our investor base, Energy Vault is quite a unique animal, relative to any other pure-play energy storage company, given our unique portfolio of short, long, and even ultra-long duration storage solutions. But I believe this has also enabled us to be one of the most customer-centric energy storage customers, listening to our customers and solving their problems with a broad portfolio of technology, innovation, and solutions that is unmatched in the market.', ""Looking forward, as we are just a few weeks away from our Q1 2024 finish, we expect revenue to be in line with our prior Q1 2023, given normal seasonality of revenue recognition and project starts with potential for upside from items that were expected in Q4 2023. We also expect stronger double-digit gross margins in Q1, again, given the shift of revenue and gross margin recognition from the prior Q4 2023. I think very importantly, as we go to investor priorities, we expect to exit Q1 2024 with an unrestricted cash balance in a range of $125 million to $150 million. Additionally, we've reduced any remaining restricted cash on the balance sheet to less than $1 million and remain 100% debt-free. Our performance here on cash is attributed to our focus and tight management of our business as our growth and our cash balance at the end of the year shows, and we project to keep cash levels maintained at these levels without the need for debt or any dilutive equity transactions going forward."", ""As we continue to look at owned projects on our balance sheet, providing predictable longer term revenue streams, we may evaluate project financing alternatives if they're attractive. This aspect of cash management, managing our operating expense, our culture tied to innovation, and focus on customers is all ingrained in the employees of this company and as demonstrated by the proactive actions we took in Q4 to reduce our quarterly cash OpEx rate by about 30% as we entered into 2024. We took these actions to continue to provide strong balance sheet flexibility for growth, while accelerating our move to operating cash flow positive, which we have guided for our finish in Q4 this year and for the full year of 2025. We understand the nature of the lumpiness in our current business model and are also taking actions to adapt our product mix and business to reduce this volatility over time."", ""We will be sharing much more detail in this regard in May formally at our first Investor Analyst Day on May 8th. While we are discussing forecast, I want to mention two projects that were awarded in Q4 that are both multi gigawatt hour and transformational and technology and territory expansion. We were awarded in Q4 a 2.5 gigawatt hour DC long-duration battery energy storage project by a leading international IPP that also represents a territorial expansion, and we'll be sharing more details on this project at our Investor Day. We also announced a new development agreement with a large primary public utility in the State of Washington, using our gravity energy storage technology to address another multi-gigawatt our storage need regionally in the Northwest."", 'This is so exciting for us as it represents the first public utility in the U.S. with an agreement of this size and scope for gravity, which complements the previously announced gravity collaboration project with ENEL Green Power in Snyder, Texas, which is now up and out of the ground. Most of you are aware that demand for long-duration storage remains more nascent at this stage, although Energy Vault continues to solidify its global leadership role here with various gravity and green hydrogen ultra-long duration solutions and multi-day storage solutions that are now starting deployment in large scale across three of the largest energy storage markets in the world, in the U.S., China, and Africa. Specific to our gravity business, important to highlight our territory expansion to Southern Africa, as I just mentioned, across the 16 member SADC-member countries via a new license and royalty agreement that was executed in Q4.', ""In China in Rudong, we achieved state grid interconnection as planned in December of Q4 2023 for the first 25 megawatt EVx gravity storage system and achieved inverse power operation. Also in China, there are now three additional gravity energy storage systems of 360 megawatt hour, bringing the total projects underway and announced to over 3.7 gigawatt hours. China continues to be an amazing bed of growth and growth and focus as state-mandated for not only renewable generation projects, but also for the state-mandated energy storage. We continue to be very excited about the work with China Tianying and their active development and expansion in the market locally. As also noted above, we have our first USA-based gravity project with a public utility with the announcement of the new development agreement in Washington and an application of our technology that's being uniquely applied to take advantage of existing topology to maximize efficiency at a reduced CapEx and thus providing strong economics without the need for any subsidies."", ""We'll be very excited to share more on this project, given its scale, size, and application of a new technology. Moving from gravity to our battery businesses. We delivered and progressed final commissioning on our first three battery energy storage systems totaling almost 1 gigawatt hour. Specifically with Wellhead Electric, as previously announced and Nevada Energy, 440 megawatt hour were commissioned on schedule and in record timeframes from site mobilization to system energization. Also, the project with Jupiter Power is expected to be fully commissioned in the coming weeks here prior to the first quarter close. Regarding our green hydrogen, microgrid, and ultra long storage duration, we commenced construction on the largest green hydrogen project and microgrid system in the U.S. with California's largest public utility, Pacific Gas & Electric."", ""The project is supported by a 10.5-year tolling agreement with commercial operation expected in mid-2024. This solidifies Energy Vault's global leadership role in green hydrogen technology for long-duration energy storage and specific microgrids for multi-day storage. It's important to note here that while owning this project on our balance sheet will impact near-term revenue recognition in favor of long-term and predictable revenue streams from the tolling agreement, we believe this will also result in more predictable and less lumpy revenue streams with increased margins over time, which we believe is best for Energy Vault and our investors as we scale our business. Very excited to share progress now as we ramped up new systems with our new software platform and energy management system, our proprietary VaultOS Energy Management Software, showing its innovation right out of the gate, enabling efficient commissioning of our first projects that were turned over in the second half of 2023 and will begin contributing SaaS-based recurring revenues in 2024."", 'Albeit small at the start and will always be a smaller percentage of the overall portfolio, but critical high-margin part of the portfolio and our product mix, the software portfolio continues to introduce new capabilities, which now includes two additional products that we will be reviewing in more detail at the upcoming Investor Day. One being Vault-Manager for maximizing project, return on investments via optimizing asset performance, using enhanced performance analytics and predictive models to provide greater system reliability and visibility. And secondly, Vault-Bidder to provide competitive dispatch, continuous revenue optimization via market participation, serving the ISO and IPP markets as well as for our own projects that we manage and operate.', ""Finally, I'd be remiss if I was not recognizing a great year around our project execution. This was an important proven year for us to execute on over 1.7 gigawatt hour of projects announced in our first year of revenue and as a public company in 2022 in which we demonstrated that we can deliver on our promises and complete world-class energy storage facilities on time, on budget, and at performance levels at or above expectations of our very challenging customers. Although there are many to mention, one example. We built, commissioned, and energized the 440 megawatt hour system in Nevada Energy's Reid Gardner site about an hour outside of Las Vegas within four months of site mobilization, energizing the system on December 29th in order to meet the customers' requirement to be online prior to year-end."", 'I spent some time at the site with our team on site that was working with the local contractors with some of our partners and the tremendous work they did to do something that as far as we know, has never been done before at this size, at this scale, and within this timeframe. These are the things that go unseen and unheard about these unprecedented turnaround times in project delivery and energization are the nights, weekends, holiday times dedicated by our Energy Vault team to move heaven and earth to deliver for the customer. I want to recognize all of our employees that make this happen every day for our customers as our first projects demonstrated, none of which were without supply chain and supplier delivery issues that needed to be managed, solved, anticipated, and resolved.', ""Just to our employees, I'm happy to be on this call today to stand upon your shoulders on this quarterly report to talk about these results. I do not take it lightly, as you know, it is a pleasure to be here and support you in what you're doing every day. These customer satisfaction areas and testimonials are proving to be some of our best sales tools as we are well-positioned now for the next level of success, both within these customers that we've executed for, as well as new customers that observe our performance. We look forward to providing more detail on our Investor Day and Analyst Day that is scheduled for May 8th, 2024, in New York City. We've received a lot of feedback from the investor base about getting in front of you in more detail about our strategy, about the evolution of our portfolio, and also about a view into where we're going as a company in achieving the vision that we set out at the beginning."", ""The event's going to include new product and customer announcements, portfolio updates, and financial guidance. It will include customers and partners that will be speaking -- customers and partners that have experience with us in delivery, but also new technology and new partners that we're working with and expanding our growth across the globe. I look forward to seeing any of you that can attend at that session. I'd like to now turn it over to Jan Kees, who will share some financial details for the quarter. Jan Kees?"", ""Jan Kees van Gaalen: Yes. Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon everybody. Let's talk about revenue. Financial results are highlighted by our full year 2023 revenue of more than $340 million, 134% higher than in 2022. This revenue reflects the successful execution across our project portfolio in the United States under a build, commission, and transfer model. Next, going into gross margin. Our gross margin was 5.1% for the full year of 2023, temporarily impacted by the unfavorable timing of a few items. First, we delivered a significant amount of hardware in the second half of the year that didn't have any margin associated with it due to the POC accounting rules under GAAP. The value-add margin on that hardware will be recognized in the first half of 2024."", 'And second, a high-margin licensing transaction shifted out from the fourth quarter of 2023 to 2024. Adjusted EBITDA. During 2023, our net loss amounted to $98.4 million, reflecting the points I previously mentioned and for the quarter, net loss amounted to $22.2 million. For the year ending December 31st, 2023, our adjusted EBITDA was negative $62.1 million and for the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA declined $3.6 million year-over-year to negative $14.8 million, reflecting a shift in timing of both battery and gravity revenue and gross profit from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. The key non-cash items added back in the fourth quarter were $8.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in net interest income. We do remain laser-focused on optimizing our cost structure to realize profitability as soon as possible as the business continues to scale up and we remain very encouraged with our progress towards positive adjusted EBITDA.', 'Cash. As of December 31st, 2023, we had $145.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, leaving us well-positioned to continue our growth strategy and execute on our projects. Our primary uses of cash are cash operating expenses and working capital needs associated with equipment purchases for our energy storage projects. As the projects achieve milestones and ultimately begin to generate revenue and gross margin, some of that cash will return to our balance sheet. In addition to this strong cash position, as of today, we have reduced the restricted portion of our cash significantly from $35.6 million to -- that we had at the end of December 2023. Restricted cash is now down to less than $1 million as of today. Please keep in mind that we maintain a bonding capacity in excess of $1 billion to facilitate additional growth projects as we desire.', ""Thank you. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Rob."", 'Robert Piconi: Great. Thank you, Jan Kees. Look, in closing here, before getting to questions, I want to first thank again all of our employees that, in only our second year as a public company delivered with quality, with velocity, and profitability across all of our projects. Model behaviors define our culture and customer focus, innovation, delivery, all underscored by our core values and humility, collaboration, problem-solving, and leading as an organization to deliver a more sustainable world for our future. A few critical milestones upcoming this year. Full operation of multiple gravity energy storage systems in China, which will generate future royalty streams and help China curtail its current increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which are larger than the next six to seven countries combined.', ""Delivering commissioning of the first and largest green hydrogen energy storage system in California, to serve as a critical replacement of diesel generation for the residents of Calistoga, California sustainably. And then territory expansions for our entire storage portfolio from Southern Africa to new starts in Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. A few things to keep an eye on there, priorities this year. We'll begin updates on all those areas at our upcoming Investor Day. And then financially, very clear as you've heard as a theme on this call, setting ourselves up in 2024 as a profitable growth platform, while achieving cash flow positive as we exit and for full year 2025. As you have seen in our results and forecast, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt, strong OpEx management in place, and thus the flexibility to continue to invest in growth."", ""This is enabling us to invest and own projects with longer term and more predictable and higher-margin cash flows as the case in Calistoga, for example, with PG&E with a long-term tolling agreement. While this business model will result in less recognized revenue in the near-term on projects that we would otherwise build commission and transfer under an EPC model. As previously discussed, we believe this can be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders and thus Energy Vault, while helping to buffer the quarterly impact of larger projects that are being awarded on a global basis. We look forward to seeing many of you that could join us in New York at our Investor and Analyst Day on May 8th. We will be speaking again on May 7th at our Q1's earnings announcement."", ""We have a lot of new and exciting developments to share that will help provide context on the next 12 months to 24 months given the magnitude of the project awards we've announced here today as well as our ongoing growth of the business. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions."", 'See also 36 Countries with Deflation or Dangerously Low Inflation and Female Smoking Rates by Country: Top 20.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Let's examine the case for and against Palantir's moat and assess whether now is a good time to scoop up shares as the AI narrative takes shape."", ""Here, I've provided some reasons that could support the notion of Palantir's moat."", 'Many start-ups rush to raise funding from venture capitalists and try to bring products to market as quickly as possible. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these companies often experience some pushback from early customers, as initial iterations of the product often come with glitches or do not meet the specific needs of the client.', ""Palantir was founded 21 years ago by Peter Thiel, Joe Lonsdale, and Alex Karp. One of the company's unique aspects is that it spent decades developing its software first, making commercialization a secondary responsibility."", 'The company reached $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2019 -- nearly two decades after it was founded. And yet just three years later, Palantir generated over $2 billion in revenue last year. I think that by placing a premium on product capabilities first, Palantir is now just entering its main growth phase -- despite being a more than 20-year-old enterprise.', 'As silly as it might sound, brand appeal can play a huge role in establishing economic moats. The fashion industry is a great example of this, with consumers often willing to pay premium prices for goods sold by certain brands.', ""In the tech environment, Tesla is one of the strongest brands out there. Unlike traditional automotive companies, Tesla is rarely seen bombarding consumers with commercials produced at a Hollywood level. It doesn't need to."", ""For better or worse, Tesla is synonymous with its outspoken CEO, Elon Musk. Musk's 176 million followers on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), which he also owns, gives him unprecedented reach to market the latest and greatest in Tesla's services. In other words, Musk is Tesla's marketing."", ""A similar dynamic applies to Palantir. The company's CEO, Alex Karp, often makes brazen comments during earnings calls and media interviews. While he never speaks ill of specific competitors, his confidence in Palantir's software is clear. This attitude has earned Karp the respect of prominent Wall Streeters such as Cathie Wood and Dan Ives and a loyal following from retail investors."", ""When it comes to debunking Palantir's moat, I really only see one big reason: competition."", 'Despite spending many years developing its intellectual property (IP) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, Palantir faces competition from a number of larger players. In particular, Microsoft competes with Palantir through its Fabric offering.', 'While Microsoft is much more diverse than Palantir, operating in areas including personal computing and gaming, the company boasts $81 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. This provides Microsoft with sweeping financial horsepower, allowing the company to encroach on Palantir more seriously if it wants to.', 'Another competitor to Palantir is a privately held start-up called Databricks. According to the company, Databricks is operating at a $1.5 billion revenue run rate and growing 50% year over year.', 'Not only does this put the company within respectable distance of Palantir in terms of size, but the smaller company is growing much faster.', ""In essence, I don't think that Palantir has a true economic moat. However, I would say that the company has a significant competitive advantage in its deep IP."", 'The rate at which Palantir is accelerating its customer acquisition should not go unnoticed. In the fourth quarter alone, Palantir increased revenue from commercial customers in the U.S. by 70%. Moreover, Palantir also closed 103 deals during the last three months of 2023 -- 21 of which were worth at least $10 million.', ""This tells me that Palantir's services are in demand and the company is in the early innings of establishing itself as a leader in the AI landscape. So even though Palantir may not have a true moat, I still see the company as one of the best AI software opportunities in the market. Now could be a great time to scoop up some shares as Palantir continues to lead the AI story in enterprise software."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

The most prudent strategy is to spread money across a group of AI stocks. With that in mind, Microsoft and Docebo warrant further consideration.', 'Microsoft has two major growth engines in enterprise software and cloud computing, and the company controls a large chunk of both markets.

The company launched a natural language assistant for Microsoft 365 that can draft text in Word and create content in PowerPoint. It also launched a generative AI assistant for Dynamics 365 that can automate sales, customer service, and finance workflows.', 'Similarly, Microsoft has formed an exclusive partnership with OpenAI.

Today, it refers to seven stocks that have powered indexes higher over the past year or so. Each of these players is a technology giant, a leader in its specialty area, and offers fantastic growth prospects. These innovators are: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.', ""You could benefit from the Magnificent Seven by investing directly in their shares, but you might wonder which one to choose. And you may not want to go all in on this investing theme and buy shares of all of the Magnificent Seven companies. But there is another way to gain exposure to this exciting basket of stocks, and at the same time, you could turn $100 per month into $325,000 over time. Sounds like a good deal? Let's find out how to do it."", 'The Magnificent Seven stocks have driven gains in the S&P 500, pushing the index into a bull market because they are heavily weighted in the index. All but one make up the top 10 stocks in the benchmark -- electric vehicle giant Tesla recently dropped into the top 20.', ""So, if you bet on the S&P 500's performance, you're actually placing a bet on these industry leaders since they make up such a significant part of the index. And the best way to do this is through buying an index fund such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY)."", ""These funds reflect the structure of the S&P 500, holding the same stocks at the same percentages. So, if the S&P 500 index climbs 5%, for example, the index fund will follow. This offers you a great opportunity to get in on the most dynamic companies in today's economy without having to individually pick stocks and worry about the ups and downs of one particular player."", ""And speaking of ups and downs, an index fund's diversification across stocks and industries means that when one suffers, the others may compensate -- and this limits your losses."", ""Finally, a look at history shows us the S&P 500 always wins over the long haul. After every bear market, the index has gone on to recover and gain, so this suggests that if you hold on to an index fund for the long term, you're likely to grow your investment."", ""Now let's talk about how to maximize your gains. You could go out and invest in an index fund in one go and then sit back, forget about it, and let the investment grow -- and that's fine. But you may supercharge your investment by investing monthly over the long haul and benefit from the magic of compounding, or the idea that gains produce further gains."", ""Let's look at an example, considering the S&P 500 will over time deliver an average annual increase of about 10% as it's done in the past. If you invest $100 monthly in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, your investment could reach more than $325,000 over 35 years. You will have contributed $42,000, and you'll collect more than $280,000 in returns."", 'You could invest more or less according to your budget and adjust the holding time to suit your investment horizon -- but a period of at least 20 years will greatly amplify your results.', ""And this strategy offers you one more positive point. It consistently will offer you exposure to the companies powering the economy. Today, these top players are the Magnificent Seven, but if that changes at some point down the road, the index's composition will reflect that -- and the index fund will follow."", ""So right now and over time, by investing in an S&P 500 index fund regularly, you may benefit from the stock market's leading players and steadily progress along the path to financial freedom."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

Before we start the business update, I want to provide some perspective on the additional release that we issued this morning on the progress we have made in our internal investigation, which is being led by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Throughout this process, we have continued to operate the business and drive our strategic priorities forward.

Our full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.98, the second best EPS in our history, and our adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, making another year of ROIC performance above our 10% target. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $4.7 billion. Our strong cash flow and disciplined management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.', ""In total, we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2023. In January, with the expectation of continued strong cash flows in 2024, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend, raising our dividend to $0.50 per share, which marks 92 years of uninterrupted dividends and over 51 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. Today, we also announced that our Board has authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2 billion in shares in 2024 under ADM's existing share repurchase program. Our performance for 2023 shows the overall effectiveness of our strategy, where our broad portfolio of business is combined to deliver resilient results for the year. Despite a more challenging operating environment, we maintained strong earnings and ROIC while delivering key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise."", 'Next slide please. To put our 2023 results into perspective, at the end of 2021, we provided a roadmap to create value and growth returns by getting closer to customers and highlighted where we expected to perform on several important strategic metrics by 2025.

We know that 2024 will be a more challenging year that we faced in 2022 and 2023. We see tailwinds that supported a portion of our performance over the past few years changing direction, making our continued progress on our strategic metrics more reliant than ever on our productivity and innovation agenda. In 2024, we will continue to focus on those strategic initiatives that provide strong growth prospects."", 'Our destination marketing efforts continue to bring us closer to our customers and enable us to serve them in a differentiated capacity and we continue to expand.

Through this ongoing expansion, we expect to achieve 6% growth in our destination market in volumes. Direct farmer buying has been steadily increasing over the past several years and provides ADM an opportunity to maximize value for both sides by creating efficiencies through working directly together.

I mentioned earlier the opening of our Green Bison soy processing facility as well as the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility. These capacity additions support growing demand for a wide variety of sustainable products and solutions, from renewable fuels to industrial products. And connected to our productivity efforts, we have formally launched a 2024 program we call the Drive for Execution Excellence within the organization.', ""Over the years, we have consistently encouraged our ADM colleagues to identify and execute both cost saving and cash generation ideas.

As part of this, we have already commissioned more than 300 projects and plan to see $500 million in traceable cost savings over the next two years across all aspects of our enterprise, from operations to supply chain to corporate costs. Now let's discuss our plans within the Nutrition business. We're calling this section, of course, nutrition recovery for a reason. Nutrition had a very difficult year with results well below our expectations, and we have been working aggressively to change this and return to growth."", ""For Nutrition, 2023 representing a combination of challenging market forces, some specific non-recurring events and some misses on demand fulfillment. And while market forces such as customer destocking as well as softer demand for plant-based proteins are not within our control, we're already taking action on the areas we can improve. Many of the supply issues are the result of the complexity built into the Nutrition business over time. In our zeal to meet our customers' needs, we have created one of the strongest pantries in the industry. This added complexity in our operations and supply chain that at times impacted our ability to efficiently fulfill demand. To address this, we have made important changes to drive simplification across the Nutrition business that will ease the pressure on our overall supply chain and dramatically improve our demand fulfillment performance."", 'First, we have created a stronger division of duty across operations leadership and added new leaders with a strong expertise in supply chain management. We have also taken steps to build our COE expertise back into the core business, helping make our overall supply chain capabilities more agile and responsive to commercial demand signals. We have also engaged third party experts to help identify further opportunities for operational excellence improvements across our largest facilities. We have also greatly simplified the product and production line landscape to further achieve operational and supply efficiency, reducing the brands we are presenting to customers by two thirds and downsizing about 17% of our SKUs alongside the strategic production line simplification.', ""A recent example of this is the closure of more than 20 Animal Nutrition production lines in 2023, now better serving the product mix and supply chain efficiency of the business. We're also optimizing our Nutrition business portfolio, leveraging our experience in both large scale and bolt-on acquisitions. We have enhanced our approach to M&A integration to increase value creation as we focus more on the integration of recent acquisitions than new targets. We continue to assess our portfolio for a strategic fit, making surgical decisions to achieve the returns targets we expect. For example, during Q4, we took action on two JVs that were not expected to meet our returns criteria. We're proud to see how the team with new leadership has rallied around this recovery plan, which is already showing signs of improvement as we move through the first quarter of the year."", ""Recent trends suggest that destocking impacts in beverages are subsiding and we are well positioned to capture recovering demand in 2024 as evidenced by the strong demand we are seeing in flavors. After heightening our operational efficiency, we've seen steady increases in shipping volumes and productions throughout the course of the last month. And in Animal Nutrition, we have seen another quarter of sequential improvement in the base of the business, which excludes amino acids and pet solutions and early indications in the first quarter of 2024 suggest that this will continue. Importantly, our nutrition value proposition continues to be well received by customers as evidenced by our robust opportunity pipeline and industry leading win rates across key categories like flavors, dietary supplements and pep."", ""ADM's customer centricity and agile innovation capabilities, supported through our creation, design and development expertise, differentiates us. We continue to believe that Nutrition has an important role in ADM's integrated business model. Beyond adding value to the ingredients produced by our AS&O and carbohydrate solution businesses, Nutrition is innovating to address evolving consumer needs and is connecting us more closely with a growing customer base. Finally, I'll turn attention to the capital allocation strategy that continues to guide our strategic cash deployment decisions. As noted, we announced today that the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion in shares through the remainder of the year, including $1 billion in shares to be executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical."", 'This will total $6.4 billion in repurchases executed since 2022 and coupled with the already announced 11% dividend growth, this is aligned with our commitment to a balanced capital allocation approach. So, combined, we believe these three areas of focus set ADM to perform well in a challenging external operating environment in 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the results of the operations. Ishmael?', ""Ismael Roig: Thank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide 7 which provides overall segment operating income and EPS for 2023. Overall, we delivered the second highest earnings in company history, overcoming a challenging operating environment. Adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion for the full year, a 6% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in Ag Services & Oilseeds and Nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a significant increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.98 for the year. Improved pricing in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, as well as positive impacts from mark to market timing in AS&O more than offset the impact of lower crush margins, leading to a $0.70 per share improvement versus the prior year."", 'Volume improvement in AS&O was more than offset by volume declines in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, resulting in a $0.29 per share reduction in EPS versus the prior year. Higher manufacturing costs partially related to unplanned downtime at the Decatur complex led to a $0.41 per share decrease versus the prior year. And lower equity earnings primarily related to Wilmar attributed a $0.46 per share decrease versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to higher interest rates and the 1ADM implementation partially offset by higher ADMIS results drove a $0.30 per share versus the prior year. For other, benefits from share repurchases were more than offset by negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate and cycling one-time benefits from the Legal Recovery and Biofuel Producer Recovery program, leading to a $0.18 per share decrease versus the prior year.', ""Moving to Slide 8, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the full year, AS&O delivered $4.1 billion in segment operating profit, 8% lower than the record level in 2022. Ag Services segment operating profit was 15% lower versus the prior year as reduced origination volume and margins in North America were partially offset by record South American origination volumes. In global trade, destabilization of trade flows led to lower results compared to an exceptional 2022. Crushing segment operating profit for the full year was $346 million lower versus the prior year as improved process volumes were more than offset by lower crush margins and higher manufacturing costs. Refined Products and Other results were $469 million higher, resulting in a record year."", ""Results were driven by higher volumes and margins in biodiesel. Market volatility drove positive timing impacts of approximately $235 million, compared to negative timing impacts of $90 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Wilmar were $303 million in 2023, approximately 45% lower than the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 9 and look at Carbohydrate Solutions. For the full year Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $1.4 billion 3% lower versus the record prior year. In the Starches and Sweeteners segment higher pricing and mix were offset by weaker volumes and lower corn co-product values. The teams executed well in a dynamic environment, posting a record year in Wheat Milling. In Vantage Corn Processing strong exports and steady domestic demand and blending rates supported ethanol production and robust margins."", 'The prior year also included onetime benefits of $50 million related to the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery program. We also continue to make significant progress on our BioSolutions strategic initiative, delivering revenue growth well ahead of our 15% plus target. Please now turn to Slide 10. In Nutrition, revenues of $7.2 billion for the full year were 6% lower versus the prior year. Demand headwinds and destocking impacts, coupled with operational challenges related to the ERP systems integration pressured volumes. This more than offset price and mixed benefits as well as positive currency impacts. In Human Nutrition volumes declined due to lower market demand for plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages, and operational challenges related to the ERP system implantation.', 'This was partially offset by improved price and mix in flavors and texture and pricing in specialty ingredients. In Animal Nutrition, lower complete feed and premix volumes, the normalization of amino acid markets and demand fulfillment challenges in Pet Solutions led to lower revenue versus 2022. Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year Nutrition segment operating profit was $427 million, 36% lower versus the prior year. Human Nutrition results of $417 million were 25% lower than the prior year as weaker volumes as well as increased costs related to operational challenges from the ERP implementation and unplanned Decatur downtime at Decatur East were partially offset by higher pricing. Animal nutrition results of $10 million were 91% lower compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower volumes and the normalization of amino acid pricing.', 'When bridging from 2022, our performance can be characterized in three buckets, market forces, one-time items, and operational challenges. Market forces accounted for a majority of the deterioration in 2023 and as previously mentioned, this was mostly related to lower demand and plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages and lower premix and completely demand which impacted volumes across the industry.', 'SAVAN: Lastly, we also had our own operation struggles that impacted our ability to deliver on the strong demand that we have created. The implementation of ERP systems over the course of the year led to complications in shipping and producing products, negatively impacting both volumes and manufacturing costs. Over the past month, we have seen a steady improvement in operations and are confident that we will see volumes lost in 2023 come back in 2024. Now please turn to Slide 12. For the full year Other segment operating profit was $375 million, up 125% compared to the prior year. ADM Investor Services results improved on higher net interest income. Higher Captive Insurance results on new program premiums were partially offset by higher claim losses.', 'In corporate for the full year, net interest expense increased year-over-year on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate cost increased versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to one-time investment valuation losses of approximately $57 million. Please turn to Slide 13. Over the last two years the company has generated significant cash flow that have bolstered our balance sheet and provided us with financial flexibility to drive long-term growth. In 2023 we again had strong cash flow of $4.7 billion which were actualized in line with our balanced capital allocation framework. 30% or approximately $1.5 billion of cash flows were reinvested in the business to support growth and modernize our assets, including investments in new capacity and the digitization of our existing asset footprint.', 'Our cash flows also supported significant capital return in 2023 with nearly 30% earnings going to dividends and nearly 60% of cash flows or about $2.7 billion going to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2024 we expect to hold capital expenditures to a level aligned with depreciation and amortization with focus spend around the safety and reliability of assets. We also intend to manage working capital needs prudently limiting M&A beyond previously announced transactions and focusing our team on cost savings and cash generation initiatives through the drive for Execution Excellence. As Juan mentioned earlier, our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will remain focused around the shareholder. We finished the year with strong momentum in terms of returning cash, repurchasing nearly 1.6 billion of shares in Q4 and nearly 330 million of shares so far in Q1.', ""Over the course of the year, we intend to actualize 2 billion of additional share repurchases, with 1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. Now, let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on Slide 14 please. In 2024, global grain and oil seed supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather should support larger production levels in key South American countries. Assuming commodity prices ease for recent highs and trade flows adjust to the dislocations created over the past two years, we anticipate global soybean crush margins will moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. From the demand side, we continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel and low single digit soybean mill demand growth to support structural margin improvement."", ""We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 per share to $6.25 per share, representing an 18% decline from prior year at the midpoint. Now breaking down our expectations by segment for 2024, let's turn to Slide 15. In AS&O, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower and the full year to also be lower versus comparable prior periods as increased global commodity supply and normalization of margins will weigh on the segment. We anticipate global soy crush margins within the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton as the market balances better soybean availability against increased crush and renewable diesel capacity. Our Operational Excellence efforts and the ramp up of our Green Bison facility should lead to mid-to-high single digit improvement in our process volumes."", 'We expect significantly lower biodiesel margins in 2023, timing gains to reverse as contracts are executed. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower versus the prior year. For the full year, we anticipate another strong year, but slightly lower than 2023 as the improved volumes and margins in Sweeteners and Starches could be offset by weaker ethanol. For nutrition, the first quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we face headwinds from a normalizing texturants market, fixed costs associated with operational challenges related to the Decatur East and protein volumes. However, for the full year we expect Nutrition to begin its path to recovery. We anticipate conversion of our significant pipeline opportunities in Human and Animal Nutrition to yield mid-single-digit revenue growth.', 'We assume market normalization in texturants to be a headwind in 2024. We do not anticipate the significant one-time events of 2023 to recur. Back to you, Juan.', 'Juan Luciano: Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary, let me once again share the three priorities for our year ahead. We will continue our efforts across the business to drive our productivity and innovation portfolio of projects, taking advantage of capacity gains we have made and ensure that our teams are generating and executing on our drive for Execution Excellence. We continue to take aggressive actions in the nutrition business to ensure that it can deliver on the areas of growth that we have continued to build into our opportunity pipeline. This includes supporting the operational changes we have introduced, driving simplifications through our products and brands, and ensuring that our business portfolio is tuned to best achieve our return expectations.', ""And we're also actively managing our balanced capital allocation strategy, both prudently investing in the business while growing our dividends and accelerating our share repurchase program to return more to shareholders in the near-term. I believe strongly in the powerful role ADM plays as a leader in the agriculture supply chain, and that our ability to bring partners together across the value chain will be critical to driving future transformation in the food, feed, fuel and industrial markets we serve. I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. I'm confident in our ability to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Operator, please open the line for questions now."", 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.

Audit committees, which are often composed of directors with an extensive background in finance or accountancy, like CFOs, carry a lot of weight on corporate boards. And their workloads are increasing.', ""For example, in January, I wrote about the audit committee of U.S. agricultural giant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) leading an internal investigation into accounting issues related to the company's nutrition segment, which produces ingredients for both human and animal food. Pending the outcome of the investigation, the board placed the CFO, Vikram Luthar, on administrative leave, and Ismael Roig was appointed interim CFO."", 'ADM provided an update on Tuesday disclosing that a “material weakness” has been identified in its internal control over financial reporting in regard to accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales. ADM also noted that it ""continues to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice in this matter,” according to the statement.', 'The ADM episode shows how the stakes for audit committees can get very high. But aside from such urgent matters, what challenges do audit committees face more broadly?', ""Deloitte's Center for Board Effectiveness and the Center for Audit Quality's latest Audit Committee Practices Report was released on Tuesday. The findings are based on a survey of 266 audit committee members, most of whom are from U.S. public companies with more than $700 million in market cap."", 'Most audit committee members know sticking with the procedural status quo is no longer enough. “One of the surprises to me was that only about a third of the audit committee members mentioned that they felt their committee was very effective and didn’t need to really make any enhancements,” Krista Parsons, Deloitte’s Audit Committee Program leader, told me. And about two-thirds feel there are things the committee could do to enhance efficiency.', 'Increased engagement of members during meetings, and improving the quality of preview materials and presentations were all named as ways that could boost effectiveness, Parsons said.', ""The top two priorities in the next 12 months are risk-related—cybersecurity (69%) and enterprise risk management (48%)—consistent with last year's results. But at a time when audit committees' responsibilities continue to grow and evolve, a third top priority wasn’t as clearly defined. Finding talent in finance and internal audit (37%), compliance with laws and regulations (36%), and finance transformation (33%), were clustered together."", '“As I’ve been talking with audit committees over the past couple of years, there is definitely an understanding that there are more challenges when it comes to that talent gap, and that’s something they will continue to focus on,” Parsons said.', 'And 80% of respondents believe there is an opportunity for internal audit to add even more value, so they need the right talent to do so.', 'Regarding finance transformation, 66% of respondents said their audit committee has spent insufficient time in the past 12 months discussing AI governance. For finance chiefs serving on boards, this is top of mind. For example, Shannon Nash, CFO at Alphabet’s Wing, the on-demand drone delivery company, recently told me: “As a CFO and as a member of the audit committee of a public company board, I can view the role through both lenses. What I predict for 2024 is that CFOs will take a more company-wide holistic look at AI, especially generative AI.”', 'I asked Parsons what’s the most important advice for audit committees. “I always tell them that as you think about your agenda, always start with risk,” she said. “Make sure you’re not just rinsing and repeating the same agenda that you had. Think through the ‘what-ifs.’”', 'Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com', 'María Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today’s newsletter.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

If you want to skip our overview of the current stock market climate, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Stocks Under $100 To Buy Now. ', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

This clique includes the following market leaders: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These companies have achieved outsize returns partly due to being pioneers, leaders, and innovators in their respective industries and delivering consistently strong financial results.', 'Though the Magnificent Seven stocks are a rare breed, some other corporations on the market would fit right into the fold and are most certainly worth investing in. If I had to create a ""Magnificent Nine,"" here are two stocks that would be prime candidates to join the existing seven: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).', ""Eli Lilly would be right at home among the Magnificent Seven in terms of stock market performance. Only Nvidia has performed better than the drugmaker in the past decade. The company has achieved strong returns largely due to its dominance in the market for diabetes drugs. For much of the past 10 years, Trulicity, a medicine for type 2 diabetes first approved in the U.S. in 2014, was Eli Lilly's most important growth driver."", 'Now, Eli Lilly has a new crown jewel: the clinical compound known as tirzepatide, marketed as either Mounjaro in treating diabetes or Zepbound in obesity. Tirzepatide arrived on the market in 2022, and sales have been growing rapidly. It generated more than $5 billion in revenue in 2023, its first full year on the market.', 'Some say it could hit annual peak sales of $25 billion on the back of a fast-growing anti-obesity drug market. Eli Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for decades where arguably the only drugmaker that has been able to keep up is Novo Nordisk. That\'s one more reason Eli Lilly belongs in a ""Magnificent Nine.""', ""Turning to the company's financial results, Eli Lilly's revenue and earnings have been excellent -- and that won't likely stop anytime soon. Analysts predict that, on average, Eli Lilly's earnings per share (EPS) will increase by 50.7% per year for the next five years."", ""Tirzepatide will play an important role here, but Eli Lilly's lineup is much broader than this one medicine. The drugmaker earned approval for some brand-new drugs last year, including cancer therapy Jaypirca and ulcerative colitis medicine Omvoh. This year, it could launch donanemab, a medicine for Alzheimer's disease."", ""In short, the company's overall prospects are rock-solid. Then, there is Eli Lilly's excellent dividend record. Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical giant has increased its payouts by 165%, which rivals Microsoft, the best dividend stock among the Magnificent Seven. That's just one more reason why Eli Lilly is a table-pounding buy."", ""Like several members of the Magnificent Seven, Netflix faced severe headwinds between 2021 and 2022. And like those same members of the Magnificent Seven, Netflix has bounced over the past year. The streaming specialist's stock performance in the past decade would be more or less middle of the pack within this group."", 'True, a lot has changed in 10 years for Netflix. It faces more competition than ever, with brand-new streaming platforms popping up left and right. However, having been the pioneer, Netflix remains one of the undisputed leaders in streaming.', ""As of December, Netflix accounted for 8% of television viewing time in the U.S. Only Alphabet's YouTube did better in the streaming world at 9%, and that's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison. YouTube for the most part features independently created videos, not the kinds of shows and movies people go on Netflix to watch. Regardless, Netflix is undoubtedly near the top of the industry, where plenty of white space remains."", 'In the U.S., one of the most penetrated markets, streaming made up just 36% of total television viewing time. That should keep increasing while other regions play catch-up. How long will the shift take? It might be a while. In the meantime, Netflix should continue delivering excellent financial results, just like it has in the past.', ""Here's one reason why: Netflix arguably benefits from the network effect. It uses the data it collects from viewers and their habits to craft its content creation strategy. The more viewers there are on its platforms, the more valuable it becomes. That's a big reason why Netflix's productions have been massively successful, whether in viewership or awards. Netflix's master plan will continue working even with more competition, as the company has shown in recent years."", 'The stock should still massively reward shareholders over the long run, making it a great Magnificent Nine candidate.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

That's true for some utilities, but NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) bucks the trend (in a good way). While NextEra operates a boring utility, it also owns a rapidly growing renewable power business."", ""For both growth and income and dividend growth investors, it's a great stock to consider. And now is a unique opportunity to buy it. Here's what you need to know."", ""NextEra Energy's dividend yield is around 3.5%. That's basically in line with the utility average, using Vanguard Utilities Index ETF as an industry proxy. While income-focused investors might see NextEra's yield as modest, it's important to note that the 3.5% yield is near the highest levels of the past decade. So in this way, the stock looks historically cheap right now."", ""That said, management expects to increase the dividend by roughly 10% in 2024, which is both attractive on an absolute level and extremely high for a utility. But that's right in line with the rate of dividend growth over the past decade. The dividend has been increased annually for 29 years, so an increase in 2024 would bring that record up to a cool three decades. NextEra Energy is a dividend growth machine, and there's no reason to think that the growth is going to come to a halt anytime soon."", ""Notably, management projects earnings growth of between 6% and 8% a year through 2026. There's a chance that dividend growth will slow down and simply track along with earnings growth, but even that would suggest an attractive dividend growth rate. This is particularly true of a utility stock."", ""That's notable because dividend growth investors and growth and income investors looking to create a diversified portfolio will probably find it hard to add utility exposure. Most stocks in the sector are simply slow-growing on the earnings and dividend fronts. NextEra Energy's historically high yield and robust growth outlook make the stock an ideal diversification pick for investors looking for something with a little more growth."", ""The really big reason for NextEra's high yield is that interest rates have risen. There are two issues for investors to consider here. First, other income options are now more competitive, like certificates of deposit. Second, and more importantly, higher interest rates will make it more expensive for NextEra to grow its business. The utility sector is capital-intensive and makes heavy use of leverage. Don't get too worried about this."", ""There are two distinct businesses here to consider. First, NextEra owns Florida Power & Light, which is the largest regulated utility in Florida and about 70% of the utility's business. The Sunshine State has benefited from population growth for years. More customers mean more revenue and more opportunity to invest in regulated assets. This is a very stable and reliable business, because NextEra has been granted a monopoly in exchange for accepting government oversight of the rates it charges and its capital investment plans. Regulators generally adjust so that utilities can earn a reliable return. Thus, it's highly likely that the rates NextEra can charge will eventually be updated to account for higher interest rates."", ""The rest of NextEra is NextEra Energy Resources, one of the largest renewable power generators in the world. This is a fast-growing business with a very long runway for growth as carbon-heavy power sources get replaced by renewable sources like solar and wind. NextEra currently operates around 34 gigawatts of clean energy. It has plans to add as much as 41.8 gigawatts to that total by 2026. This side of the business is not regulated, so higher interest rates will have to be dealt with on a contract-by-contract basis. Market forces are likely to ensure NextEra can profitably grow this side of its business even if there's some near-term disruption to deal with."", ""In all, higher interest rates are a headwind. But they're highly unlikely to change the long-term growth trajectory of NextEra and its dividend."", ""There's no such thing as a perfect investment, but the current concerns about NextEra's growth seem likely to be temporary and, perhaps, a little overblown. That's an opportunity for investors that think in decades. Growth-and-income and dividend growth-focused investors have the chance to add a reliable utility stock to their portfolios with a historically attractive yield. That's not something you should pass up without giving NextEra a deep dive."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the current stock market climate, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Stocks Under $100 To Buy Now. ', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.', 'The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.', ""According to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\xa0"", 'Meanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.', 'In this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue.

This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.46."", ""Finally, investors should note that TSN has a P/CF ratio of 14.91.

Instead, the ideas usually center around giant consumer goods companies, banks or utility firms – you know, institutions that are hardly exciting but command everyday relevance.', 'Still, it’s time to show some love to dividend tech stocks. Admittedly, with the furor regarding artificial intelligence and the blockchain these days, it’s easy to think that publicly traded innovators are all about capital gains. And that’s true for the usual suspects. However, dig around and you’ll find some compelling tech firms that pay you will you sleep.', 'Now, let me be 100% clear: I’m not suggesting you abandon the capital gains approach. After all, I’m a cryptocurrency investor. Saying that would be hypocritical. What I am saying is that don’t ignore the below dividend tech stocks. They’re mature enterprises but they certainly have their charm.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most valuable enterprises in the world due to its importance for the global computer chip supply chain. However, TSM may be getting a bit long in the tooth regarding its growth narrative. Analysts project shares to hit $138.83 on average, which is a very modest target.', 'Still, I appreciate TSM as one of the credible dividend tech stocks. First, Wall Street experts predict that 2024 sales will land at $84.76 billion, representing 22.1% growth on the top line. On the bottom line, they anticipate earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be $5.75. That’s a sizable gain from the $5.19 posted last year.', 'Again, that translates to a credible pathway for consistent passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward dividend yield of 1.65%. Granted, that’s only modestly higher from the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. However, the payout ratio sits at 29.71%, providing support for yield sustainability. Thus, TSM ranks among the dividend tech stocks to buy.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'A wireless communications powerhouse, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is widely known for its special brand of semiconductors. As well, it offers software and services tied to the broader wireless tech industry. As you might imagine, it’s been vital for the 5G rollout. Sure enough, QCOM has enjoyed a solid start to the new year. However, that also presents a bit of a challenge.', 'Currently, analysts peg QCOM a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $162.80, which at this moment means nothing. Granted, the high-side target is $180 but the reality is that QCOM may attract more as one of the dividend tech stocks rather than a capital gains play. That’s not a bad gig.', 'Analysts see 2024 sales landing at $38.09 billion. That represents a 6.3% lift from the $35.83 billion in sales printed last year. On the bottom line, Wall Street experts believe that Qualcomm could generate EPS of $9.73. Last year, this tally came out to $8.43.', 'Currently, the tech giant offers a forward yield of 1.98%. With 21 years of consecutive payout increases, QCOM is one of the dividend tech stocks to consider.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational corporation founded in Israel, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. In the open market, DOX is off to a decent start for an enterprise of its size. However, the company could really be best geared as a hybrid play.', 'What I mean by that is this: Amdocs offers a mixture of upside rewards and passive income. Per TipRanks, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $104.17 average price target. Also, the high-side target runs up to $115. Those are solid estimates.', 'On the financials, experts believe that company sales could hit $5.04 billion, representing a 3% gain from last year. Also, they anticipate EPS to land at $6.50, contrasting nicely with EPS of $5.91 in 2023.', 'In terms of passive income, Amdocs offers a forward dividend yield of 2.11%. It’s not blistering high but it’s conspicuously above the sector average of 1.37%. Also, the company commands 13 years of consecutive payout increases. Thus, it’s a worthwhile opportunity among dividend tech stocks.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Based in Canada, Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) develops and sells enterprise information management software.

Analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $48.40 average price target. Further, the high-side target runs to $53.', 'Those are solid estimates for most companies in terms of forward-12-month-looking forecasts. It’s also credible because Open Text ranks among the top dividend tech stocks. Per Wall Street experts, the company could see revenue of $5.93 billion at the conclusion of fiscal year 2024. That would come out to a 32.2% sales increase from last year.', 'In terms of profitability, analysts project EPS to land at $4.61 by year’s end. If so, that would be a huge leap from $3.29, posted in 2023. Turning to passive income, Open Text offers a forward yield of 2.64%. Also, the payout ratio sits at only 19.54%, providing confidence for yield sustainability. Thus, it’s an intriguing candidate for dividend tech stocks to buy.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'A data storage company, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is one of the top players in the hard disk drive (HDD) space. Notably, STX has gotten off to a solid start this year. Recently, Trexquant Investment LP took on a $1.36 million position in STX stock, demonstrating Seagate’s relevance and resilience amid huge changes in the tech ecosystem.', 'Just as well, the company is attempting to hold up the fort on the financial end of the spectrum. By the end of the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate that revenue will land at $6.5 billion. If so, that would lead to a $12 decline against last year’s tally of $7.38 billion. That’s not great. However, by 2025, they project sales to hit $8.66 billion. Moreover, the high-side estimate calls for sales of $9.75 billion.', 'Notably, though, EPS in 2024 should ping at 73 cents, well above last year’s 19-cent print. In turn, Seagate offers a forward yield of 2.84%. The payout ratio, while elevated at 58.71%, is reasonable. Therefore, investors interested in dividend tech stocks may want to give STX another look.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Based in Israel, Ituran Location and Control (NASDAQ:ITRN) provides stolen vehicle recovery and tracking services. In addition, it markets GPS wireless communication products. Given the rise in property theft – particularly regarding motor vehicles – ITRN stock could be cynically relevant. Admittedly, shares didn’t get off to a great start but the framework could easily change for the better.', 'Whether for cynical reasons or not, analysts anticipate rising growth for Ituran. By the end of this fiscal year, experts believe that the company will post revenue of $342.9 million. That would be up 7.2% from last year’s haul of just under $320 million. By the end of 2025, revenue could clock in at $377.7 million. That would be up over 10% from 2024’s projected sales.', 'On the bottom line, experts see ITRN’s EPS to land at $2.49 this year, an improvement over last year’s $2.40. In terms of passive income, Ituran carries a forward yield of 5.89%. Even better, the payout ratio is reasonable for such a high yield at 56.73%. Thus, it’s one of the tech dividend stocks to keep on your radar.', 'Source: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock', 'A fabless semiconductor manufacturer, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a name I’ve discussed extensively. Part of the reason is that – aside from its relevance – HIMX stock is undervalued. Right now, shares trade hands at 19.17X trailing-year earnings. That’s lower than almost 67% of the competition. It also trades at 1.17X tangible book value. That’s lower than nearly 83% of its peers.', 'Admittedly, analysts have some questions about 2024’s revenue performance, which may explain some of the disappointing price action. By the end of this year, experts believe that Himax will only print sales of $901.25 million. That would fall short of last year’s tally of $945.45 million by 4.7%. However, the good news is that they also believe revenue will land just above $982 million by 2025.', 'On the bottom line, analysts project 2024 EPS to be 35 cents, above last year’s 29-cent performance. And 2025 could land earnings of 48 cents per share. Subsequently, Himax’s forward dividend yield of 8.66% might seem excessively high. However, it appears to have the goods to back it up.', 'Finally, Robert W. Baird sees shares hitting $7 over the next 12 months.

However, in the long term, adhering to valuation principles pays off. Remember, in the long run, the major determinant of returns is the starting valuation. So, if you pay a lower multiple, you will likely have higher returns.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'According to this Finviz screen, these stocks are valued at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) below 10. They also grew sales by 5% quarter-over-quarter in the most recent quarter. Besides, EPS will increase by over 10% annually, driving long-term share price appreciation.', 'So, with this perspective, let’s look at some of the best bargain stocks to buy today.', 'Source: Chrispictures/Shutterstock.com', 'One of the best bargain stocks to buy is the largest custodian, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK). The robust custody bank plus a $1.97 trillion investment management business highlights the inherent quality of the business.', 'Last year, the bank saw a steep decline during the regional bank turmoil.

In 2023, the online travel agency recorded $12.8 billion in revenue, representing 10% growth. Additionally, it achieved a 21% EBITDA margin, generating $2.7 billion in EBITDA.', 'With more cost streamlining in 2024, management expects another record year of EBITDA.

As of Dec. 31, 2023, it had 463 aircraft in its fleet. Furthermore, it has over 200 established relationships with airlines in 70 countries. It is benefiting as airlines seek to replace aging aircraft with modern fuel-efficient jets.', 'Limited aircraft availability due to significant backlog at Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) means Air Lease will continue to benefit from increased leasing demand.

Further, it is trading at a significant discount to its book value at a price-to-book of 0.66.', 'Based on management comments, the fundamental outlook is bright.

Miller,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-deserves-better-open-221300106.html,1710367980,STORY,['CCI'],"[""Provides Detailed Operating Plan to Restore Operational Excellence, Bolster Leadership with Experienced Tower Professionals, Maximize Value of the Company's Fiber Business to Position Crown Castle as Premier Pure-Play Tower Company"", 'Believes Crown Castle Can be Worth at Least $150 in the Next 18 Months if Board Takes Immediate Action to Restore Leadership and Prevent Further Erosion of Shareholder Value', 'HOUSTON, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\xa0Ted B. Miller, co-founder of Crown Castle Inc., (NYSE: CCI) (""Crown Castle"" or the ""Company"") and his investment vehicle Boots Capital Management, LLC (""Boots Capital"") today issued the following open letter to the Crown Castle Board of Directors (the ""Board""), the Company\'s employees, and its shareholders:', 'This is a crucial moment for Crown Castle, its shareholders and employees. It\'s why we have recommended a slate of four directors who we believe will make a valuable difference with their world class experience, skills and leadership. While the Board has undergone significant change in recent years, this turnover has still left it lacking directors who have the depth of tower operating and public-company CEO experience essential to drive the Company forward. A need for comprehensive leadership change was also put forth by Elliott Investment Management L.P. (""Elliott"") in its November 27, 2023 letter to the Board.', 'At long last, Crown Castle is, after prodding from Elliott, studying the fate of its fiber business. Bankers and lawyers have been hired to do their typical work. That work together with a detailed plan for a fiber sale and a rerating of Crown Castle stock has been completed by Boots and offered to the Company without response.', 'But in our view the work does not stop there. Crown Castle is in dire need of a top-to-bottom reboot with trusted, long-term leadership. The Company needs a concrete plan for the fiber sale, and then an operational revival informed by people who live and breathe towers. We have devoted seven months to a vetted and detailed plan that we believe will create lasting value through a commitment to operational excellence.', 'We shared this detailed plan with the Board during a 90-minute meeting in January. Not surprisingly – since only one member of the Board has any experience as an executive of a tower business – there were a very limited number of questions raised, even then primarily asked by advisors. Meanwhile, many shareholders have responded to our approach and nominees with the response: ""Why wouldn\'t Crown Castle do this?"" Our nominees provide unrivaled tower-industry experience and expertise and offer a critical operational complement to the academic, legal, telecom-services and asset-management background of the current Board.', 'As a large shareholder, we expect the Board to have a laser focus on building shareholder value, rather than be involved in ""clever"" legal maneuvers such as the Cooperation Agreement with Elliott, which was hastily rewritten after we challenged it in court. That agreement is even under more scrutiny, after the Delaware Vice Chancellor hearing our case rejected a Company effort to delay the hearing of the case, saying last week that ""there are colorable claims"" to the way the Cooperation Agreement was struck. The court also said that the Company should give me advance notice to object should it hire a new CEO or sell the fiber unit.', ""The court's order should be a sign to all involved in this expensive and distracting litigation: That enough is enough. It's time to stop being adversaries and work together to improve the Company and all shareholder prospects, as we've intended all along."", 'To be clear: \xa0this is not ""a trade"" for me. I co-founded Crown Castle. I care deeply about the long-term success of the Company. And I am here for the long-term. With our plan, it\'s time to restore Crown Castle to its prominence as a pure-play tower company, and reestablish it as one of the most strategically important American companies.', 'Outlined below are details about what our four highly qualified nominees intend to do and why our multi-pronged operating plan to improve Crown Castle is value enhancing.', '1)\xa0Creating Value From the Fiber Sale', 'Based on our analysis, since the decision was made to invest in fiber, we believe the unit has required $22 billion of capital and continues to consume over a billion in capital expenditures each year – 2024 management guidance is $1.4 billion alone. The Board has announced that it is studying the possible sale of the fiber segment, and we also believe that the Board is weighing whether to sell the enterprise fiber business while retaining the small cells.', 'We have spent seven months modeling every possible structure for a sale of fiber from an operational, financial and tax perspective.', 'While the particulars of any transaction must be evaluated on their own merit, our work has given us a very clear point-of-view: there is much more value to be created by selling an estimated 75% interest in the entire fiber/small-cell portfolio, as it resets Crown Castle as a more capital-efficient tower operator.', 'There is a role for small cells in our industry, but our modeling revealed Crown Castle would earn an underwhelming return on its capital on the current fiber/small cells business through at least 2050.', 'A sale of the fiber business is essential for our intended value-creating path as a pure play tower company, with, in our view, a multiple of at least 25 times EBITDA compared to 18 times today.', 'Moreover, if the Company can conclude a fiber sale in 2024, we believe more than $1 billion can be saved in tax efficiencies. The Board nonetheless has ignored our hundreds of pages of thorough analysis, which could be leveraged by its advisors instead of recreating the wheel, and elected not to work with us to evaluate the details of the $1 billion in potential value that could be saved in tax efficiencies. When it comes to executing the fiber sale, time is literally money. And this Board is burning both.', 'We believe our carefully vetted approach creates the most value and best preserves a healthy, sustainable dividend.\xa0', '2) Maintaining a Healthy, Sustainable Dividend', 'The financials show that Crown Castle cannot support its current dividend trajectory while maintaining the small-cell buildout pace. In the last three years, Crown Castle has funded the dividend by incurring debt – an approach that we do not believe is sustainable.', 'We have a long-term plan – not a short-term trading strategy – to generate sustainable performance for all shareholders. Our approach will drive meaningful operational improvements to enhance margins, as outlined in our unredacted board presentation, which we released yesterday.', ""Our plan protects the underlying health of the dividend and the absolute dividend amount itself. Specifically, our plan offers the Company optionality to pay a $4.62 dividend solely out of cash flow (as outlined in our presentation) or incur an estimated $1.3b of debt in total between now and 2029 and sustain the dividend at its current $6.26 level. This creates soundness and flexibility around the dividend, about which we will continue to take soundings from the shareholder base. Either way, we believe our plan would materially improve Crown Castle's cash flow dynamics."", 'Our approach creates the most value and best preserves a healthy, sustainable dividend. With the fiber sale, we estimate this extra value to be an additional $40+ per share for Crown Castle shareholders.', '3) Restoring Operational Excellence\xa0', 'We have heard the question asked: \xa0Why do the shareholders need our slate if the Board has been recently reconstituted?', ""Start with a simple number. Crown Castle has a 12-person Board, yet only one of its members includes a tower business in their resume. The Board's sum of towers-operating experience from one board member is just seven years. And only one current director has been a public company CEO – of a bank. This is a $75 billion enterprise with virtually no senior leadership experience running either public or tower companies."", 'Our director candidates have over 50 combined years of direct and unrivaled leadership in the towers space and have created billions of dollars of value for investors. Three of us were at the founding of the industry itself, and have remained involved for the 30 years since. That sounds like exactly what Elliott had in mind in its December letter to the Board: ""How much more value destruction will this Board permit before finally taking action and changing the leadership of Crown Castle?""', ""Yet, over the past several years, much of Crown Castle's executive management team has stepped down, including its former CEO, CFO, and EVP/COO of towers. This Company must urgently attract and retain leaders with the experience, vision and confidence to execute the operational changes and tower-focused innovation necessary for a better future. This need is all the more acute because of a brain drain that has persisted at towers since the fiber investments began. We believe this pattern of departures, coupled with the fact that the Board had no succession plan – a primary obligation of any board – and is still in the process of conducting its CEO search, reflects a lack of leadership and operational capability at the management level as well as the failure of the Board's overall strategic initiatives."", ""Not all of Crown Castle's needed changes will be easy. Transformation must start from the top – from Board leadership. And that Board requires leaders with credibility, operational expertise, and a strong vision for the future at a difficult moment like this. Crown Castle employees want to feel like they're understood, and customers want to know they're being listened to. As founder and a substantial shareholder, I have a special perch from which to drive a cultural and operational reawakening, yet the Board continues to refuse to meaningfully engage with us or our value enhancing proposal."", 'We will keep fighting for our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and lenders, and for the future Crown Castle deserves.', '\xa0', 'INVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS', 'Investors:Morrow Sodali LLCPaul Schulman/William Dooley/Jonathan EylBy Phone: 1-800-662-5200 or 208-658-9400By Email: Boots@info.morrowsodali.com', 'Media:Jonathan Gasthalter/Nathaniel Garnick/Grace CartwrightGasthalter & Co.By Phone: 212-257-4170By Email: bootscapital@gasthalter.com', 'CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS', 'The information herein contains ""forward-looking statements.""

AI automation includes many processes. Those processes include robots performing repetitive tasks, known as repetitive process automation or RPA. That’s probably what most people envision when the word automation is discussed.\xa0Yet, AI automation also includes processes by which human thinking is mimicked as well as the automation of business process workflows. It’s a broad field with incredible potential and contains many stocks worth investing in.', 'Artificial intelligence is the most important topic currently. It will continue to be the most important topic for years to come.', 'Naturally, investors are highly curious to understand the investing landscape and the companies and stocks therein. These firms and their stocks are poised to transform the labor market. AI automation will affect the labor market.

However, Nvidia is concurrently making major strides in the robotics solutions realm, which is more traditionally associated with AI automation. Nvidia offers\xa0an end-to-end Robotics platform to train and deploy AI-enabled robots at scale.

The robots, software and design tools it sells will be in high demand as AI continues to be applied to factory settings in particular. It’s fair to assume that companies like Rockwell Automation will be responsible for the loss of blue-collar jobs.

The fact that Nvidia revealed an investment in the firm served to affirm what many had already suspected: Conversational AI is rife with potential.', 'The excitement around SoundHound AI is likely to only run higher following the company’s earnings report on Feb. 29.

Whether by ChatGPT, through CoPilot or its Power Automate business process automation technology, it is a force. That simple truth is but another reason to consider adding Microsoft stock to your portfolio if you haven’t already.', 'Chat GPT and CoPilot are more recent and better known than Microsoft Power Automate. So, let’s start with the latter. It is essentially software as a service used to automate business processes and has been around since 2019. It is part of the broader set of tools known as AI automation but is essentially business process automation. In any case, it is another part of the broader offering of Microsoft in relation to automation and AI.', 'One of the more salient questions about Microsoft at the moment is how much further it can rise.

But in the meantime, there are other quality dividend stocks that have sold off but are still maintaining or even increasing their payouts.

Suppose it isn't supply chain difficulties challenging its ability to ramp up airplane production in line with its medium-term plans. In that case, manufacturing quality issues and the need for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audit into Boeing and its fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems production have the same impact."", ""With all that said, despite all its difficulties, Boeing is still winning orders and has a backlog of almost 5,600 airplanes. It's not a question of if Boeing will deliver on the backlog, but more of a question of when and with how much profit margin."", ""Boeing's plan, outlined on its investor day in November 2022, is to ramp up its 737 production rate to 50 planes a month and its 787 production rate to 10 airplanes a month in 2025 and 2026. In doing so, Boeing plans to hit $10 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the time period."", ""While recent events have probably pushed back the date it will\xa0 hit the $10 billion FCF level within that window, Wall Street still thinks Boeing will do so by the end of 2026.

While I think there are better ways to invest in the sector than buying Boeing, the stock will still interest value investors."", ""Scott Levine (California Water Service Group): Shares of California Water Service have plunged by about 11% since the start of the year. The third-largest regulated water utility by market capitalization, California Water Service has fallen out of favor with investors due to the uncertainty regarding its 2021 General Rate Case and a disappointing fourth-quarter 2023 earnings report. While unwelcome, these two factors should hardly be sufficient to dissuade income investors from picking up shares of California Water Service, which at their current price sport a 2.4%-yielding dividend -- especially given the company's track record of rewarding investors."", ""Regulated water utilities can't arbitrarily start charging customers more whenever they see fit. They must instead undergo General Rate Cases -- formal proceedings under which they request permission from the relevant public utility commissions and regulators to charge higher rates. It's understandable, therefore, that investors are frustrated with the lack of clarity regarding the California Public Utilities Commission's view of the company's 2021 General Rate Case. Given their lack of confidence that the company will be allowed to charge higher rates, investors are likely concerned that management doesn't have the same insight into its future cash flows, a factor that may affect the company's ability to sustain its dividend."", ""But this isn't California Water Service's first rodeo. Founded in 1926, the company has an impressively long track record of annual dividend hikes: 56 straight years, a streak that makes it a Dividend King. Surely, the company has faced uncertainty regarding General Rate Cases before, and, despite this, management's prowess at navigating turbulent waters has still left the company able to raise the dividend every year. That record of past performance provides no guarantee that it will continue hiking its payout annually in the future, but it does inspire confidence that management will be able to navigate the current challenges."", 'With shares valued at 13 times operating cash flow, just below its 5-year average cash flow multiple of 13.1, now seems like a great time to pick up shares of California Water Service.', ""Daniel Foelber (Deere): It's been a rough start to the year for Deere. The stock is down more than 6% year to date and has gone practically nowhere for the last three years. But zoom out a bit further, and you'll see that Deere has delivered explosive growth over the last five years, including tripling its net income."", ""A lot of the stock's gains came in 2020 and the first half of 2021. But the earnings growth came in the years that followed. Deere's recent performance illustrates why cyclical stocks can sometimes behave strangely."", ""Orders were flooding in for Deere's products. The business was booming. But over the last couple of quarters, its top line went flat and then started to slightly decline. For example, in its fiscal 2024 Q1 (which ended Jan. 29), net sales fell 8% year over year. And diluted earnings per share fell 5%."", 'Even worse, Deere is forecasting fiscal 2024 net income of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion. For context, it earned a record $10.2 billion in its fiscal 2023 and $7.1 billion in its fiscal 2022. So the earnings are falling just as quickly as they rose.', 'Over the last few years, investors have grown accustomed to Deere beating expectations. Now, the opposite is true. When it delivered its fiscal 2023 Q4 report in late November, Deere forecast fiscal 2024 net income of $7.75 billion to $8.25 billion, which is above its updated range. Investors already expect earnings to decline, but the market hates surprises. Deere needs to find its footing and prove that this is just another slowdown.', 'The best cyclical companies have a way of notching higher lows and higher highs. In other words, the lowest year of earnings during each downturn is higher than the low during the previous cyclical downturn. And each expansion period contains new record highs. Deere has plenty of long-term growth ahead and is an underrated artificial intelligence (AI) company -- it consistently commits a lot of capital to research and development to prepare for the next evolution of agriculture.', 'It has been a winning strategy to buy Deere when it begins to fall out of favor on Wall Street. And although management has prioritized growth over its stock repurchases and dividend payouts, the stock still has a respectable yield of 1.6% at the current price.

So how does CEO Dave Calhoun still have a job?', '“It’s become an extreme embarrassment,” Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aviation analyst, told me. “The board seems weirdly absentee, investors seem weirdly complacent, and the government doesn’t seem to have a mechanism for dealing with this.”', 'Let’s step back: Boeing’s (BA) stock has shed more than a quarter of its value this year, and it’s only March. One of its planes suffered a mid-flight blowout on January 5, prompting multiple federal investigations that increasingly suggest Boeing workers failed to put crucial bolts in place after making repairs. Last week, investigators called the company out for dragging its heels in response to their requests for key evidence.', 'Boeing said it is working closely with regulators’ investigations and has plans in place to improve safety measures at its production facilities.', '“We will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident,” Boeing said in a statement.', 'Boeing’s 737 Max problems would be egregious enough on their own.', 'But wait, there’s more.', 'On Monday, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flying from Australia to New Zealand plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring 50 passengers before landing safely. On Tuesday, news began emerging that a Boeing whistleblower, John Barnett, died in an apparent suicide on the same day he was scheduled to give testimony about safety concerns he raised over the company’s safety protocols.', 'It’s not clear whether Boeing bears any responsibility in either case. The company said it was gathering information about what went wrong on the 787. And in response to its former employee’s death, the company said: “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”', 'If Boeing were any other company, its CEO would be out the door. But Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive since 2020, remains in his job, as does the entire C-suite at the time of this writing.', '“It’s been three years of ‘there’s no way Calhoun can stay at the helm,’” said Aboulafia, managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. “But he seems to be staying at the helm … I do not get it.”', 'Boeing actually raised Calhoun’s total compensation in 2022, to $22.5 million, despite problems with the 777 program and quality control issues with the 787 that forced regulators to halt the company’s deliveries. Calhoun’s 2023 compensation has not yet been announced — Boeing typically reveals that information in April.', 'To be fair to Calhoun, he took over a company in deep distress following two fatal 737 Max crashes that landed the crucial plane in a nearly two-year-long grounding and put the company in a yearslong crisis. And the plane maker’s problems didn’t start there: The 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas is widely cited as Boeing’s poisoned chalice. It was after the merger that the bean-counter executives began taking over, gutting the joint, and putting accountants into roles once held by engineers. Maximizing profit took precedence over quality. In the short term, margins improved. But in the long term, Boeing lost the plot.', 'Executives at Boeing, starting in the mid-aughts, “identified an industry with tons of cash flow, high barriers to entry and only two players,” Aboulafia said, referring to Boeing’s European rival, Airbus. “It’s a recipe for getting away with bad things.”', 'Critics of the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 weren’t just a problem of flawed design but also deeply flawed management that eroded Boeing’s corporate culture.', 'Boeing hired Calhoun to right the ship and help return the plane maker to its engineering roots. Some questioned the move at the time, given that Calhoun himself was trained as an accountant and has no engineering background. Calhoun, who previously worked at the Blackstone Group, Nielsen and GE, was cut from the same cloth as Jim McNerney, who ran Boeing as CEO from 2005-2015, a tumultuous era marked by strained labor relations and cost-cutting.', 'Under Calhoun, Boeing still hasn’t been able to shake its enormous problems. This year’s mounting concerns prove his efforts haven’t resulted in sufficient quality and safety improvements.', 'CNN has reached out to Boeing for comment.', '“If you ask me, the first thing that needs to happen for Boeing to gain trust is to basically fire the entire C suite,” Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, told me Tuesday. “I know that will not happen, but … there is not a single person that has a C in front of their title that is not responsible for what we’re seeing now.”', 'But Allon isn’t holding his breath for Boeing’s board of directors to act.', '“If there is a functioning board, that’s what should happen.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. For example, the Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) share price is up a whopping 550% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. And in the last month, the share price has gained 14%. We note that Quanta Services reported its financial results recently; luckily, you can catch up on the latest revenue and profit numbers in our company report.

One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""During five years of share price growth, Quanta Services achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 45% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Quanta Services' TSR for the last 5 years was 560%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""It's good to see that Quanta Services has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 56% in the last twelve months.

If you want to skip our overview of the current stock market climate, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Stocks Under $100 To Buy Now. ', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

If so, you\'re not alone. The market was looking overbought and overpriced a couple of months ago. Now it\'s showing signs of weakness, perhaps weighed down by steep valuations and profit-taking pressure. Even a few of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks aren\'t looking so magnificent anymore.', ""This isn't a reason to simply step away from the entire stock market though. Rather, it's an opportunity to ferret out new picks that may not have been great performers of late, but still offer great long-term upside potential."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three stocks I'm thinking about adding to my retirement account this month. And yes, these are names that I see as being better-suited picks for an IRA than a conventional brokerage account. I'll tell you why."", ""Fastly (NYSE: FSLY) isn't a household name. There's a good chance, however, you or someone in your household regularly relies on its service."", ""In simplest terms, Fastly helps companies that manage cloud computing platforms and cloud-based apps do their jobs better. It supports businesses that deal with streaming, financial services, e-commerce, video gaming, and more, providing cybersecurity solutions, data load optimization, and a wide range of edge computing solutions just to name a few. (Edge computing just means any computing that can be handled by an end user's device rather than by a remote server.) Forrester Research even named Fastly Compute a top edge development platform for 2023. Its client list includes Reddit, SpaceX, Stripe, and plenty of other familiar names."", 'The proof, of course, is in the numbers. How is Fastly doing?', ""The stock's not been doing all that well of late, actually. It soared in 2020, when pandemic lockdowns forced the world to live most of their lives online. The advance was much too far and too fast though. Shares are down 90% from their late-2020 high, as investors struggled to support its frothy valuation. Indeed, Fastly isn't profitable, and it still isn't expected to become so this year."", ""Now take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Revenue hasn't failed to grow in any quarter since 2020, pushing the company ever closer to profitability. It's still doing so well, in fact, that this year's and then next year's projected top-line growth of nearly 16% should translate into its first-ever actual profit in 2025. Don't be surprised to see shares start reflecting that possibility before it actually happens, though. After all, stocks have a funny way of moving in anticipation of the future, particularly when there's a new CEO at the helm."", 'This technology pick is probably a little more aggressive and higher-risk than most investors might normally pick for their retirement portfolios. But, its service/product has a decidedly bright long-term future. Polaris Market Research and Global Market Insights both suggest the worldwide edge computing market is going to grow by an average of more than 30% per year through 2030.', ""There's a good chance you've never heard of StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE), albeit for a different reason than the one that's kept Fastly off of your radar. That is, this company doesn't serve the North American market. The entirety of its business is done within Brazil."", ""Simply put, StoneCo helps small and medium-sized businesses better manage the money-related aspects of their operations. Online and offline sales platforms, payment-acceptance tools, and even basic banking services including lines of credit are all part of its offerings. Compare it to more familiar platforms like Block -- formerly Square -- or PayPal, except built from the ground up to meet the unique needs of Brazil's small businesses."", ""It can be a bit unnerving to invest in a foreign company. Not only are these organizations less visible to you, but it's also difficult to keep tabs on overseas economies. Yet, most investors do know that several South American and Latin American countries are currently experiencing some significant social and economic turmoil. This pick isn't for the completely casual, passive investor."", 'But, maybe this is a case where you just hold your nose and dive in.', ""See, Brazil may be something of an underestimated bright spot in the region. The International Monetary Fund believes the country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth will roll in at a respectable 1.7% this year, slightly accelerating its growth pace as of late last year. In the meantime the United States' International Trade Administration expects Brazil's e-commerce market to grow by 14.3% between now and 2026, while GSMA Intelligence predicts that 83% of Brazil's adult residents will own smartphones by 2025. By 2030, the number of Brazilians with 5G mobile connections could be quintupled compared to today's penetration, making mobile commerce fast and easy. This tailwind plays right into the hand StoneCo is holding."", 'Or, if nothing else, look at it like this: StoneCo is a smart way of adding some much-needed international exposure to your mix of stocks.', ""Last but not least, I'm looking at Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) as a potential pick for my retirement account."", ""The pharmaceutical giant's stock has been a particularly poor performer of late. It's been more than halved from its late-2021 high, in fact, and is still dancing with multiyear lows."", ""Mostly blame the effective wind-down of the coronavirus pandemic vaccine market. Pfizer co-developed one of the preferred COVID-19 vaccines with biopharma drug company BioNTech in addition to offering a couple of its own treatments. As the contagion abates though, so does demand. Last year's top line slumped 41% year over year, for perspective."", ""Dig deeper into the details, however. Not counting COVID-19-related revenue, Pfizer's sales were actually up 7% in 2023. More forward progress is in the cards, too. The company's 2024 guidance suggests Pfizer will see slight sales growth, while earnings growth should be a marked rebound from 2023's lull."", ""That's still just the beginning. All told, in addition to a portfolio that already includes blockbuster drugs like pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, blood thinner Eliquis, and oncology drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, Pfizer's got 106 clinical drug trials underway, plus six New Drug Applications waiting for regulatory review. Of the 106 trials, 31 of them are in their third and final phase of testing. Meanwhile, the recently completed acquisition of Seagen sets the stage for an expansion of Pfizer's cancer drug portfolio later this year."", ""Admittedly, the company's long-term growth potential is subpar. That's largely a function of its sheer size; it's tough to grow much when you're already generating billions of dollars' worth of annual revenue with dozens of different drugs."", ""What Pfizer doesn't offer in growth, though, it offers in income. The stock's sizable, overbaked pullback has beefed up its reliable dividend's yield up to a little more than 6%. I don't need the investment income at this time, but I'll gladly add those cash payments to my retirement account right now to fund the purchase of other stocks in my IRA later."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Fastly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Fastly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Fastly wasn’t one of them.

Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits."", ""Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Today, the stock still trades for around $60 per share.', ""But make no mistake: PayPal stock hasn't been quiet. Between 2017 and today, the shares zoomed beyond the $300 mark, only to give up all of the gains."", 'Is this a busted growth story? Or can PayPal stock go on another run from $60 to $300?', 'PayPal as a business needs little introduction. The company has more than 400 million people who use the payment platform as a trusted way to buy and sell things online, or transfer money between friends and family.', ""Long owned by eBay, PayPal became an independent company in 2015. During the next five years, its user base more than doubled from 180 million to around 380 million. At its peak -- the fourth quarter of 2020 -- PayPal's user count was growing by 24% year over year."", ""Also in 2015, eBay ended its partnership with PayPal, moving its backend payments to a competing service while deemphasizing PayPal as a payment method. From that moment, PayPal's quarterly user growth rate began to fall. In the third quarter of 2023, growth turned into a decline. For the first time, PayPal's user based was shrinking."", ""PayPal's stock price reflects these wild swings in user figures. On a price-to-sales basis -- an easy way to roughly gauge the valuation of a growth stock -- PayPal shares trade at their cheapest levels ever."", ""Of course, there's a strong rationale behind the depressed valuation. The declining user base is the primary cause, but the company has also destroyed tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value over the years by repurchasing more than $20 billion in stock, all at prices much higher than today."", ""PayPal stock is priced near all-time lows for a reason, but if you're willing to take a little risk, there could be huge upside in betting on a turnaround."", 'Many growth stocks experience periods of slowing growth. When this happens, the share price almost always takes a huge hit. Growth stocks typically come with pricey valuation multiples, and when the market grows disillusioned, these multiples can come down fast.', 'Consider one of the largest companies in the world: Meta Platforms. After years of impressive growth, its user base stagnated in 2021. In Q3 of that year, the company had 2.81 billion daily users across its entire network. In Q4, it eked out its lowest growth rate in years, ending with just 2.82 billion daily users.', ""Meta stock -- like PayPal stock -- was punished, losing around two-thirds of its value. And then something amazing happened: Growth rates picked up, returning toward historical norms. Priced at a steep discount due to worries that the business would soon start shrinking, Meta's stock price exploded. Those who took a risk when growth rates were low could have made three times their investment in less than two years."", ""Could the same revival happen to PayPal stock today? That's the big question on everyone's mind. It should be noted that PayPal's user base has already begun shrinking on a total user count level, whereas Meta's active user base was merely stagnating."", ""Additionally, Meta is arguably more diversified. For example, it can supplement struggling Facebook user growth with Instagram user growth. PayPal's business is a standalone, and its only avenue for growth right now is to persuade more people and businesses to use its payment platform."", 'Still, PayPal has several factors working in its favor, the biggest of which is high levels of free cash flow. Last quarter, the company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow. During the past decade, quarterly free cash flow has averaged nearly $900 million.', ""While its user base is shrinking, its relatively asset-light business model provides it with enough cash flow to reinvest in new growth initiatives. Its new Fastlane feature, for example, promises to reduce checkout times by up to 40% by leveraging data from the company's huge user base. Since checkout times are a critical metric for online merchants, new innovations like this could spur increased adoption of PayPal as a preferred method of payment."", 'Ample free cash flow also lets PayPal repurchase more of its stock. Although these share repurchases have destroyed shareholder value in the past, the current stock buyback program -- totaling about $5 billion -- will be executed at significantly lower prices. If growth rates begin to tick up, PayPal could add fuel to the fire by repurchasing shares at an all-time low valuation.', ""Is PayPal stock a buy today? If you're willing to take a little risk, the shares offer plenty of upside potential. Similar to what happened with Meta, the market has given up on the stock, preferring to value it as a stagnating business. That's true...for now. If growth rates reverse course or even begin to plateau, we should see a quick rebound in the stock price. The shares look like a buy for risk-tolerant investors."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.', 'Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.', 'P/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.', 'It is calculated as below:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH, Ford Motor Company F and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 11 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

The series gives consumers and investors an inside look into the innovative thinking and diverse life experiences of some of the biggest players in business to find out how they lead through change, and how they define success for themselves and their organizations.', 'For more on our Lead This Way series, click here, and tune in to Yahoo Finance Live for more expert insight and the latest market action, Monday through Friday.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Brooks."", '- When your sister-run a noodle company hits grocery shelves nationwide.', ""VANESSA PHAM: When I was a kid and I was like always trying to like hide my lunch or I just didn't want people to come over when my mom was making something particularly aromatic. Fast forward to today where I get a chance to proudly put this in front of the country."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: The types of aromatic dishes Vanessa Pham once tried to hide from the world are now on full display in vibrant packaging on the shelves of major retailers. The brand's colorful journey is also on full display across the internet, thanks to Pham's now-tell-the-world attitude."", 'VANESSA PHAM: Every time I go into the grocery store, I always got to take the phone out and do like the selfie video. It always feels surreal.', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Omsom is a sauce and noodles startup partnering with prominent Asian chefs to offer premium authentic flavors. This isn't your usual microwavable instant noodles you might think of. A huge step Vanessa and her sister, Kim, say as part of their personal mission, to shake up ethnic aisles at grocery stores and bring these dishes to the mainstream."", ""But the recipe to get here, well, it wasn't a simple one. A global pandemic, Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, and the challenges any 24-year-old would face leading a brand new startup all stood in the way of her vision and mission of spreading her values and culture through the love of food."", '[MUSIC PLAYING]', 'Tell us what Omsom means. I mean, that in itself just symbolizes so much of the mission.', 'VANESSA PHAM: Omsom is actually based on a Vietnamese word ""om som."" And in, Vietnamese it means rowdy, rambunctious, riotous. It\'s actually a negative term. It\'s what our parents would use when they were trying to scold us. And Kim and I were really inspired by that energy. What if we turn that on its head and celebrate that aspect of who we are?', 'And Omsom is all about being proud and loud, especially when the stereotype of Asian-Americans in America is kind of like submissive or docile. Omsom is our true kind of energy and ethos and spirit.', 'BROOKE DIPALMA: While hiking in Bolivia in 2018 with her more free-spirited sister, the once-risk-averse Pham decided to lean into what she felt was her true ethos and leave her steady consulting career behind.', 'VANESSA PHAM: We instantly circled around the mission and the industry. And the mission is to educate on multitudes within Asian America, honor and celebrate Asian cuisines and flavors, and the industry just had to be food, because, for us, it was a love language, It was how we first like really learn to engage with our culture as Vietnamese-Americans and daughters of refugees.', 'BROOKE DIPALMA: With nothing more than what the two sisters had in the bank, they set out on their mission to create something unique. Embracing their roots was a catalyst to create Omsom as they saw an opportunity to tap into the ethnic food market, which is set to reach $84.7 billion by 2034. And investors saw the opportunity, too, as a number of them, including the co-founder of the luggage company Away, Jen Rubio, founder of the online wedding platform, Zola, Shan-Lyn Ma, and former Whole Foods executive turned-VC founder, Eli Truesdell of New Fair Partners, helped fund the Pham sisters vision. For Pham, embracing her personality, well, that was how she learned to lead the brand.', ""You see yourself as more of a risk forward leader now. Do you feel like you're tapping in to that mission?"", ""VANESSA PHAM: I would say that the person who I was when we were first building Omsom is very different than the person I am today. I think my proud and loud has actually been embracing who I am, which is very sensitive, very empathetic, lots of feelings, and learning to see that that's a huge strength as a leader if I don't make myself wrong for that or suppress that."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: You also founded the company at such a young age. I think you were, what, 24?', 'VANESSA PHAM: I was 24.', 'BROOKE DIPALMA: 24?', 'VANESSA PHAM: A baby, a baby, yeah.', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: How did you push through that noise and say, I may be young, but I'm making a difference?"", ""VANESSA PHAM: Yeah. I would say the loudest noise was actually my own self-doubt at the time. And so so much of this journey has been actually working with my kind of inner narratives and dialogue. And now I think I'm kind of my own hype woman, so."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: A hype woman with a core team who have helped her create not just food products, but an environment fueled by the brand's identity and Pham's own energetic outlook-- something she has embedded in the culture."", 'VANESSA PHAM: Everybody here is incredibly talented, incredibly driven, and, I think, enlivened by the mission of awesome and I absolutely lean on the team. I think a strong leader must and should trust and empower those that work with them. I learned from the team every single day.', '[MUSIC PLAYING]', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Pham's journey in starting Omsom has definitely been a learning experience. As they sort out the right manufacturing partner, which they found in Chicago, back in Brooklyn, another huge lesson came their way-- how to launch a specialty food business in the middle of a global pandemic."", ""VANESSA PHAM: When we started out building Omsom, we were just wide-eyed. We didn't know what could come. And before we even launched, the first big challenge came. Do we launch in the midst of this pandemic, at the start of it? Or do we pause and wait it out?"", ""And what we realize is that folks during this time are going to be at home. They're going to be wanting to feel a sense of connection and home. And we felt like, that's what Omsom is all about. I think we did make the right decision despite some folks warning us that it could be a difficult time."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Who were those folks, those investors, those people who backed you? How did you push over that?', ""VANESSA PHAM: One of my philosophies as a leader is you've got this whole kind of network of folks, whether they're investors or other folks. And I believe it's so important to take in their input, their advice, and their experience like a sponge. But at the end of the day, coming together with your team, centering your values and finding the best path forward for the company is really-- you know, that power is yours. We decided this was the time that we wanted to bring this company to the world."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Just three years after launching during COVID, Pham faced another major obstacle.', ""- Regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank. The FDIC has taken control of the bank deposits. So what's the fallout, the ripple effects?"", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Leaving the startup without access to their capital right before the brand was scheduled to launch their second product line-- saucy noodles.', 'VANESSA PHAM: Nothing can really prepare you for that type of uncertainty. I immediately had to figure out what our options were. And at the same time, Kim and I started working together on how we wanted to communicate what was going on to our community. We wanted to center our values around transparency and around bringing them in.', 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Pham and her sister were transparent with their community in a way that you might expect from the young founders-- on social media.', 'VANESSA PHAM: We did not know what would happen in the coming days. And so we put our heads together that Saturday morning and wrote something from the heart.', ""Running a proud and loud business doesn't always mean being celebratory. So let's talk about how SVB's collapse poses a major existential threat to many small businesses, including Omsom."", 'I think while we were still very scared and nervous, we felt deeply heartened by the people that showed up for us.', 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Talk about what values you hold closest to you as a leader.', ""VANESSA PHAM: One of the values that I've really centered in my journey as a leader is being heart forward, which is something that I don't think was necessarily historically celebrated in leadership. It was about being decisive, being kind of just leading with certainty and confidence, sometimes at the expense of your humanity."", ""And I feel like, at the early stages of my journey, I tried that on. And I was always making mistakes when I was in that head space of being something that I wasn't. And so the last couple of years, I've started to accept more of who I am in my leadership. If I'm working on something in my own journey, I'm open to sharing that. And I hope that invites people to feel confident and accepted in who they are at Omsom, too."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: When your team thinks of you as a leader, what do you hope is the message that you're getting across?"", ""VANESSA PHAM: I really hope that everybody at Omsom feels valued for who they are and what they bring to the table, and that they feel they have room to learn to sometimes make mistakes. It's about celebrating your truth and exactly what makes you you. I want Omsom to be the type of place where people are learning and expanding but also feeling great pride in their kind of natural strengths."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Pham and her team are determined to fill a white space. Think Cava and how it's setting out to fill the White space for fast casual Mediterranean food, or what Chipotle has done for fast casual Mexican cuisine. And now Omsom aims to fill the void for premium authentic Asian flavors in the packaged food market. That market is expected to grow around 50% globally by 2030."", ""And while Omsom doesn't disclose its finances publicly, the suggested retail price for its saucy noodles and its cooking sauces range from nearly $4 to $5. Since launch, the brand has sold 4 million products and expanded its presence to over 2,000 stores without losing sight of its roots."", ""Pham isn't satisfied yet though, far from it. She wants, in her own words, proud and loud Asian flavors to be mainstream."", 'VANESSA PHAM: I want to see Omsom become a cultural force, a household name, that continues to honor Asian-American communities and flavors and culture every single day. I want us to be in homes across the country but still hold that ethos and that heart that we do today.', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: An ethos and heart that Pham and her sister inherited from their parents, who, as refugees, weren't able to take the same kinds of risks."", 'Your parents must be so proud of you. What do you think they think about all that you have done?', ""VANESSA PHAM: They tell us all the time, which I really appreciate. They tell us that we are honoring our family history by the work that we do. And because they're refugees and they've built the life we have today, I-- it is my biggest life's dream to honor them and do right by them."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: If there is one moment that really felt like, wow, I made it, we did it, what would that moment be?', ""VANESSA PHAM: It's When we've shown that people who helped to get us here what we've done. And so it's really my grandparents. We were featured in a spread in Elle Vietnam. And it's written in Vietnamese. So I cannot wait to bring it to them, because they can read it and really understand that. And that'll be the moment I think when it really hits me, you know, what we've accomplished.""]"

There are lots of reasons, of course. The retailer operates nearly 2,000 stores in convenient locations across the U.S. It offers a wide range of merchandise under one roof. Target's stores are bright, clean, and well-organized, making it easy for customers to find what they want."", ""However, arguably, the biggest reason customers shop at Target is that its prices are reasonable for the quality of the products in its stores.

Is it a no-brainer buy right now?"", ""Target's share price popped 11% higher last week after reporting its 2023 fourth-quarter results. The big story of this Q4 update was that the company posted earnings per share (EPS) that reflected year-over-year growth of nearly 58%."", ""Even better, Wall Street wasn't expecting such strong earnings growth. Target's adjusted EPS of $2.98 was well above the consensus analysts' estimate of $2.40 and the high end of the company's guidance range of $1.90 to $2.60. The retailer topped estimates by a double-digit percentage in each quarter of 2023."", ""Granted, there were some things investors didn't like about Target's Q4 update. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose by only 1.7% year over year to $31.9 billion. This increase was driven largely by an extra week in fiscal year 2023."", ""Target's guidance was also weak. The company expects comparable sales in the first quarter of 2024 to fall by 3% to 5%. The midpoint of its Q1 EPS outlook reflects a decline from the prior-year period as well."", ""Looking beyond Target's recent quarterly update, the company arguably hits the bulls-eye for investors in several other ways. Its dividend ranks high on the list."", 'Target has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years. Its dividend has grown by an annualized average of 10.7% over the last 10 years -- an impressive growth rate. Target\'s dividend yield currently tops 2.6%. CFO and COO Michelle Fiddelke stated in the Q4 earnings call that Target plans to ""build on"" its strong track record of dividend hikes going forward.', 'Investors can expect Target to reward them in another way, too. Fiddelke said in the Q4 call that stock buybacks ""will continue to play a meaningful role in our EPS growth in years ahead."" She hinted that more share repurchases could be on the way later in 2024.', 'Importantly, Target\'s management maintains a long-term perspective. CEO Brian Cornell told analysts in the Q4 call, ""Our preference is always to think long-term."" He noted that the company plans to open more than 300 new stores over the next decade and remodel most of its existing stores. Target intends to build at least 10 new supply chain facilities. It\'s investing in technology, especially in using artificial intelligence (AI) to gain efficiencies and better serve customers.', ""I bought Target stock not long before its Q4 update. It wasn't a no-brainer buy for me then; I don't think it is now either."", ""Growth investors can definitely find other stocks that they'll like more than Target. Income investors can find stocks with juicier dividends. Value investors can find cheaper stocks. Target, therefore, isn't a no-brainer stock to buy."", ""That said, I think it's a stock that many investors will want to consider. In particular, anyone hoping to retire in the next 10 years or so might do well buying Target shares now.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with TGT.', ""On March 13, 2024, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) released its annual 10-K filing, revealing a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic direction. As the nation's sixth-largest retailer, Target has experienced significant growth, with sales exceeding $100 billion and a substantial market capitalization of $62.2 billion as of mid-2023. The company's success is rooted in its commitment to providing a gratifying shopping experience and a diverse product range that resonates with an affluent consumer base. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the latest SEC filing, offering investors a nuanced understanding of Target's market position and future prospects."", 'Robust Brand and Market Presence: Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) has established a formidable brand identity, characterized by its ""Expect More.

With over 1,900 stores strategically located in key urban and suburban markets, Target has become a staple in American retail, attracting a loyal customer base. The company\'s brand strength is further bolstered by its owned and exclusive brands, which account for about one-third of total sales and often yield higher margins than national brands. This brand equity not only drives customer loyalty but also provides a competitive edge in the crowded retail space.', ""Efficient Supply Chain and Fulfillment Network: Target's supply chain is a testament to its operational excellence, with stores fulfilling more than 96 percent of total sales. This efficiency not only enhances the shopping experience by ensuring product availability but also reduces fulfillment costs. The company's distribution network, which includes a mix of distribution centers and direct vendor shipments, is designed to optimize inventory management and minimize markdowns. The agility of Target's supply chain allows for rapid response to market demands and contributes to the company's overall financial strength."", ""Dependence on Physical Footprint: Despite the growth in digital sales, Target's business model remains heavily reliant on its physical stores. This dependence poses a risk in an increasingly digital retail landscape where consumer preferences are swiftly shifting towards online shopping. The company must continue to invest in its digital channels and fulfillment services to maintain relevance among consumers who favor convenience and speed over the traditional in-store experience."", ""Challenges in Rapidly Changing Consumer Preferences: Target's success in the fashion and home goods segments hinges on its ability to anticipate and quickly adapt to changing consumer trends. Failure to accurately forecast these trends can lead to inventory misalignment, resulting in excess stock or stockouts, which can negatively impact sales and profitability. As consumer behavior continues to evolve, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Target must enhance its data analytics and trend forecasting capabilities to stay ahead of the curve."", 'Expansion of Digital and Omnichannel Capabilities: The ongoing shift towards e-commerce presents a significant opportunity for Target to expand its digital footprint and omnichannel offerings. By leveraging its strong brand and customer base, Target can further develop its online platforms, mobile app, and same-day fulfillment services to meet the growing demand for convenience and immediacy. Enhancing digital capabilities will not only drive sales growth but also strengthen customer engagement and loyalty in the long term.', ""Strategic Partnerships and Exclusive Collaborations: Target has a history of successful partnerships with renowned brands and designers, which have differentiated its product offerings and attracted new customers. The company's collaborations with Apple, Disney, Levi's, and Ulta Beauty, among others, create unique shopping experiences and drive traffic to both physical and digital channels. Continuing to pursue strategic partnerships and exclusive collaborations can further solidify Target's position as a discovery destination for consumers."", ""Intense Competition and Market Saturation: The retail industry is highly competitive, with players ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce giants. Target must continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to stay ahead of competitors who are also vying for market share. Additionally, the market saturation of retail outlets in certain regions can limit Target's growth potential and put pressure on pricing and margins."", ""Regulatory and Cybersecurity Risks: Target operates in a complex regulatory environment that is subject to changes in data protection laws, trade policies, and labor regulations. Compliance with these evolving requirements can incur significant costs and necessitate changes in business practices. Moreover, cybersecurity threats pose a constant risk to the company's operations and reputation. Ensuring robust data security measures and maintaining customer trust in the face of potential breaches is critical for Target's sustained success."", ""In conclusion, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) exhibits a strong market presence and brand equity, underpinned by an efficient supply chain and a commitment to innovation.

If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.', 'The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.', ""According to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\xa0"", 'Meanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.', 'In this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

As a direct result of its huge stock price increase, the cost of one Nvidia share is nearing $1,000. This threshold may seem arbitrary, but it's actually an important milestone with a special place in the stock market's mass psychology. Therefore, management teams often consider splitting their stocks around this nice, round number. Furthermore, Nvidia's management team has a history of enacting stock splits."", 'Is Nvidia preparing for another split?', ""Stock splits can have both real and artificial effects. On the artificial side, you're essentially cutting the same-sized pizza into smaller slices. Investors with access to brokerages that offer fractional shares can already cut Nvidia's stock into pieces as small as they want (usually down to one-thousandth of a share)."", ""However, not every investor (especially those outside the U.S.) has access to this capability. In that sense, Nvidia's potential stock split becomes a real factor since more investors can purchase the stock without fear of overweighting their portfolio to one company. If you only have $100 to invest this month, a stock changing hands at $1,000 per share feels out of reach (even if fractional shares are available in your favorite stock brokerage)."", ""But will Nvidia do it? The company's history of stock splits suggests that another one could be imminent."", 'Nvidia has split its stock five times since it went on the market.

Stock splits were far more common back then, so the instances before the 2021 split may be less useful for forecasting purposes in 2024.', ""Now that the stock price is above 2021 pre-split levels again, I'd say Nvidia is highly likely to enact a stock split."", 'After Nvidia announced its stock split on May 21, 2021, the stock had a strong run-up until the split took effect on July 20, increasing nearly 40% at its peak.', ""This same time frame would also make sense in 2024, as Nvidia's annual meeting occurs in June. So if you're looking for a stock split announcement, stay tuned to Nvidia's Q1 FY 2025 results, which will be reported sometime in late May."", 'Is right now a good time to buy the stock in anticipation of a run-up due to buying frenzies caused by a stock split? I\'d say no. The only good reason to buy a stock is if the underlying business is worth owning. In Nvidia\'s case, the answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes,"" as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in high demand due to interest in artificial intelligence (AI) computing.', 'Nvidia has continuously posted amazing revenue growth figures. Its latest results (Q4 FY 2024, ending Jan. 28) included a revenue rise of 265% to $22.1 billion and a projection for another 234% rise to $24 billion in Q1 FY 2025.)', ""That sounds like a great business. If the company continues to post results like that, management will likely enact a stock split.

It minimizes generator run time by storing energy in batteries and running on battery power whenever possible.

This allows a contractor to significantly downsize the generator and dramatically reduce generator run time and emissions, while still meeting peak power demands.', '""Battery energy systems for tower cranes provide a great application of practical sustainability on the jobsite by helping contractors address their economic and environmental goals,"" said Larry Worthington, Region Vice President, Power and HVAC, United Rentals.

Generator run time was reduced by 91%, which resulted in a fuel and emissions reduction of approximately 80%.', '""Sustainable building aligns with our company’s core values. We are proud our Riverbank Landing construction site is making history as one of the first in Canada to fully power its site tower crane entirely by battery,"" said Brian Hennessey, Construction Manager, Award Construction.', 'This innovative tower crane battery energy system is part of a range of low and zero-emission solutions.

If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.', 'The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.', ""According to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\xa0"", 'Meanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.', 'In this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McDonald's, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.6% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.8% by the third-largest shareholder."", 'On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance.

Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', ""Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$261m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies."", ""It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

271,94e2ce91-683f-3ab8-9a75-3f237f962546,MCD,2024-03-14,McDonald’s Stock (NYSE:MCD): Investors Are Lovin’ It!,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-stock-nyse-mcd-investors-060815348.html,1710396495,STORY,['MCD'],"['McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) iconic “I’m Lovin’ It” slogan resonates not only with customers but also with shareholders, who keep driving the stock higher. The fast-food giant continues to rapidly increase its revenues and earnings with no indication of slowing down. Its affordable offerings mix keeps pushing higher sales in existing locations, while aggressive new restaurant openings, including CosMc’s, a new beverage-led concept, promise sustained growth momentum. Accordingly, I remain bullish on MCD.', 'Seeing McDonald’s keep delivering double-digit revenue growth with no signs of slowing down is absolutely remarkable. You would assume that many of the company’s locations should have already maximized their sales potential, as they have been in business for years.', 'However, by deploying smart sales tactics, such as incentivizing loyalty program participation and rolling out the annual Monopoly promotion, McDonald’s has been able to drive growing spending per store. The push of digital ordering for faster service and, crucially, maintaining competitive prices in an inflationary environment has also contributed to continuous growth in same-store sales.', 'In Canada, for example, McDonald’s maintained its iconic McMuffin and hot coffee bundle throughout Q4, offering a compelling bundle during the crucial morning hours. This led to notable gains in breakfast market share. McDonald’s also incentivized in-app orders and promoted the advantages of the “Ready on Arrival” offering, resulting in a 60-second reduction in wait times for curbside pickups nationwide.', 'The result of these initiatives, and again, importantly, McDonald’s menu mix remaining quite affordable against other eating-out options, drove same-store sales growth of 9% in Fiscal 2023. Combined with McDonald’s achieving 1,547 net restaurant openings during the year, pushing its total location count to 41,822, total revenues for the year rose by 10% to $25.5 billion.', 'The brilliance of McDonald’s business model lies in its ability to grow profits at a greater pace than its sales due to its royalty-based structure. With a whopping 95% of its locations operating under franchise agreements, the company makes its money mainly from royalties and the rent its franchises pay for on its properties.', 'As same-store sales climb, McDonald’s effortlessly collects higher royalties without bearing additional expenses. Because of this, the company inherently enjoys expanding profit margins over time, helping its bottom-line growth outpace its revenue growth. Indeed, in FY2023, McDonald’s operating profit margin reached a record 45.9%, up from 44.6% last year, resulting in the company’s net income surging by 37% to $8.47 billion. Buybacks further boosted EPS, which grew by 39% to a record $11.56.', 'McDonald’s growth catalysts remain robust, in my view, which should translate to robust revenue growth and, as explained, even more significant earnings growth. Specifically, the company expects to continue expanding its global footprint and to reach 50,000 restaurants by 2027. This implies an acceleration to the current pace of openings.', 'Further, McDonald’s has identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across its top six markets: beverage-led experiences, where its core business typically underindexes. In a little less than a year, when this opportunity was identified, McDonald’s opened a pilot CosMc’s restaurant, attracting significant buzz.', 'This single location is now based in Bolingbrook, IL, and management plans to run a 10-store test. Any contribution to revenues will be minimal in the beginning, of course. However, McDonald’s now has the opportunity to slowly build a new brand in the beverage space, which could eventually grow into a big franchise with thousands of locations. This initiative alone could make for a significant long-term sales growth tailwind on top of McDonald’s core brand.', 'Therefore, despite McDonald’s prolonged share price rally, I believe that its bullish momentum could be very well maintained. In the meantime, the stock’s forward P/E of 22.7 appears well-justified, considering the company’s underlying earnings growth and future growth catalysts.', 'Looking at Wall Street’s view on the stock, McDonald’s features a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on 18 Buys and eight Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. At $323.24, the average\xa0MCD stock forecast\xa0suggests 14.3% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MCD stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0David Palmer\xa0from Evercore ISI, with an average return of 16.14% per rating and a 98% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'In conclusion, McDonald’s continues to demonstrate impressive, double-digit revenue increases while posting record operating margins and earnings. With initiatives like digital ordering, menu bundling, and maintaining affordable prices, the company has been able to keep driving growing traffic in its stores and even capture market share in some categories.', 'Management’s plan to reach 50,000 locations by 2027, as well as the potential of CosMc’s growing into a big franchise opportunity for McDonald’s, should keep boosting its financials. Thus, I can see the stock’s ongoing bullish momentum lasting, especially given that its valuation remains at rather reasonable levels.', 'Disclosure']"

Which is interesting as you look at it alongside the Dollar Tree news."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, of course, we have that CPI report out yesterday. And we continue to see the cost of restaurants not decelerate as much as the cost of groceries. The cost of groceries has come down significantly, or rather the rise in the cost of groceries has decelerated much more so than the cost to dine out. And so consumers are being much more aware of just how much they're spending when they go out, being more frugal about how far they can spend their dollar, whether it be at grocery or dining out."", ""And McDonald's CFO really saying here that they are losing that lower income consumer, not to another chain, but to the grocery store. And I think this will definitely be one to watch how value and affordability plays into this. How all these fast food giants are really looking to get in front of consumers, and say we have the best bundle, we'll give you the best bang for your buck here."", '- Now, you also talked a little bit about international sales as well.

Instead, the ideas usually center around giant consumer goods companies, banks or utility firms – you know, institutions that are hardly exciting but command everyday relevance.', 'Still, it’s time to show some love to dividend tech stocks. Admittedly, with the furor regarding artificial intelligence and the blockchain these days, it’s easy to think that publicly traded innovators are all about capital gains. And that’s true for the usual suspects. However, dig around and you’ll find some compelling tech firms that pay you will you sleep.', 'Now, let me be 100% clear: I’m not suggesting you abandon the capital gains approach. After all, I’m a cryptocurrency investor. Saying that would be hypocritical. What I am saying is that don’t ignore the below dividend tech stocks. They’re mature enterprises but they certainly have their charm.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most valuable enterprises in the world due to its importance for the global computer chip supply chain. However, TSM may be getting a bit long in the tooth regarding its growth narrative. Analysts project shares to hit $138.83 on average, which is a very modest target.', 'Still, I appreciate TSM as one of the credible dividend tech stocks. First, Wall Street experts predict that 2024 sales will land at $84.76 billion, representing 22.1% growth on the top line. On the bottom line, they anticipate earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be $5.75. That’s a sizable gain from the $5.19 posted last year.', 'Again, that translates to a credible pathway for consistent passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward dividend yield of 1.65%. Granted, that’s only modestly higher from the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. However, the payout ratio sits at 29.71%, providing support for yield sustainability.

Their average price target lands at $162.80, which at this moment means nothing. Granted, the high-side target is $180 but the reality is that QCOM may attract more as one of the dividend tech stocks rather than a capital gains play. That’s not a bad gig.', 'Analysts see 2024 sales landing at $38.09 billion. That represents a 6.3% lift from the $35.83 billion in sales printed last year. On the bottom line, Wall Street experts believe that Qualcomm could generate EPS of $9.73. Last year, this tally came out to $8.43.', 'Currently, the tech giant offers a forward yield of 1.98%.

Per TipRanks, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $104.17 average price target. Also, the high-side target runs up to $115. Those are solid estimates.', 'On the financials, experts believe that company sales could hit $5.04 billion, representing a 3% gain from last year. Also, they anticipate EPS to land at $6.50, contrasting nicely with EPS of $5.91 in 2023.', 'In terms of passive income, Amdocs offers a forward dividend yield of 2.11%.

That would come out to a 32.2% sales increase from last year.', 'In terms of profitability, analysts project EPS to land at $4.61 by year’s end.

By the end of the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate that revenue will land at $6.5 billion. If so, that would lead to a $12 decline against last year’s tally of $7.38 billion. That’s not great. However, by 2025, they project sales to hit $8.66 billion. Moreover, the high-side estimate calls for sales of $9.75 billion.', 'Notably, though, EPS in 2024 should ping at 73 cents, well above last year’s 19-cent print.

It also trades at 1.17X tangible book value. That’s lower than nearly 83% of its peers.', 'Admittedly, analysts have some questions about 2024’s revenue performance, which may explain some of the disappointing price action. By the end of this year, experts believe that Himax will only print sales of $901.25 million. That would fall short of last year’s tally of $945.45 million by 4.7%. However, the good news is that they also believe revenue will land just above $982 million by 2025.', 'On the bottom line, analysts project 2024 EPS to be 35 cents, above last year’s 29-cent performance.

Cross-border payments represent a lucrative sector due to its high-margin nature, with companies often able to levy additional foreign exchange fees. Steady growth in travel and entertainment-related spending is also bolstering the global tourism and hospitality industries, pivotal in the economic resurgence of numerous nations. Extensive research conducted by leading payments companies shows that travel growth is expected to continue on its course.', 'Last November, Visa Inc. V unveiled findings from its 2023 Visa Global Travel Intentions Study, revealing a sustained upsurge in travel activity following the pandemic despite inflationary pressures. The phenomenon of ""revenge travel"" emerged prominently as individuals sought to compensate for missed vacations and experiences, driving up cross-border payments for financial services providers.', 'In its 2024 Global Travel Trends Report, American Express Company AXP, an integrated payments firm, recently disclosed that 84% of survey respondents intend to maintain or increase their travel expenditure in 2024 compared to the previous year. Notably, 77% of participants prioritize the quality of their travel experience over the cost of the trip.', ""Travelers are increasingly prioritizing unique experiences, such as attending sporting events or embarking on adventurous expeditions. Additionally, there's a growing trend toward solo travel and spontaneous trips, reflecting a desire for personalized and flexible travel experiences. To achieve a better travel experience with ease of planning and personalized itinerary, people intend to use a travel agent or trusted advisor to help them book their trips."", 'The increasing demand for premium travel experiences is driving companies in the Financial Transaction Services industry to introduce innovative products tailored to meet these preferences. Firms boasting extensive global networks are poised to leverage this trend more effectively, capitalizing on the growing market for high-quality travel services.', 'Now let’s talk latest numbers.', 'On a constant-dollar basis, in the December 2023 quarter, the cross-border volume of Visa climbed 16% year over year. International transaction revenues amounted to more than $3 billion, which improved 8% year over year on the back of the growing volumes.', 'Similarly, American Express’ Global Merchant and Network Services segment’s total revenues (net of interest expense) jumped 10% year over year to $1.94 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s U.S. Consumer Services segment, which extends travel and lifestyle services among several other products to consumers, witnessed 13% year-over-year growth in total revenues (net of interest expense) to $7.4 billion, thanks to higher Card Member spending. You can see\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'Another transaction processing and payments services giant, Mastercard Incorporated MA, witnessed cross-border volumes advancing 18% year over year in the fourth quarter on a local currency basis.

The travel industry's resurgence will continue driving significant growth in transaction volumes and revenues for these companies. So far, the high inflation in most of the economies failed to disrupt the travel growth trend. Many governments opting for rate hikes to tame inflation has worked to some extent, providing a respite to consumers. This is also expected to influence travel and entertainment related spending. However, growing geopolitical uncertainties in different regions may impact travel decisions, requiring payment firms to adapt accordingly."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

', 'As the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.', ""February 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates."", ""Yet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn."", ""On this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes."", 'A higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:', 'This constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now.

Undoubtedly, AI technology stands to benefit more than just the “Magnificent Seven” stocks. In 2024, we could see the AI wave lift the other boats navigating the rough tech seas. Therefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to analyze three tech stocks (DELL, CDNS, and INTU) that could turn AI innovation into meaningful share price drivers over the next year.', 'Analysts view each stock quite favorably at this juncture, even after their scorching-hot past-year performances.', 'Dell knocked one out of the park when it reported its latest quarterly result, sending shares surging around 30% in a day. High demand for AI servers was a significant reason why Dell was able to pole-vault over expectations on the bottom line. Combined with a 20% dividend hike and upbeat (and AI-heavy) guidance for its Fiscal Year 2025, it seems like many investors are just starting to discover the AI potential to be had in the firm.', 'I’ll admit that DELL stock was one of the names I scratched off my tech watchlist in favor of some of the bigger and more prominent players in the AI scene. Although shares of DELL have more than tripled over the past year (up 210%), they still don’t look all too expensive at 25.0 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) or 15.6 times forward P/E, especially given the magnitude of its AI tailwinds. For these reasons, I’m inclined to stay bullish on DELL, just like the analyst community.', 'As exciting and emerging terms like edge AI, AI PCs, and neural processing units (NPUs) look to take off in 2024, Dell Technologies stock could be one of the companies next in line to capture the heart of upside-seeking investors. With its AI-capable Precision 3000 and 5000 workstations, Dell stands out as one of the major potential beneficiaries as AI begins to move from the cloud toward the edge.', 'Dell stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average DELL stock price target\xa0of $115.77 implies 5.3% upside potential.', 'Cadence Design Systems is a far pricier play than Dell, with shares currently trading at 81.5 times trailing P/E. On the price-to-sales (P/S) front, shares look even pricier at a whopping 20.4 times P/S. Indeed, CDNS stock goes for a massive premium to the application software industry average. But Cadence is a leading intelligence system design play that’s really in a league of its own.', 'The company’s Millenium M1 AI supercomputer system could change engineering design and complex simulations as we know them. Given how profound the AI-powered technology is, I’d argue that CDNS stock deserves every bit of its seemingly lofty multiple. As Cadence takes the AI ball and runs with it, I find it to be hard to be anything but bullish as the firm looks to bounce back from a rare quarter of subtle softness.', 'Last month, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stepped up to remark on Cadence’s long-term strategy, which, it believes, is worth getting behind following the company’s latest first-quarter fumble. Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson sees “momentum in chip design” continuing “into next year at least.” The bank also raised CDNS stock’s price target to a Street-high $350, up from $260.', 'CDNS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average CDNS stock price target\xa0of $321.70 implies 5.1% upside potential.', 'Intuit stock has been coming back in a big way over the past year and change, now up over 83% from its late-2022 lows. As tax season rolls around, the top tax-prep software firm is bound to grab more attention. However, it’s the firm’s small business and self-employed offerings that stand to be the star of the show as new innovations in the field of AI are thrown into the mix.', 'As Intuit invests in AI, its economic moat will grow even wider, and its valuation multiple could continue swelling. As shares flirt with new all-time highs, I continue to be bullish on the name.', 'The company’s latest quarter was pretty good, with sales rising 11.3% year-over-year to $3.39 billion. QuickBooks helped Intuit power the beat, while Credit Karma was a slight drag. Moving ahead, I’d look for Intuit Assist, which is pretty much like an AI copilot for the company’s software suite, to really move the needle higher over the coming year.', 'Combined with Intuit’s generative AI operating system (GenOS), it’s clear that Intuit’s ecosystem only stands to get more powerful from here. I’m pretty convinced Intuit is an AI stock disguised as a financial software company as the firm looks to achieve its goal of evolving into an “AI-driven expert platform.”', 'Cadence stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 20 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average INTU stock price target\xa0of $705.62 implies 7.7% upside potential.', 'Look for 2024 to show us that more than just mega-cap tech stars stand to gain from the AI revolution. The following trio stand out as firms that can use AI to extend their advantages in their respective markets of interest. Of the trio, I’m most pumped about Dell. It has a modest multiple and a robust position in AI PCs. Currently, though, analysts see the most upside from INTU stock.', 'Disclosure']"

Today, with data and artificial intelligence, Intuit wants customers to trust Intuit to handle more of the process for them."", ""“We're in the middle of that,” says Balazs. “And so obviously, there's a lot to do from a tech perspective, a capability perspective, and data and AI perspective.” Those newer tools include Intuit Assist, a generative AI-powered financial assistant."", 'Balazs says he was an introverted child but also saw the potential to be a great leader, inspired by his chemist father who rose up through the ranks at wastewater treatment plants. At the age of 12, his parents signed him up for a programming class at the local YMCA. It was 1983, the same year Scott Cook founded Intuit. Balazs was an athlete who competed in sports like football and basketball but equally enjoyed learning how to source code from physical magazines in his parents’ basement in Ohio.', ""Balazs joined Intuit in the fall of 1999 as a senior software engineer and was one of the first engineers to help put the desktop-bound QuickBooks onto the internet. At the time, Balazs explains, Intuit “wasn’t really a technology company. People knew the products, they didn't really know the tech behind it.”"", 'Throughout his earliest years at Intuit, Balazs considered himself a “boundaryless” leader, preferring to exert influence through his competence as an engineer. He was jolted after Intuit acquired Boston Light Software and founder Paul English left with many of Intuit’s leadership team to start travel search company Kayak. The experience left Balazs feeling abandoned and even angry.', 'That was when Balazs began to step outside his comfort zone and when the leadership qualities within him began to emerge more evidently. He was later selected to join Intuit’s leadership training program and learned the ropes from his predecessor Marianna Tessel and another former Intuit CTO, Tayloe Stansbury.', 'When he became CTO of Intuit, which generated $14.4 billion in total revenue for the latest fiscal year, Balazs got some friendly advice from CEO Sasan Goodarzi, who he recalls told him: “Alex, the best thing about you in this role is you\'ve been here for 24 years. The worst thing about you in this role is you\'ve been here for 24 years. You need to act like it\'s Day One.""', 'As a leader, Balazs keeps his experiences as a frontline engineer top of mind, and, in fact, he still has running code in production. “I will make a bigger impact by the environment that I create, by the culture that I create,” he says.', ""Please continue to reach out and share new executive appointment news (CIO, CTO, CDO) and any graphics and stats that would be helpful to share with other IT leaders.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Electric's  ROE today."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:', '32% = US$9.0b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.32 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""Firstly, we acknowledge that General Electric has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 28%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 55% net income growth seen by General Electric was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE."", ""As a next step, we compared General Electric's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 41%."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GE? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. "", ""General Electric's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 3.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (97%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number."", ""Besides, General Electric has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 5.1% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 22%) over the same period."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with General Electric's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

', ""The close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records."", 'Another change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).

During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.', ""This wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:"", ""Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend.

Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release.

The healthcare industry has been facing a formidable challenge following the incident.', 'The attack on UnitedHealth brought a critical component of the healthcare payment processing infrastructure to a halt, affecting the flow of billions of dollars for healthcare providers, insurers and pharmacies. This paralysis has plunged numerous clinics into financial distress, with some facing the grim prospect of turning patients away or securing loans to continue operations.', 'Shares of UNH have lost 7.3% year to date compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline. The S&P 500 gained 8% in the same time frame.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The impact of the cyberattack has been particularly severe on smaller healthcare providers, including those offering vital services like chemotherapy. These practices rely on a steady flow of insurance payments to fund their operations and purchase necessary drugs.', ""The disruption has forced them to seek extended payment terms from pharmaceutical wholesalers or delay payments altogether, indicating the attack's extensive reach beyond immediate victims to broader segments of the $4.5-trillion U.S. healthcare industry. For instance, the Pontchartrain Cancer Center reported a drastic reduction to 40% of its typical payments, highlighting the severe financial crisis of these clinics."", 'In response to the crisis, UnitedHealth has been collaborating with U.S. health authorities and working on restoring its affected services. The company has made progress in resuming pharmacy services and is testing its medical claims network, aiming to alleviate the backlog of payments. However, the full recovery timeline remains uncertain, underscoring the challenges in overcoming such a substantial disruption.', 'The Biden administration has also stepped in, urging UnitedHealth and other insurers to provide emergency funding to affected healthcare providers. Efforts include easing regulations that may prevent patients from receiving care and allowing cash-strapped providers to seek advance payments from Medicare. Additionally, UnitedHealth has introduced programs to offer financial support to providers, acting on a case-by-case basis.', 'Recognizing the urgent need, drug distributors like Cencora COR and McKesson MCK, traditionally rigid in their payment terms, began to adapt their practices, offering lifelines to these vulnerable providers.', 'Cencora, for instance, responded to the crisis by extending payment deadlines and allowing providers to order more drugs than usual, albeit the extension was less than some had hoped for. Similarly, McKesson showed flexibility, adjusting its payment demands in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances facing healthcare providers. This adaptability from national distributors like Cencora and McKesson was critical in ensuring that clinics could continue to purchase necessary medications, thereby maintaining patient care during times of financial instability.', 'Furthermore, the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb also stepped in, offering temporary adjustments in payment terms for crucial cancer and blood disorder medications. These concerted efforts by drug distributors and pharmaceutical companies highlight a collective response to an unprecedented challenge, underscoring the importance of collaboration and support within the healthcare ecosystem to sustain patient care in times of crisis.', 'This cyberattack underscores the vulnerability of critical infrastructure within the healthcare sector to digital threats. It highlights the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures and the identification of potential single points of failure within the healthcare system.

However, this notion isn't entirely accurate. According to findings from Jensen Investment Management, high-quality mid-cap companies have shown resilience over the past decade, often keeping pace with or even outperforming the broader S&P 500 index. For instance, while quality mid-caps experienced a 10.6% decline in 2022, the S&P 500 suffered a greater loss of 18.1%. The report also mentioned that across various timeframes spanning three, five, and ten years ending in 2022, the performance outcomes have displayed mixed results. Quality mid-cap stocks consistently demonstrated comparable performance, delivering positive returns of 7.8%, 9.6%, and 12.2%, respectively.

Since its inception in 2015, this index has consistently outpaced the broader S&P MidCap 400, achieving an annualized outperformance of 177 basis points while exhibiting lower levels of volatility. These mid-cap Dividend Aristocrats have demonstrated resilience in navigating market fluctuations over time. They have managed to capture most of the market's upswings during bull markets while significantly mitigating losses during bear markets, which proves to be a valuable characteristic, especially in times of uncertainty. The report further mentioned that mid-cap dividend growers experienced distribution growth at an annualized rate surpassing 12% since 2015. This growth rate exceeded that of large-cap companies and recent inflation levels."", 'One general misperception of mid-cap stocks is that these companies reinvest a significant portion of their earnings to fund expansion, research and development, and other growth initiatives. However, according to analysts, investors might be missing out on some opportunities by doing so. Especially when these companies offer dividends, investors are advised to take a leap of faith and invest in small- and mid-cap (SMID) dividend payers. Sarah Radecki, CFA, equity portfolio manager at Principal Asset Management, spoke with the Wall Street Journal about the investment potential these companies offer. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“SMID dividend stocks provide an attractive tradeoff between risk and return, with the potential for relatively high total return, low volatility, and predictable growth of income. You may be able to secure an income stream from a smaller stock with the potential to grow over time, without paying sky-high prices.”', 'The Wall Street Journal report highlighted the strong performance shown by SMID dividend companies. These dividend stocks have delivered an annual return of 15.68% from 1975 to June 2023, surpassing both large-cap dividend-paying stocks and the overall stock market. Additionally, their volatility is approximately 15% lower than the average SMID stock. Moreover, these differences become even more significant among SMID stocks that consistently increase their dividend payouts. Over the last 35 years, these dividend-growing stocks have achieved more attractive annualized gains while exhibiting lower risk compared to the average SMID dividend payer.', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.', ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group ', ""In business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It's an outstanding feat for American Airlines Group to have grown EPS from US$0.20 to US$1.26 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that American Airlines Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The music to the ears of American Airlines Group shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 4.6% to 7.7% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts."", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for American Airlines Group's future EPS 100% free."", ""Since American Airlines Group has a market capitalisation of US$9.1b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$160m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!"", ""While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations between US$4.0b and US$12b, like American Airlines Group, the median CEO pay is around US$7.7m."", 'The American Airlines Group CEO received US$4.9m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.', ""American Airlines Group's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. American Airlines Group is certainly doing some things right and is well worth investigating. It is worth noting though that we have found 3 warning signs for American Airlines Group (2 are potentially serious!) that you need to take into consideration."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

This was echoed by airline heavyweights at the JPMorgan investor event. As a result of the crisis engulfing the plane manufacturer, airlines are being forced to cut their flight schedules. To this end, Southwest Airlines’ LUV management stated that it was advised by Boeing to expect 46 737-8 jets in 2024 compared with the earlier stated 79 737 MAX jets, which included 58 MAX 8 planes.Delta Air Lines DAL does not expect the Boeing 737 Max 10 planes to be delivered before 2027. Previously, DAL anticipated the planes to get delivered from 2025 onward. American Airlines AAL increased its fuel cost per gallon projection for first-quarter 2024. Copa Holdings’ CPA February traffic report was impressive, driven by an upbeat air-travel demand.Read the last Airline Roundup here.', '1. Southwest Airlines’ management expects first-quarter 2024 available seat miles to improve 11% from the year-ago reported figure (the previous anticipation was for a 10% increase). Economic fuel costs per gallon are likely to be $2.95-$3 (earlier expectation was $2.7-$2.8). LUV expects cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 6% in the first quarter from the comparable period in 2023. Interest expenses are anticipated to be $65 million in the first quarter. LUV expects first-quarter 2024 revenue per available seat mile or RASM to be either flat or increase up to 2%. The earlier expectation was for a 2.5-4.5% increase. The reduced expectation is primarily due to higher-than-expected completion factors in February and March. Lower-than-expected close-in leisure passenger volume is also likely to hurt RASM. The company expects to incur a net loss in first-quarter 2024.', ""The delay in the delivery of 737 MAX jets by Boeing is prompting Southwest Airlines to re-evaluate all prior 2024 guidance, including the expectation on capex. As a result of the issues at Boeing, LUV expects the delivery schedule to be fluid and, therefore, intends to reduce capacity and re-optimize schedules, primarily for the back half of 2024, which will likely result in at least a one-point reduction in LUV’s 2024 capacity plans. While releasing its fourth-quarter 2023 results, the company’s management stated that 2024 capacity would improve 6% from the 2023 reported level.2. Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) increased 17.5% on a year-over-year basis at Copa Holdings in February. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In February, available seat miles increased 17% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.3% from 85.9% in February 2023. Currently, CPA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. Delta, which currently does not have any Boeing 737 MAX jet in its fleet, stuck to most of its first-quarter and 2024 outlook that it had provided while releasing the fourth-quarter 2023 results. Management now anticipates first-quarter 2024 total revenues (adjusted) to be in the top half of the year-over-year increase of 3-6% mentioned previously. First-quarter 2024 earnings are expected to be 25-50 cents per share. The adjusted operating margin in the March quarter is anticipated to be 5%. Adjusted earnings for 2024 are predicted to be $6-$7 per share.4. American Airlines’ management expects fuel cost per gallon of $2.8-$2.9 for first-quarter 2024 (earlier projection was at $2.65-$2.85). AAL projects the March-end quarter's loss per share (excluding net special items) to be in the lower end of the 15-35 cents mentioned previously. First-quarter available seat miles are expected to increase 6.5-8.5%. Total revenue per available seat mile is expected to increase 3.5-5.5% in first-quarter 2024 from the first-quarter 2023 actuals.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, American Airlines is expected to post a loss of $0.24 per share, indicating a change of -580% from the year-ago quarter.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'Aflac in Focus', ""Aflac (AFL) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 0.53% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.41%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.5% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.58%."", ""Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2 is up 19% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.68%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Aflac's payout ratio is 27%, which means it paid out 27% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.41 per share, with earnings expected to increase 2.89% from the year ago period.', 'Bottom Line', 'From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.', 'High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) reported a revenue of $5.91 billion, surpassing estimates by $41.80 million. Here are some of the comments from the Q4 2023 earnings call:', ""“Our first quarter was really a sound quarter and outstanding in several respects in terms of our operations. It was really led by PT-FI during the whole year of 2023. We began our ramp up in 2019 of the underground and now we are fully operationally, and the team has been setting records consistently out there and have just outperformed for the full year and faced some really challenges, which is just part of that business. But I'm very proud of our PT-FI team at job site in Jakarta. We are making great progress and fulfilling our 2018 commitment to the government to invest in downstreaming and the copper concentrate business. In December, I was there for the inauguration of the expansion of the older smelter, PT Smelting with President Joko Widodo and that was a good event."", ""And then with our new smelter at Manyar in Eastern Java, we reached an important 90% milestone at the end of the year and we're progressing for physical completion of the smelter and ramping it up on schedule in 2024. A couple of words about the markets. It continues to be the micro versus macro story. Notably, in 2023, the macro factors strengthened notably. 2023 had long been forecasted to be a year of surplus because of new mines coming on stream, but it ended up being a small deficit. And at the same time, there was stronger than expected demand for copper in the United States and in China despite all the issues with China's property business other sectors created a notable growth for copper in China.”"", 'With this context, let’s take a look at the top 20 mineral importing countries in the world.\xa0\xa0', 'Top 20 Mineral Importing Countries in the World', 'Our Methodology', 'To compile the list of the top 20 mineral importing countries in the world, we gathered data from OEC World.

Morgan 2024 Industrials Conference could easily be seen as a rebuttal to one man: Amit Bose, the chairman of the Federal Railroad Administration.', 'Bose wrote a letter to the Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) CEO Feb. 29, responding to reports of extensive furloughs at the Class 1 railroad that serves the Western half of the U.S. “The [FRA] has previously communicated our concerns to UP regarding the potential risks of reducing staffing levels in critical departments such as mechanical operations,” Bose wrote. “Despite FRA’s warnings and recommendations, and at a time when Class I freights should be prioritizing ways to improve a decade-long record of stagnant safety performance, it is disappointing to see that UP is actively disregarding the federal government’s concerns.”', 'Vena shot back a day later, saying Bose’s letter made an “inaccurate correlation between natural workforce fluctuations and safety.” “Your letter … combines different types of workers and paints an incorrect and incomplete picture of the natural role workforce fluctuations play in operating a railroad year-round,” Vena wrote.', 'Given that the back-and-forth took place less than three weeks ago, it wasn’t hard to hear in Vena’s presentation a public response to Bose’s safety concerns without mentioning Bose by name.', 'The opening slide Vena showed at the J.P. Morgan conference cited statistics about UP’s recent safety record: no work-related deaths in 2023, a 15% year-over-year reduction in serious injuries, a 28% drop in derailments in the past 10 years and a 26% improvement in derailments since precision railroading — the efficiency-driven management system that has been blamed by critics for a variety of railroad ills — was implemented in 2019.', '“Union Pacific as well as the entire industry has made significant progress over the years,” Vena told conference attendees. The railroad ended 2023 “with good momentum,” he said, citing last year’s zero deaths.', '“But we understand we still have work to do, especially to reach our goal of industry leadership,” Vena added.', 'He cited an initiative at UP to identify the primary causes of injuries, saying the company had found six key “choices that individuals make each day” that cause an outsize percentage of injuries. He did not name the six but said they are called “Go Home Safe” choices within the railroad, “and we rolled out new policies and training to all employees to prevent these potentially life-threatening behaviors.”', '“The key message is that the right priority has been placed on the safety of our network,” Vena said.', 'Bose’s criticism was not the first directed at Vena by a federal official. In November, at the RailTrends conference in New York, Surface Transportation Board Chairman Martin Oberman also criticized Vena by alleging he was favoring shareholder returns over safety.', 'Observers of the rail system in the U.S. recently have been noting improvements in service and incremental gains in market share after years of standing still and hearing endless criticism of performance.', 'Vena said in response to questions from Brian Ossenbeck, a senior analyst at J.P. Morgan and the investment bank’s lead transportation analyst, that internal performance metrics at Union Pacific had largely ignored customer satisfaction. The previous metric measured “success against our trip plan that we had built,” Vena said during his roughly half-hour presentation.', '“The standard was driven by what we needed to do,” he said, but it could never get to 100% satisfaction because “it wasn’t reflective of what the customer wanted.” It also could easily be manipulated, he said, noting that the number of hours needed to get a train out of the yard and on to the Union Pacific system could just be extended in the plan, making compliance easier.', 'The old system has been replaced by the Service Performance Index (SPI). In a letter to customers last month, Kenny Rocker, the company’s executive vice president for marketing and sales, spelled out the measurements built into SPI.', 'For manifest and intermodal service, Rocker said the comparison will be between the service a customer is receiving now and “the best monthly network performance over the last three years.”', 'For a unit train hauling one type of good or a lineup of an identical type of cars, the measurement will be on a monthly basis to determine how well those trains are “achieving their demand and cycle times on a monthly basis.”', '“What SPI is, it measured what we’ve sold our customers,” Vena said at the conference. The measurement is at a “high level,” he said, and it ultimately is “a consolidation of everything, but in fact we have specific measures and specific [key performance indicators.]”', 'Vena did not specifically address the furloughs that Bose referred to in his letter. But he did talk about the company’s current workforce, as did CFO Jennifer Hamann, who also addressed the conference.', 'Union Pacific is in the midst of implementing the terms of the landmark agreement it made with its engineers last year, which provided for a schedule of 11 days on call and four days off.', 'Hamann said as the implementation proceeds, “right now you’re seeing us carry a few extra employees.” Along with healthy volumes on the railroad, “we want to maintain a buffer,” she said. “We want to be ready to serve our customers and provide them the service they need, and we’ve got to have a little bit of slack in the system to deal with that.”', 'Vena said that slack extends to locomotives. About 500 Union Pacific locomotives are “ready to go” if there were demand for more service, while access to an additional 1,000 would take “a little bit of work” to secure. “We have as many units parked that some of the other smaller Class 1s have operating,” Vena said. “We don’t have an asset problem. Our infrastructure is in place to be able to move and increase business if we have to.”', 'While an uptick in service might require some investment in capital, “overall the railroad was built to handle more traffic than we have today,” Vena said.', 'Recent performance numbers do speak to a railroad serving more customers. The company’s fourth-quarter earnings release reported that quarterly volume was up 3.5% from the fourth quarter of 2022, and the operating ratio improved to 60.9% from 61%.', 'For the full year, OR improved to 60.1% from 62.3% for all of 2022. Volume was up anywhere from 3% to 4% for the full year, depending on product category.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'Norfolk Southern fires back at Ancora, gets Wall Street analyst’s support', 'Settlement of case involving BNSF’s use of trucker biometrics set at $75 million', 'If truckers haul bread and cakes, is their business baking or trucking?', 'The post Union Pacific CEO defends safety practices without mentioning key critic appeared first on FreightWaves.']"
