Pinpointing individual factors influencing the banking industry would take all day. Still, the broad strokes include high borrowing rates, inflation, increased competition, commercial real estate concerns and growing regulatory demands. These and other forces converged to kick off the brief, thus far, 2023 Banking Crisis. During the March meltdown, the Morningstar Banking Index, comprised of publicly traded US banks, fell nearly 20%. Since then, the index has outpaced market growth as it’s bounced back 20% compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 15% return over the same period. Still, banks have remained fairly flat since January returning only 0.63% year-to-date.Unsurprisingly, some stocks are suppressed within the devalued basket of stocks due to industry-wide pressure rather than company-specific problems. For investors bullish on banking, these cheap bank stocks are priced to buy, particularly on the heels of decent earnings reports.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsM&amp;T Bank Corp (MTB)A customer makes a transaction at a bankSource: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.comM&amp;T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) blew analyst estimates out of the water, reporting a $5.05 EPS. That’s nearly 20% more than the analyst consensus reported by MarketWatch. Somehow, shares remained relatively flat after the surprise beat. No doubt due to industry concerns rather than issues with M&amp;T’s outlook, making the stock decidedly undervalued. Notably, the firm reported a jump in net interest margin. Although elevated rates put downward pressure on banking services, M&amp;T can pass the higher cost to consumers to stay healthy. Value investors should combine M&amp;T’s adaptation ability with bargain bin fundamentals. Today, the firm’s price-to-book ratio is 0.96, indicating it’s priced below its assets’ worth. Combine this undervalue indicator with a nearly 5% stock price drop since the beginning of the year, and it’s clear that M&amp;T is an overlooked bank stock play today.Story continuesUS Bancorp (USB)usbank (USB) logo on a bank during nighttimeSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.comLike M&amp;T, US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) published a healthy quarterly earnings report and demonstrated adaption to higher interest rates. The company’s consumer-based services include mortgage banking and wealth management. These diverse revenue streams bode well for the company’s future. Moreover, the firm’s avoidance of investment banking means it avoids much of the exposure risk firms like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) embrace. US Bancorp’s regional focus, consumer emphasis and risk avoidance make it ideal for investors interested in banks with limited downside. Likewise, the company is forward-looking enough for tech enthusiasts as the firm continually adapts to changing digitization expectations. In March, the firm invested in Ownera, a startup firm “working to digitize paper-heavy and illiquid private markets, allowing banks, asset managers and exchanges to route assets more efficiently.” This investment is just one of many in US Bancorp’s fintech portfolio. A future-focused orientation helps ensure the company’s longevity as it entrenches itself in the future of finance. Investors should combine a 1.27 price-to-book ratio with an earnings beat, healthy profits from interest income and flexibility in future adaptations. These and other factors make US Bancorp a quality play in the world of cheap bank stocks.Comerica Incorporated (CMA)A sign for Comerica (CMA) bank in California.Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comComerica (NYSE:CMA) has a middle-market commercial lending focus which makes it an ideal play for the changing economic landscape. Middle-market lending represents $6.3 trillion worth of opportunity, and rising rates mean creditors like Comerica can be more discerning in their lending practices while charging a premium.Furthermore, the company’s core loan portfolio is largely made up of adjustable-rate options. This exposes the company to interest rate risk if the U.S. Federal Reserve slashes current levels, but this scenario isn’t likely. We’re still expecting two more rate hikes this year, and the forecast isn’t planning for a drop in the medium term. This means Comerica will keep pace with the Fed and reap greater interest income even as borrowing costs increase. Finally, Comerica has an unmatched 20.5% return on equity and a whopping 32% net margin. These stats are nearly unheard of in the broad banking sector, making Comerica one of the best bank stocks today. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

1,265f697b-4d94-3803-aba6-80998ddefcb3,CTAS,2023-07-30,Should You Think About Buying Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-cintas-corporation-nasdaq-110131248.html,1690714891,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Cintas’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Cintas What's The Opportunity In Cintas?The stock is currently trading at US$503 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 28% compared to my intrinsic value of $391.70. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Cintas’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Cintas?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Cintas' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CTAS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe CTAS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CTAS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CTAS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. While conducting our analysis, we found that Cintas has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you are no longer interested in Cintas, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis on educational attainment levels in these states, and head over directly to the 5 Least Educated States in America.A report by The Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 highlighted the direct relationship that exists between education levels and earnings. Their findings also show a correlation between education and less unemployment. Individuals whose education levels were less than a high school diploma, on average, earned $682 per week, compared to $1,005 for someone with a college or associate degree. Earnings continue to rise with the attainment of higher education – $1,432 per week for those holding a bachelor’s degree, followed by $1,661 for master’s, and over $2,000 per week for professional and doctoral degrees.West Virginia is the least educated state in America. According to The Census Bureau, 35.8% of the population aged between 18 and 24 are high school graduates, while 36% of them have a college or associate degree. On the other hand, only 14.2% of the population aged 25 and above have a bachelor’s degree, and just 9.9% hold a graduate or professional degree. In contrast, states like Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont are considered among the most educated states in the US due to a higher share of educational attainment across all levels of education.Many large corporations in the US are actively taking steps to provide easy access to education at a lower cost. There is great hope that technology and the internet can help provide quality education in a more cost effective manner. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does not just provide textbooks for tertiary education, but also provides digital infrastructure to a number of online education companies. Moreover, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), under its Project Kuiper, will be launching over 3,000 satellites into orbit with the goal of providing affordable internet to communities around the world that are currently underserved. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started working on this project in 2018 and received the license of deployment from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in July 2020. If achieved, this program could make it easier for millions of people to attain quality education using the internet.Story continuesMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s TechSpark program, which is aimed at providing digital skills and access to residents in rural areas of the US, has worked wonders in Northeast Wisconsin, where now 88% of the schools offer computer sciences education, catering to the requirements of the job market. In Jackson, Mississippi, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has launched a Cybersecurity Readiness Program at Jackson State University. The program involves training and providing cyber security experience to at least 100 students.Moreover, under this partnership between Mississippi and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), is another initiative called the CoBuilder Accelerator Program, which brings together entrepreneurs from startup companies and provides them with necessary training for their ventures. In addition to this, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers instructors and students at educational institutions to sign up for its Office 365 Education, which grants free access to platforms such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams. MethodologyWe have ranked the 20 least educated states in America using five weighted metrics – population aged between 18-24 with less than high school education (20%), population aged between 18-24 with high school graduation (15%), population aged between 18-24 with some college or associate degree (15%), population aged 25 and above with a bachelor’s degree (20%), and population aged 25 and above with a graduate or professional degree (30%).

More than 11% of the state’s youth has not completed high school education. Texas also ranks low when it comes to its share of the population that has completed graduation or master’s level education.19. IowaPopulation aged 18-24 less than high school: 10.9%Population aged 18-24 with high school graduation: 30.7%Population aged 18-24 with some college or associate degree: 46.9%Population aged 25 or above with bachelor’s degree: 20.7%Population aged 25 or above with graduate or professional degree: 9.9%Score: 16.57Iowa is situated in the upper Midwest region of the United States. It ranks 19th among the least educated states in America, mainly due to a significantly low percentage of the population holding bachelor’s and master’s degree qualifications.18. FloridaPopulation aged 18-24 less than high school: 13.2%Population aged 18-24 with high school graduation: 33.9%Population aged 18-24 with some college or associate degree: 41.3%Population aged 25 or above with bachelor’s degree: 20.6%Population aged 25 or above with graduate or professional degree: 12.6%Score: 16.54Just a little over one-fifths of Florida’s population aged 25 or above have completed a bachelor’s degree, while only 12.6% hold a graduate or professional degree.

However, a low percentage of the population attaining higher education remains a concern in the state, and is one of the reasons why Missouri ranks among the 25 Poorest States in America.15. OhioPopulation aged 18-24 less than high school: 11.7%Population aged 18-24 with high school graduation: 37.4%Population aged 18-24 with some college or associate degree: 38.5%Population aged 25 or above with bachelor’s degree: 18.9%Population aged 25 or above with graduate or professional degree: 11.8%Score: 16.37We discussed in our introduction about how education levels impact earnings. Ohio faces a problem related to disparity of income among its residents, with more than 12% of the population living below the poverty line. This can be attributed to the low percentage of its people that have attained higher education.14. KentuckyPopulation aged 18-24 less than high school: 10.3%Population aged 18-24 with high school graduation: 38.7%Population aged 18-24 with some college or associate degree: 39.5%Population aged 25 or above with bachelor’s degree: 15.9%Population aged 25 or above with graduate or professional degree: 11.1%Score: 16.18Kentucky is situated in the southeastern region of the United States. 10.3% of its population in the age group of 18-24 years has not completed high school education, according to the Census Bureau. The state fares low on higher education attainment as well, with around 15.9% of the population aged 25 or above having completed a bachelor's degree, while just 11.1% holding a graduate or professional degree. All of these factors combine to include Kentucky in the list of the least educated states in America.13. ArizonaPopulation aged 18-24 less than high school: 14.7%Population aged 18-24 with high school graduation: 35.9%Population aged 18-24 with some college or associate degree: 38.9%Population aged 25 or above with bachelor’s degree: 19.8%Population aged 25 or above with graduate or professional degree: 12.6%Score: 16.02Close to 15% of the youth in Arizona aged between 18 and 24 have not completed high school, around 36% of them have completed high school graduation, while 38.9% hold a college or associate degree. The major concern for the state is a considerably low percentage of population aged 25 or above who have obtained bachelor's and master's degrees.12. WyomingPopulation aged 18-24 less than high school: 7.1%Population aged 18-24 with high school graduation: 27.4%Population aged 18-24 with some college or associate degree: 42%Population aged 25 or above with bachelor’s degree: 18.5%Population aged 25 or above with graduate or professional degree: 10.7%Score: 15.90Due to a lower attainment of bachelor's and graduate degrees in Wyoming, the state ranks among the least educated states in America.

Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.GOOGL shares closed the week up 9% to $132.58.Microsoft tops estimates but warns of rising capex for AI investmentMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) beat on earnings for the second quarter, but shares lost ground after the company warned that capex should rise over the next several quarters in a race to meet strong AI demand.Story continues“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call.For Q2, Microsoft announced EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said CEO Satya Nadella.Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to drive meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on when these investments will ultimately pay off:Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and were off 2.2% for the week, closing Friday at $338.37.MetaMeta (NASDAQ:META) surged after the company said it earned $2.98 per share in the second quarter - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32B, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.The results come as Meta has continued to make progress on its ""year of efficiency"" pledge in 2022, and as advertising revenue climbed 12% to $31.50B. Meta increased its total expenses forecast ""due to legal-related"" costs while cutting its capex forecast. It also committed to continue hiring in key areas.After these results, Morgan Stanley hiked Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share, writing:META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.Bernstein was very bullish, as well, writing:They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.Shares were up 10% for the week to $325.48.IntelIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares surged 6.6% Friday after the company said it earned $0.13 per share in Q2, smashing the $0.04 consensus, and booked better-than-expected $12.9B in revenue.The surprise results came as the PC market began recovering from the post-pandemic hit it took over the past year, and Intel did see a 15% decline in revenue overall.But CEO Pat Gelsinger said these results ""exceeded the high end of our guidance as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, including building momentum with our foundry business and delivering on our product and process roadmaps.""For the third quarter, Intel expects revenue in the range of $12.9B-13.9B, the midpoint of which is slightly better than Wall Street's $13.23B consensus. Adjusted EPS is seen at $0.20, well above analyst expectations for $0.13.Bernstein lifted Intel's share-price target by $2 to $34, reflecting ""quite strong"" results, but kept its Market Perform rating on the stock. The analyst added, ""We admit to warming (very slightly) to it, but there is more than enough here to keep us sidelined for now.""Barclays also raised Intel's price target by $2, although the firm also remains quite cautious on the stock and stayed at Equalweight, commenting: ""[Intel] beat low hurdle on a quicker PC recovery but see little catalyst for growth and a hard transition roadmap to navigate.""Intel shares were up 8.8% to $36.83 for the week.Yasin Ebrahim, Senad Karaahmetovic, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.***Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the tech industry, head directly to 5 Best Small Cap Tech Stocks To Buy. The tech industry experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic, with strong performance in 2020 to 2021 but facing stock market declines in 2022. In 2023, tech companies continue to face challenges related to economic uncertainty, supply chains, workforce, and innovation. In the past five years, AI adoption has been driven by cost savings and gaining a competitive advantage. AI integration into user-facing applications has been subtle, leading to increased user counts and platform traffic. However, in early 2023, AI has gained significant attention and become a focal point for marketing. Despite this, RSM data indicates that private equity investment in emerging tech, particularly AI, remains low. Innovative AI companies often attract interest from large corporate buyers who incorporate their technology into existing services or scale it for larger markets. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella describes the current generation of AI as ""autopilot"" dictating attention through recommendations in search engines, social media, and streaming services. The next generation of AI, according to Nadella, will be a ""copilot"" that can be programmed using natural language, providing easier access to the software's capabilities for all users.Don't Miss: 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10According to JPMorgan's “Business Leaders Outlook Survey” conducted between November 29 and December 13, 2022,in which 265 midsize tech industry respondents expressed their views, majority of tech leaders were optimistic about the global (57%), national (58%), and local (63%) economies, significantly higher than leaders from midsize American businesses in general. Additionally, 77% were optimistic about their industry's performance in 2023, with 85% expressing optimism about their own company's performance. 84% of tech leaders anticipated increases in revenue/sales, and 73% expected growth in profits. Despite their positive outlook, tech leaders also expect challenges ahead. 55% of the candidates forecasted a recession in 2023. 76% were already feeling the effects of inflation, and nearly half had experienced worsening supply chain issues over the past year. To address these pressures, 51% of tech leaders were primarily focusing on raising prices and 43% were looking to increase automation. However, these challenges don't seem to hinder growth plans, as 84% of tech leaders intend to hire or retain employees in 2023. Approximately half of the respondents are coping with the tight labor market by offering employees flexibility in terms of where and when they work. Story continuesAlso Read: 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy NowMcKinsey observed that investment in most tech trends tightened compared to previous years in 2022, but there is still high potential for future growth, evident from the recent rebound in tech valuations. The total investment in tech exceeded $1 trillion, reflecting strong confidence in the field. Trust architectures and digital identity experienced the most remarkable growth among the 14 technology trends, increasing by nearly 50% as security, privacy, and resilience became crucial across industries. On the other hand, investment in other trends like applied AI, advanced connectivity, and cloud and edge computing declined, likely due to their maturity. To benefit from the explosive growth potential in tech, some of the best stocks that come to mind include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). However, in this article, we discuss the best small-cap tech stocks to buy. Our Methodology We first used a stock screener to filter out technology stocks with market caps ranging from $300 million to $2 billion as of July 28.

We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGYS) is one of the best tech stocks to invest in. Wasatch Micro Cap Growth—U.S. Strategy made the following comment about Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGYS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Agilysys, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGYS) was the top contributor to strategy performance during the fourth quarter. The company develops application software for point-of-sale, property-management, inventory and procurement applications. Agilysys specializes in the hospitality and retail industries world-wide, and its solutions can be implemented on wireless and mobile devices. The company recently modernized its software, which has proved fortuitous as post-pandemic consumer and business travel has accelerated. On December 15, Agilysys announced an agreement to deploy its cloud-based property-management system software across Marriott’s luxury, premium and select service hotels in the United States and Canada. Beyond the incremental earnings and cash flows related to Marriott, the agreement should help Agilysys win new customers on an ongoing basis.”11. Model N, Inc. (NYSE:MODN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Model N, Inc. (NYSE:MODN) provides cloud revenue management solutions for life sciences and high-tech companies. Its offerings include management tools such as Global Pricing Management, Global Tender Management, Provider Management, Payer Management, Government Pricing, Medicaid, Deal Management, Channel Management, Market Development Fund Management, Rebates Management, and Channel Data Management. On July 6, Goldman Sachs analyst Adam Hotchkiss initiated coverage of Model N, Inc.

(NYSE:MODN), compared to 20 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 400,937 shares worth $13.4 million. Conestoga Small Cap Strategy made the following comment about Model N, Inc. (NYSE:MODN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Model N, Inc. (NYSE:MODN): MODN optimizes revenue and compliance for life sciences and high-tech innovators. After being a leader during the fourth quarter, MODN gave back some of its 2022 gains during the first quarter. MODN reported robust fourth quarter results with ARR accelerating to 36% growth, net revenue retention hitting a high of 134% and billings jumping 23%. Despite better-than-expected results, the stock sold off 13% on the earnings report and didn’t recover during the balance of the quarter. We believe the sell-off was related to profit taking and/or future guidance not being raised more aggressively.”10. Harmonic Inc. (NASDAQ:HLIT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Harmonic Inc. (NASDAQ:HLIT) offers video delivery software, products, system solutions, and services worldwide. The company is divided into two segments – Video and Broadband. Harmonic Inc. (NASDAQ:HLIT) is one of the best technology stocks to invest in. On May 8, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.12, beating market consensus by $0.03. However, while the revenue increased 6.9% year-over-year to $157.6 million, it fell short of Street estimates by $0.26 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 25 hedge funds were bullish on Harmonic Inc. (NASDAQ:HLIT), compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Douglas T. Granat’s Trigran Investments is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.46 million shares worth $123.5 million. 9.

The company’s software solutions help optimize supply chains for blue-chip clients by integrating networks, data, and applications for channel shaping, demand sensing, business planning, global trade management, transportation, logistics, collaborative manufacturing, and supply management. E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) is one of the best technology stocks to monitor. On July 10, E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) reported a FQ1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.05, in line with market consensus. However, the revenue of $160.12 million slightly missed analysts’ forecasts by $0.5 million.

(NYSE:ETWO) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“E2open Inc. provides a 100% cloud-based software platform to orchestrate complex global supply chains. Its end-to-end SaaS solutions are mission critical. They drive compelling value and ROI for a diverse, blue-chip customer base (including Dell, Peloton, and Boeing) by helping them optimize their supply chains across channel shaping, demand sensing, business planning, logistics, global trade, and supply management.The market for supply chain management is large ($45 billion-plus market) and has only increased in complexity and importance due to the COVID pandemic. E2open’s deeply embedded products enable strong retention (107% net retention) and long customer relationships (top 100 customers have a 14-year average tenure). Relative to the competition, E2open has devised an elegant and simple solution that is faster and nimbler compared to legacy ERP vendors, and its single interface for all participants compares favorably to the many point solutions out in the market.E2open is poised to accelerate its organic revenue growth to about 10% in the upcoming fiscal year and maintain a low double-digit level over the medium term. Due to long-term contracts, the company has high visibility into future annual growth, and we expect acceleration will be driven by several factors, including expanding existing customer relationships ($1 billion whitespace alone), winning new customers, optimizing the sales force, getting better pricing realization, and enhancing strategic partnerships. Acquisitions are expected to be the primary use of free cash flow and should supplement the organic growth and provide meaningful synergies once integrated into E2open’s platform. The company has an attractive margin profile (low 30% increasing to high 30%’s adjusted EBITDA margins) paired with strong FCF generation. We believe that E2open will be a steady earnings compounder, which should drive solid returns for the stock over a multi-year period.”8. Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Next on our list of the best technology stocks is Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC), a semiconductor company that specializes in analog and mixed-signal products, along with advanced algorithms.

The stock sold off significantly after Semtech announced that it plans to acquire an IoT solutions provider in a deal that is expected to add significant scale benefits to the company but also to create a meaningful drag on its margin profile.”7. Impinj, Inc. (NASDAQ:PI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Impinj, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Impinj, Inc. (NASDAQ:PI) was also a contributor. The company, a pioneer in helping develop the Internet of Things, provides an infrastructure by which everyday things such as car parts and even shipment data communicate over the internet. Impinj offers a wireless inventory-management and tracking platform for customers in retail, manufacturing, health care and other areas. Tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips are used to connect, count and track individual items. Because Impinj is heavily reliant on integrated circuits, which were in short supply during the post-pandemic rebound, today’s slowing economy helps reduce this supply-and-demand imbalance, benefiting the company’s profitability. The stock soared when Impinj’s third-quarter earnings report and management’s forward guidance were well received by investors. Given the magnitude of the move in the stock, we sold some of our shares but maintained a healthy position.”6. Everbridge, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVBG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Everbridge, Inc.

Microsoft said its fees were “transparent and clear”.Story continuesAn Ofcom spokesman said: “We will carefully consider all views on our provisional findings in our interim report.”The final report is due to be published in October.An Amazon Web Services spokesman said: “The regulatory interventions proposed would be unwarranted, and could lead to significant unintended harm to customers and competition.”Microsoft declined to comment beyond its consultation submission.The row comes as Microsoft is locked in talks with the CMA to salvage its $69bn takeover of the Call of Duty videogames developer Activision.The regulator initially blocked the transaction, arguing it would hamper competition in video game streaming. It led Microsoft to angrily declare that Britain was no longer as attractive as Europe for starting a tech business.The CMA and Microsoft are now discussing a restructuring that could green light the merger.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

(NYSE:GS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President &amp; COO, John Waldron, for US$5.2m worth of shares, at about US$387 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$353. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders sold US$5.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$668m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Goldman Sachs Group Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Goldman Sachs Group.But note: Goldman Sachs Group may not be the best stock to buy.

20,e3bbfcca-c193-3ad5-8430-7cb9f9011a5a,NFLX,2023-07-30,Consumer demand for speed and convenience drives labor unrest among workers in Hollywood and at UPS,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-speed-convenience-drives-040216814.html,1690689736,STORY,"['SBUX', 'NFLX']","[NEW YORK (AP) — Six straight days of 12-hour driving. Single digit paychecks. The complaints come from workers in vastly different industries: UPS delivery drivers and Hollywood actors and writers.But they point to an underlying factor driving a surge of labor unrest: The cost to workers whose jobs have changed drastically as companies scramble to meet customer expectations for speed and convenience in industries transformed by technology.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated those changes, pushing retailers to shift online and intensifying the streaming competition among entertainment companies. Now, from the picket lines, workers are trying to give consumers a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to produce a show that can be binged any time or get dog food delivered to their doorstep with a phone swipe.That workers are overworked and underpaid is an enduring complaint across industries — from delivery drivers to Starbucks baristas and airline pilots — where surges in consumer demand have collided with persistent labor shortages. Workers are pushing back against forced overtime, punishing schedules or company reliance on lower-paid, part-time or contract forces.At issue for Hollywood screenwriters and actors staging their first simultaneous strikes in 40 years is the way streaming has upended the economics of entertainment, slashing pay and forcing showrunners to produce content faster with smaller teams.“This seems to happen to many places when the tech companies come in. Who are we crushing? It doesn’t matter,” said Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, a screenwriter and showrunner on the negotiating team for the Writers Guild of America, whose members have been on strike since May. Earlier this month, the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists joined the writers’ union on the picket line.Actors and writers have long relied on residuals, or long-term payments, for reruns and other airings of films and televisions shows. But reruns aren’t a thing on streaming services, where series and films simply land and stay with no easy way, such as box office returns or ratings, to determine their popularity.Story continuesConsequently, whatever residuals streaming companies do pay often amount to a pittance, and screenwriters have been sharing tales of receiving single digit checks.Adam Shapiro, an actor known for the Netflix hit “Never Have I Ever,"" said many actors were initially content to accept lower pay for the plethora of roles that streaming suddenly offered. But the need for a more sustainable compensation model gained urgency when it became clear streaming is not a sideshow, but rather the future of the business, he said.""Over the past 10 years, we realized: ‘Oh, that’s now how Hollywood works. Everything is streaming,’” Shapiro said during a recent union event.Shapiro, who has been acting for 25 years, said he agreed to a contract offering 20% of his normal rate for “Never Have I Ever” because it seemed like ""a great opportunity, and it’s going to be all over the world. And it was. It really was. Unfortunately, we’re all starting to realize that if we keep doing this we’re not going to be able to pay our bills.”Then there's the rising use of “mini rooms,” in which a handful of writers are hired to work only during pre-production, sometimes for a series that may take a year to be greenlit, or never get picked up at all.Sanchez-Witzel, co-creator of the recently released Netflix series “Survival of the Thickest,” said television shows traditionally hire robust writing teams for the duration of production. But Netflix refused to allow her to keep her team of five writers past pre-production, forcing round-the-clock rewrites with just one other writer.“It's not sustainable and I'll never do that again,” she said.Sanchez-Witzel said she was struck by the similarities between her experience and those of UPS drivers, some of whom joined the WGA for protests as they threatened their own potentially crippling strike. UPS and the Teamsters last week reached a tentative contract staving off the strike.Jeffrey Palmerino, a full-time UPS driver near Albany, New York, said forced overtime emerged as a top issue during the pandemic as drivers coped with a crush of orders on par with the holiday season. Drivers never knew what time they would get home or if they could count on two days off each week, while 14-hour days in trucks without air conditioning became the norm.“It was basically like Christmas on steroids for two straight years. A lot of us were forced to work six days a week, and that is not any way to live your life,” said Palmerino, a Teamsters shop steward.Along with pay raises and air conditioning, the Teamsters won concessions that Palmerino hopes will ease overwork. UPS agreed to end forced overtime on days off and eliminate a lower-paid category of drivers who work shifts that include weekends, converting them to full-time drivers. Union members have yet to ratify the deal.The Teamsters and labor activists hailed the tentative deal as a game-changer that would pressure other companies facing labor unrest to raise their standards. But similar outcomes are far from certain in industries lacking the sheer economic indispensability of UPS or the clout of its 340,000-member union.Efforts to organize at Starbucks and Amazon stalled as both companies aggressively fought against unionization.Still, labor protests will likely gain momentum following the UPS contract, said Patricia Campos-Medina, executive director of the Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, which released a report this year that found the number of labor strikes rose 52% in 2022.“The whole idea that consumer convenience is above everything broke down during the pandemic. We started to think, ‘I’m at home ordering, but there is actually a worker who has to go the grocery store, who has to cook this for me so that I can be comfortable,’” Campos-Medina said.___Associated Press video journalist Leslie Ambriz contributed from Los Angeles.]"

This makes the dividend yield 1.9%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Masco Masco's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, Masco was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 27.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 28%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMasco Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.30 total annually to $1.14. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Masco has impressed us by growing EPS at 14% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Masco's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Masco Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Masco that investors should take into consideration.

The downturn investors saw over the last two years has caused the stock prices of many well-established companies to plunge to historically low prices, due to short-term concerns about their profitability and revenue generation potential. However, buying into these businesses may be a great choice, since I have no doubt that well-established brands have what it takes to bounce back and surprise Wall Street.It’s worth noting that these low-cost stocks are also very low risk. If you compare them to the red-hot stocks right now, and weigh their returns over a multi-year timeframe, these undervalued gems are clear winners. Let’s dive into these three names right now.AT&amp;T (T)Image of Fiber optical connections with serversSource: ShutterstockYou can buy AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) for a bargain valuation of less than $15 per share, at the time of writing. Not only did this telecom stock decline to unreasonably low valuations due to the 2022 selloff, but the recent concerns around lead cables have worsened the stock’s position even more. That said, in my view, this is a great opportunity to snap up not just AT&amp;T, but Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FYBR) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). All three of these stocks are trading well below their intrinsic values right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, I will discuss stocks in other sectors in this article in order to provide more value to readers. So, let’s stick to AT&amp;T for now. The company generates very impressive revenue, and profits are expected to bounce back slowly. Currently, T stock also comes with a forward dividend yield of 7.6%. It is a very safe company if you consider its balance sheet, and the market has already priced in a lot of the lead cable litigation and dividend cut fears into the stock.If you’re willing to get on board here and weather the storm, you’ll be looking at enormous gains over the very long-term. That’s especially true if the company keeps its dividends steady. Right now, AT&amp;T is about as close to a no-brainer low-cost stock as it gets in this market right now.Story continuesTyson Foods (TSN)Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is trading a hair above $50 as of writing, and considering its upside potential from here, I recommend snapping up the stock right now. At the time of writing, TSN stock is down around 47% from its peak last year. However, the environment looks just right for the stock to start lifting off from here. That’s because Tyson operates a very stable business with enormous leverage over the consumer staples market. Expectations are also low due to earlier earnings misses, and I see little further downside risk here.In contrast, Gurufocus considers the stock as “significantly undervalued” and believes it will have a fair-price value of almost $90 by 2025. It also helps that TSN stock pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7% with 11 years of consecutive dividend increases.All things considered, Tyson Foods looks like nothing short of a bargain in this range.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersWhile PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) trades at around $75 per share, it is still a very low-cost stock. That’s partially due to the fact that PYPL stock used to trade around $120 even before the pandemic, making the current entry point with this high-growth stock simply too compelling to ignore. Of course, let’s address why PYPL stock is down first. The market has pushed this stock lower, mainly due to PayPal’s already-declining user accounts growth slowing down to a crawl. Even before Covid, user growth came in around 15% year-over-year, but this number has since declined to less than 1% annual growth. Now, PayPal has consistently squeezed out more in revenue from its existing user base, providing reasonable revenue growth of around 8.6% on a year-over-year basis.Despite these issues, I am confident that PayPal can recover. The company does operate in a highly-competitive environment. But its existing user base has proven to be very profitable, and willing to accept higher prices. PayPal is now a “mature” tech company, but still retains some headroom for growth, especially in some developing markets. And, I see the recovery of e-commerce as a long-term catalyst that will continue to support PayPal’s user growth. This payment platform is accepted almost everywhere online, and the recent slowdown in user growth isn’t the end of the world for this company. I believe PYPL stock can shoot past $150 or more over the next couple years, especially as its aggressive share buyback program picks up.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for WEC Energy Group is:11% = US$1.3b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.Does WEC Energy Group Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, WEC Energy Group has a higher ROE than the average (9.0%) in the Integrated Utilities industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for WEC Energy Group visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesWEC Energy Group's Debt And Its 11% ROEWEC Energy Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.48. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: WEC Energy Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$26.3bUS$27.7bUS$29.0bUS$30.0bUS$30.9bUS$31.7bUS$32.4bUS$33.2bUS$33.9bUS$34.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.79%Est @ 2.59%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.34%Est @ 2.27%Est @ 2.22% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$24.6kUS$24.2kUS$23.8kUS$23.0kUS$22.1kUS$21.3kUS$20.4kUS$19.5kUS$18.7kUS$17.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$216bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$35b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$746bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$746b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$384bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$599b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$174, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Johnson &amp; Johnson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Johnson &amp; JohnsonStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Johnson &amp; Johnson, we've put together three further items you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

According to Grand View Research, the global AI market size reached $136.55 billion in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030, reaching over $1.81 trillion by the end of the forecast period.

Valuations have soared to new heights this year, as the U.S. equities have broadly recovered from their losses in 2022. Now, it is imperative to find good bargains in high-growth sectors. In this article, we will highlight three undervalued AI stocks that are trading at attractive valuations and have strong growth prospects for the future.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)AI text on smartphone against background of green stock chart. Profit growth, share price, business success, investment and trading in artificial intelligence concept. AI stocks to buySource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a leading semiconductor company specializing in analog systems on chips (ASoCs) for AI applications, such as smart speakers, microphones, virtual assistants, gaming controllers, and automotive in-dash systems. The company’s products enable voice recognition, natural language processing, audio enhancement, and noise cancellation features for various devices. Skyworks Solutions has been growing its revenue and earnings consistently over the past few years, thanks to its exposure to the booming markets of 5G wireless technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence. In fiscal 2022, which ended on September 30, the company reported revenue of $5.4 billion, up 7% year over year (YoY) and a net income margin of 23%. This makes it one of those undervalued AI stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesHowever, despite its profitability and solid financial performance, Skyworks Solutions is trading at a relatively low valuation compared to its peers. As of July 19, 2023, the stock had a forward-looking 12-month EV/sales ratio of 4.1, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.0, and a P/E ratio of 14.1. Moreover, analysts are bullish on Skyworks Solutions’ future prospects. Currently, the consensus among 29 analysts covering the stock is a buy rating, with an average price target of $120.41, implying an upside potential of about 5% from its current price of $114.50.Qualcomm (QCOM)Illustration of robot hand reaching for the letters ""AI"" with tech symbols around it. AI tech stock predictionsSource: shutterstock.com/Allies InteractiveQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) is a global leader in wireless technology and semiconductors. The company designs and manufactures chips and software for smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, automotive, IoT, and AI devices. Qualcomm has exceptionally high exposure to the smartphone industry. For example, many smartphones running Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android operating system use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC).The semiconductor company is also a pioneer in developing and licensing 5G technology, which is essential for enabling high-speed data transmission and low-latency communication for AI applications. Thus, Qualcomm has been benefiting from the strong demand for its products and services amid the global rollout of 5G networks and devices. In their fiscal year 2022, which ended on September 25, the company reported revenue of $44.2 billion, up 32% YoY, and adjusted EPS of $11.41, up 45% YoY.Though Qualcomm will have a few hurdles to surmount, such as its deteriorating relationship with Apple, the company continues to be well-positioned to succeed in its end markets.Leidos (LDOS)Graphic of letters ""AI"" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buySource: shutterstock.com/Tex vectorLeidos (NYSE: LDOS) is a diversified technology company that provides solutions and services to a variety of government agencies covering various public initiatives, including defense, intelligence, civil, healthcare, and homeland security.The company leverages AI and machine learning (ML) to enhance its capabilities in areas such as cybersecurity, biometrics, data analytics, robotics, and autonomous systems. Leidos has been delivering solid revenue and earnings growth over the past few years, thanks to its diversified portfolio of contracts and acquisitions. In 2022, the company reported revenue of $14.4 billion, up nearly 5% YoY and a net income margin of 4.8%. 86% of the company’s revenue last year came from lucrative government contracts.However, Leidos is also trading at a bargain valuation due to having underperformed Wall Street’s expectations in its Q1’2023 earnings print. The government services specialist’s enterprise value is trading at around 1.2x forward sales and 11.4x forward EBITDA. Shares are also down more than 13% YTD. Despite this, the management team and Wall Street analysts are positive about Leidos’ future prospects. Leidos’ management team believes the company can continue to deliver solid organic growth and keep guidance unchanged. Additionally, the consensus among 15 analysts covering the stock is a buy rating, with an average price target of $105.69, implying an upside potential of about 17% from its current price of $90.55 as of July 19, 2023.On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

View our latest analysis for V.F The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At V.FThe Independent Director Mark Hoplamazian made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$491k worth of shares at a price of US$28.04 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$19.69. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.While V.F insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeV.F is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that V.F insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$54m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The V.F Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded V.F shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders own shares in V.F and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found 4 warning signs for V.F (2 shouldn't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

You can skip our detailed analysis of smart cities technology and its future, and go directly to read Top 5 Smart Cities in the World. The technological advancements in today's world leave almost everyone amazed. The transformation the world has undergone in the last two decades highlights the increasing significance of technology in shaping our future. Each day, we step into a new world filled with groundbreaking discoveries that captivate the entire globe. One such phenomenon is the concept of ‘smart cities’, which revolves around the integration of advanced technologies and data-driven solutions to improve the overall quality of life for residents and enhance the efficiency of urban services and infrastructure.According to the United Nations, around 70% of the world's population will reside in urban areas by 2050 (see 20 Largest Economies by 2050). As a result, emissions and energy consumption will continue to increase. To address these challenges, smarter urban solutions are necessary. This is where smart city programs and initiatives play a crucial role. By integrating smart technologies into urban areas, the quality of life for residents can be enhanced, and public safety can be improved.Although the concept of smart cities is still in its early stages, it is rapidly gaining momentum worldwide. Bloomberg reported Grand View Research’s data and highlighted that the global smart cities market was valued at roughly $1.1 trillion in 2021 and is projected to grow significantly to $6.9 trillion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.2% between 2022 and 2030.Various studies have highlighted that by integrating advanced technologies and data-driven solutions, smart cities can tackle urban challenges in a more efficient and effective manner. According to a report by McKinsey Global Institution published in 2018, digital applications have the potential to address practical and human concerns in cities. The report highlights that smart technologies can lead to significant improvements in key quality-of-life indicators, ranging from 10 to 30 percent. These improvements translate into saved lives, reduced crime incidents, shorter commutes, improved health outcomes, and lower carbon emissions.Story continuesSmart city projects often require significant investments in advanced technologies, infrastructure, and expertise. For this reason, leading companies in the US are actively involved in launching smart city initiatives. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) were among the pioneers, starting their work on the concept in 2009. IBM organized nearly 100 Smarter Cities Forums globally in 2009. The company initiated the Smarter Planet University jam to provide students with access to technology and training for acquiring new skills and supporting city projects worldwide. Moreover, from 2010 through 2017, IBM sent 800 top experts to assist over 130 cities through the Smarter Cities Challenge.Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s CityNext is a global initiative that aims to empower cities with intelligent solutions to address urban challenges and improve the quality of life for citizens. Through this program, Microsoft offers a wide range of solutions, including smart energy management, traffic optimization, public safety enhancements, citizen engagement platforms, and smart infrastructure monitoring. The company also took part in the 2021 Smart City Expo &amp; World Congress, an event that focused on urban innovation.As the benefits of smart cities become increasingly apparent, governments and private entities worldwide are investing significant resources in research, pilot projects, and large-scale implementations. The Indian government has allocated Rs 16,000 crore for its Smart Cities Mission. Additionally, they have introduced an urban infrastructure development fund for smaller towns and proposed reforms in urban planning and property tax to enhance sustainability. Considering the growing popularity of smart cities around the world, we have compiled a list of the top 20 smart cities in the world.Top 20 Smart Cities in the WorldOur Methodology:For this list, we used the IMD Smart City Index 2023, which is a survey that evaluates the perceptions of residents from 141 cities worldwide. It ranks these cities based on their infrastructure and technology services. The final score is calculated using perceptions from the last three years, with different weights assigned to each year.The survey focuses on two main aspects: Structures, which assesses existing infrastructure, and Technology, which evaluates technological provisions. Each aspect is further examined in five key areas: health and safety, mobility, activities, opportunities, and governance. The cities are grouped based on their Human Development Index (HDI) score, and within each group, they are assigned a 'rating scale' (AAA to D) based on their perceptions score relative to other cities in the same group.20.

With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$2.5b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 47%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Marathon Petroleum. View our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marathon Petroleum?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Marathon Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Marathon Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Marathon Petroleum. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Marathon PetroleumThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Marathon Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$83m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Marathon Petroleum. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Marathon Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Marathon Petroleum is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit concerning...Ultimately the future is most important.

We'll use ROE to examine Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pinnacle West Capital is:7.8% = US$481m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.Does Pinnacle West Capital Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Pinnacle West Capital has a similar ROE to the average in the Electric Utilities industry classification (8.9%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Pinnacle West Capital visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Pinnacle West Capital's Debt And Its 7.8% Return On EquityPinnacle West Capital does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.37. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Pinnacle West Capital may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Machine learning technology has found its way into a wide range of day-to-day activities, from internet searching to marketing and advertising to just driving down the highway. Artificial intelligence promises to change the way that we interact with the world and with computers, and the launch of ‘generative AI,’ embodied in real-language chatbots like ChatGPT, shows just how close that promise is.The emergence of any new technology brings with it an ever-proliferating array of opportunities, and AI is no exception. Tech firms all around the world are neck-deep in AI, from making the semiconductor chips that power the technology to developing the software that will interface between AI and us – to creating the new technologies that will build on machine learning.While tech companies at all scales are gravitating to AI, the larger tech firms have a leg up. They’re huge to begin with, some with trillion-dollar market caps; they are already industry leaders – and they’ve been involved in AI from the beginning. The giant tech titans have been leading the market gains we’ve seen so far this year, making those gains partly on AI.Market-leading positions and connections to a world-changing technology have helped put some of the tech giants on the Smart Score‘s ‘Perfect 10’ list. The Smart Score uses machine learning as well, to gather and collate the data behind thousands of publicly traded equities and assigns those stocks a simple score pointing toward likely future performance, based on 8 data-based factors.Considering all of this, the ‘Perfect 10’ tech titans are a logical place to look for riding the market on the way to new highs. Let’s take a closer look at two of them.Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)The first stock on our list of ‘Perfect 10s’ is Nvidia, one of the world’s leading semiconductor chip firms. Nvidia built its reputation on the strength of its graphics processing units, GPUs, chips designed to run advanced graphics programs and beloved by both professional graphic designers and high-level gamers. This niche nicely preadapted Nvidia for the advent of AI, as the company’s GPUs are also capable of handling the high processing demands of AI computing.Story continuesDemand for AI-capable chips has been booming all year, and Nvidia has realized strong gains as a direct result – the stock is up over 226% year-to-date. It’s no surprise that Nvidia is a major supplier of GPU chips for OpenAI, the company that launched ChatGPT last November. OpenAI has been using Nvidia’s chips in its machine learning applications – ‘teaching’ its AI – since 2020, and has already indicated a need for another 10,000 chips to maintain ChatGPT going forward. This can only bode well for Nvidia, which is already one of the select few $1 trillion-plus companies in the stock market.The rapid expansion of AI has led to solid beats compared to the financial expectations in Nvidia’s last financial release. In the company’s last quarterly report, for Q1 of fiscal year 2024, it showed total revenues of $7.19 billion, a total that was down 13% year-over-year but was also $669 million above the forecasts. The company’s earnings were also higher than had been anticipated; at $1.09 per share, the non-GAAP EPS beat the forecast by 17 cents per share. The company finished its fiscal Q1 with over $5 billion in cash and other liquid assets on hand, compared to $3.9 billion in in the prior year quarter.Investors were also mightily impressed by Nvidia’s forward guidance. The chip maker is guiding toward $11 billion in fiscal Q2 sales, far above the $7.11 billion consensus figure. Hitting that guidance will equate to a 41% y/y revenue gain.All of this – but especially the company’s strong link to AI and its ability to generate cash – brought Nvidia to the attention of 5-star analyst Chris Caso, from Wolfe Research. Caso writes of Nvidia’s attraction for investors, “There is now little investor debate about NVDA’s dominance of AI, or the potential growth rates. The main question is whether there is still room for the stock to move further, given the big move and elevated valuation – we think there is given NVDA’s strong FCF. We think it’s unprecedented to have a company growing this fast (30% 8-year CAGR, 35% 3-year CAGR), and still throw off this much cash (~2.2% FCF yield even after &gt;200% YTD stock gain). That cash flow, coupled with NVDA’s dominant position in AI, keep us in the stock despite the move.”Caso gives NVDA an Outperform (Buy) rating, and his price target, set at $570, implies the stock will gain another 22% in the year ahead. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here.)The giant tech firms pick up plenty of reviews from Wall Street, and Nvidia has 32 recent calls on file – including 30 to Buy and 2 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $467.5, and the stock’s $504.46 average price target suggests a 12-month appreciation of 8%. (See Nvidia’s stock forecast.)Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL)The second AI-related stock on today’s list is Alphabet, the parent of Google and an array of other subsidiaries – many of which are tied directly into AI. For Google, of course, the connection is obvious – Google has been the dominant player in internet search for decades, and for much of that time has been using AI-powered algorithms to enhance its search modes. Google also uses AI in its digital advertising applications, which are the go-to for online marketing companies.Alphabet’s other AI-related enterprises cover a range of niches, including AI research (DeepMind), drone-based local air-freight delivery (Wing), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and YouTube, the web’s premier video search engine. Alphabet is also advancing its head-to-head competitor to ChatGPT, an AI chatbot called Bard. While Alphabet does not have a leading position in every AI niche, it’s a strong competitor – and the company’s long history with AI development gives it an edge in creating workable systems quickly.All of this has powered Alphabet’s growth. Its attraction for investors has supported the stock price – and pushed the market cap up to $1.63 trillion, the third-highest among publicly traded firms.The stock has also obviously benefited from strong financial results, such as those on display in the recent Q2 readout, which beat the forecasts all around. Top line revenues at $74.6 billion, beat expectations by $1.84 billion and grew 7% year-over-year, while the bottom-line EPS, at $1.44, was 10 cents per share over the estimates.For Truist analyst Youssef Squali, Alphabet’s AI connection, amongst other elements, informs his bullish take. Explaining his stance, the 5-star analyst writes, “We remain constructive on GOOGL following stronger than expected 2Q23 results, reflecting faster recovery for Search and YT, and sustained momentum in Cloud as mgmt reigns in costs and focuses investments on the highest growth priorities. We expect to see further growth acceleration in 2H23 with margins improving, supporting a compelling case for the stock N/M term. LT, while questions about AI’s impact on Search advertising remain, we believe that GOOGL is at the forefront of this race and expect mgmt to continue to lean in, more assertive in the rollout of its AI initiatives and in how it communicates them.”Squali goes on to rate the stock as a Buy, with a $160 price target pointing toward 21% share gains over the next 12 months. (To watch Squali’s track record, click here.)There are 35 recent analyst reviews of Alphabet on file and they break down 30 to 5 favoring Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares have a current trading price of $132.58 with an average price target of $149.45, indicating a 13% one-year gain.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks That Will Go Up 1000 Percent.There are only two ways to make money by investing in the stock market. The first is being extremely lucky and getting rich fast via speculative stocks. Of course this way does not bring sustainable gains and often end up wiping all gains overnight. After all speculation cannot stand the market tests and one cannot get lucky every time. The second way to generate wealth via stock investing is to stick to the age-old and tried and tested investing principles. One such principle is buying solid stocks and holding them. In an interesting document entitled IS BUY AND HOLD DEAD? NOT SO FAST, Brock Gearhart and Mary Ann Greenwood from Greenwood &amp; Associates share an interesting chart showing  20 year simple moving average of returns of the stock market from 1950 to 2008. The analysts say that “the long-term investor who can see beyond annual returns stands to benefit from the fact that financial markets, over the long-term, tend to rise.”When an investor invests in solid businesses that have long-term growth catalysts, with an intention to buy and hold these stocks for decades, enjoying over 1000% gains does not sound speculative or too good to be true. In the Russell 1,000, 33 companies gained over 1,000% since April 2013 through April 2023. Some of these ten-baggers include Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Plug Power (PLUG), AMD (AMD), Enphase Energy (ENPH) and Broadcom (AVGO).How to Find Ten-Baggers?The term ten-bagger was coined by legendary investor Peter Lynch. In his book “One Up On Wall Street” Lynch talks at length about ten-baggers and how to spot them. In a chapter titled “Talking the Tenbagger” Lynch says:""The best place to begin looking for the tenbagger is close to home—if not in the backyard then down at the shopping mall, and especially wherever you happen to work. With most of the tenbaggers already mentioned— Dunkin’Donuts, The Limited, Subaru, Dreyfus, McDonald’s, Tambrands, and Pep Boys —the first sips of success were apparent at hundreds of locations across the country. The fireman in New England, the customers in central Ohio where Kentucky Fried Chicken first opened up, the mob down at Pic ’N’ Save, all had a chance to say, “This is great; I wonder about the stock,” long before Wall Street got its original clue. The average person comes across a likely prospect two or three times a year—sometimes more. Executives at Pep Boys, clerks at Pep Boys, lawyers and accountants, suppliers of Pep Boys, the firm that did the advertising, sign painters, building contractors for the new stores, and even the people who washed the floors all must have observed Pep Boys’ success. Thousands of potential investors got this “tip,” and that doesn’t even count the hundreds of thousands of customers.”Story continuesThe Ten-Baggers of TomorrowBuilding on Peter Lynch’s philosophy, Alexander Green, the Chief Investment Strategist of The Oxford Club, in a 2016 note entitled The Ten-Baggers of Tomorrow, identified some common characteristics of ten-bagger stocks. According to Green, ten-baggers are “tremendous innovators.” The analyst gives examples of Tesla and Apple as these companies disrupted their respective industries and set new trends, creating huge gains for investors. Another property of ten-baggers is that they have strong sales growth. Green emphasizes “sales growth” here and says he’s not talking about profits here since many innovative companies do not make profits in the start.Another important and common characteristic of ten-bagger stocks according to Green is that they are usually small-cap and mid-cap stocks. The reason is simple. Small companies have the potential to post explosive gains and unlike large, mature companies, they haven’t yet reached their true potential.Green says:A study by the Chicago research firm Ibbotson Associates reveals that every dollar invested in a basket of large cap stocks in 1926 and held through the end of May of this year – with dividends reinvested – would have grown to more than $5,200. But every dollar invested in a basket of small cap stocks would have grown over the same period to more than $25,100. Huge companies simply can’t grow at the breakneck pace of smaller companies.Our MethodologyFor this article we consulted a variety of credible sources and analysts reports and picked 10 stocks that are most frequently labeled as ten-baggers or as having the potential to gain close to or over 1000% over the next 5-15 years.

But investors wanting to know how to invest in AI should consider these companies.Artificial intelligence is already writing our kids' essays, driving cars, producing new computer programs and helping scientists seek cures for cancer. It also promises lower costs and bigger profit margins for millions of businesses.By 2030, a new report from the consulting firm McKinsey predicts AI could increase global productivity by more than 3%, adding trillions to the world's wealth. Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, who knows a thing or two about technology, calls AI a ""revolutionary"" development that will likely soon ""be able to do everything that a human brain can, but without any practical limits. This new technology can help people everywhere improve their lives.""There's a dark side to AI, too: It might also empower criminals, eliminate millions of jobs or even spin out of control and kill us all, say AI alarmists.Is it a good idea to invest in AI?Extravagant claims about the potentially world-changing impacts of computers that can learn and reason on their own are raising hopes – and fears – around the world. The hype is also sending the stocks of AI-related companies soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose at almost double the S&amp;P 500's 17% pace in the first half of 2023. And most of that was driven by a handful of AI-related firms. Nvidia (NVDA), which designs the chips used in more than 90% of AI applications (according to technology industry research firm CB Insights), returned an eye-popping 190% over the period. Many AI-related stocks trade at more than 40 times next year's expected earnings – about twice the level of the overall market.That creates challenges for investors interested in benefiting from AI but afraid of a repeat of 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. Big technological innovations ""are often overhyped in the near term,"" warns Dan Fletcher, portfolio manager of the DWS Science and Technology Fund. But ""they are underappreciated for the long term."" He predicts that AI will have ""very profound effects"" over the next decade.Story continuesRight now, ""the market is indiscriminate,"" Fletcher says, inflating many companies with only tangential connections to AI, whose transformative promise is only beginning to be understood. But there's still opportunity for disciplined investors who do their homework and either have an investment horizon long enough to withstand potential volatility or who can wait to buy during the inevitable dips. Veteran tech analysts say investors should ask three key questions to find companies with good chances to win the AI race:How real is the firm's commitment to AI? During the current frenzy, ""every company is going to be saying it is using AI,"" says Afroz Jaffri, an artificial intelligence expert at research firm Gartner. ""Those claims need to be verified.""Longtime portfolio manager Gregg Fisher, who currently runs Quent Capital, an asset management firm, says he checks the résumés of company leaders and in-house technologists to see if they really have AI expertise. And he looks at company statements from the past several years: Did the company use data analytics and machine learning before AI became all the rage? And, importantly, what percentage of a firm's revenues and profits are AI-related?Are the business and the stock fundamentally sound? Ryan Jacob, manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, says one lesson from the dot-com bust is that investors who ignore fundamentals will get burned. A strong balance sheet showing that a company has the resources to compete and expand is a must, he says. As for stocks, recognize that fast-growing companies should be analyzed with growth and opportunity in mind, says Fisher. But don't fall for claims that ""price-earnings ratios don't matter anymore,"" he says.What part of the AI chain does the company serve? Businesses in nearly every sector will be experimenting with ways to profit from AI. Many, if not most, of those efforts will fail. Many experts say that for now, it is safer to invest in the companies that provide AI tools to the experimenters. DWS's Fletcher says that means generally focusing on firms that design or make AI-related equipment or software for others to use. ""We think infrastructure is the first place to go,"" he says.How to invest in AIBelow, we list five of the best AI stocks to buy. These companies are well grounded in AI and should have the wherewithal to survive in a highly volatile sector. Meanwhile, investors who are looking for broader exposure will want to check out Kiplinger's roundup of the best AI ETFs. Prices, returns and other data are as of June 30, unless otherwise noted.Chip designer Broadcom (AVGO), a big player in cable set-top boxes and ethernet routers, has ramped up production of AI-related semiconductors. Chief executive Hock Tan told investors in June that AI revenue will likely hit $4 billion in fiscal 2023 (ending in October), making up about 11% of total annual revenue. He expects AI-related sales to soar to as much as $7 billion in fiscal 2024. The firm is on pace to earn more than $42 a share in fiscal 2023, up 12% from the prior year and about 50% from fiscal 2021.Broadcom has benefited from this year's AI stock boom. The shares jumped 57% in the first half. But in part because Broadcom's profits are booming as well, the stock's price-earnings ratio based on expected earnings was below the tech industry average of about 20. That is one reason the company is a favorite of the Columbia Seligman Technology and Information Fund, whose mission is to find ""growth at a reasonable price."" The semiconductor stock is one of the fund's top three holdings. Comanager Shekhar Pramanick says Broadcom should benefit in 2024 as firms increase spending on AI to infuse it into more of their processes. ""Everybody wants to experiment,"" he says.Thanks to its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, 48-year old tech survivor Microsoft (MSFT) has a head start on making money from AI. It is already incorporating ChatGPT into its Bing internet search engine. And Microsoft is licensing its AI services, such as its speech recognition model, so smaller companies can create their own AI applications.Angelo Zino, senior stock analyst at CFRA Research, expects annual AI-related sales at Microsoft to reach $10 billion by the end of 2023 – equivalent to almost 5% of the company's expected $211 billion in annual sales – then ""grow exponentially"" for the next few years. Microsoft ""is an obvious play"" for any investor who wants to jump on the AI train, he says. Its investment in OpenAI gives Microsoft a say in which companies will get access to that system. Combine that with the company's huge size and dominance in areas such as office software, and you get ""extreme pricing power,"" he says.Dominic Rizzo, manager of T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund, likes the prospects for Microsoft's ""Copilot"" AI services. The applications are already helping programmers generate code faster and are being added to Windows and Microsoft 365 to help office workers with tasks such as creating Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations. Microsoft makes up more than 10% of the fund's portfolio. Though the shares trade at 32 times expected earnings, Rizzo calls the premium P/E ""reasonable when you consider Microsoft's best-in-class business model, customer relationships and AI positioning.""Nvidia, a company long prized for its video game graphics cards, is at the heart of the AI revolution. Its chips, which can handle many more tasks concurrently than can standard chips, make up the brains behind ChatGPT and are the basis for AI applications such as smartphone digital assistants, self-driving cars and surgical robots.The chip industry overall suffered as sales of cell phones and laptops slumped over the past year. But Nvidia's sales have skyrocketed from $11 billion in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2020, to almost $27 billion for the most recent fiscal year. For the quarter ending April 30, the company reported earnings of $1.09 a share, down from $1.36 a share in the same quarter a year ago but well above the 92 cents a share expected by a consensus of Wall Street analysts. Sales were $7.2 billion for the quarter, compared with expectations of $6.5 billion. Nvidia executives said they expected sales of roughly $11 billion for the July quarter.Nvidia's potential is no secret – the stock has shot up from roughly $100 a share in the summer of 2020 to $423 recently. It remains well loved on Wall Street, with nearly three-fourths of the analysts who follow the stock recommending it. But the run-up has led many investors not yet holding Nvidia shares to ask whether they've missed out. Others worry about the firm facing increasing competition or stricter regulation here and abroad.Whether to buy now depends on your time horizon, says Matthew Moberg, manager of the Franklin DynaTech Fund, which has 6% of its portfolio in Nvidia shares. The stock, trading at 47 times expected earnings, will likely be volatile and is not a good choice for short-termers at current levels, he says. ""If you have a long-term investing time frame – five to 10 years – you shouldn't worry about the run-up,"" he says. ""I feel really good about Nvidia. It still has room to grow.""Synopsys (SNPS) is a Mountain View, Calif.–based company that provides software to help companies such as Nvidia design and produce AI chips. Synopsys gets a double benefit from AI, says Gary Mobley, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, because it makes money by selling software to AI designers and saves money by using AI to help write the software it sells.Demand for new kinds of AI chips is expected to increase the company's revenues by more than 14%, to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2023, which ends October 31; earnings are expected to jump over 20%, to nearly $11 per share. The stock has returned 36% so far in 2023. Despite the gain and a P/E of 37, Mobley says he thinks the stock is ""still relatively undiscovered."" Fletcher, the DWS portfolio manager, says Synopsys is in great shape to ride the AI boom, with no debt and very few competitors, which gives the company some pricing power.Investors focused on AI chip designers, such as Broadcom and Nvidia, may not realize that another company – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) – actually produces most of the silicon circuits that power artificial brains. As the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry, the firm's fortunes rise and fall with the notoriously cyclical chip sector.AI demand helped boost TSM's annual sales by roughly 30% in 2022, to about $73 billion. Because of the time and expense required to build new chip factories, the firm has few competitors, resulting in high profit margins during booms. The company reported its net profit margin (profits as a percentage of sales) expanded by more than seven percentage points in 2022, to 45%.The shares trade as American depositary receipts on the New York Stock Exchange at a P/E below the U.S. market's average. One reason for the discount: Many investors are concerned about mainland China's threats to claim Taiwan. The firm is building plants in the U.S. and Japan to reduce its geopolitical risk.For now, the shares attract value-seekers such as T. Rowe Price's Rizzo, who has made the company the fund's third-largest holding. ""Taiwan Semiconductor is the best-in-class semiconductor foundry,"" he says, adding that AI will power significant growth for the company over the next 18 to 24 months. Morningstar analyst Phelix Lee agrees that the shares are attractively priced, trading about 30% below his estimate of their fair value.Note: This item first appeared in Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, a monthly, trustworthy source of advice and guidance.

Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordBlackrock’s CEO says art is a ‘serious asset class’ — here’s how you can own a piece of a Pablo PicassoTravel analysts have clocked a dip in Disney’s theme parks visits that’s unusual for the peak summer months. Touring Plans, a company that tracks wait times for rides at various theme parks, has reported shorter wait times in Orlando-based Disney World and Disneyland in California in recent weeks.The average wait time for a Disney ride was 27 minutes this year during the holidays, down from 31 minutes in 2022 and 47 minutes in 2019, according to Touring Plans analysis.Disney’s management team had already lowered its parks earnings forecast in a recent quarterly report. Now the parks are also offering discounts for Christmas — which means they could expect the attendance slump to drag into another one of its typically busiest seasons.Where is everyone?In July, Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis told radio hosts on the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show that Disney’s “woke agenda” was to blame for the theme park’s lack of ticket sales. DeSantis and the entertainment giant have been embroiled in an ongoing battle over issues related to sex- and gender-identity education in schools. Conservatives supportive of DeSantis have been pushing for a boycott of the parks and the company’s streaming platform.And the battle doesn't end there. In addition to two other lawsuits, DeSantis’ appointees to a board that oversees Disney World’s governing district launched a new complaint against Disney on Monday, calling $2.5 million in free passes and discounts for district employees unethical, according to a Tuesday report from the Associated Press.Story continuesBut the data suggests those aren't the only factors at work here. Universal Park — a Disney rival that hasn’t been part of the ongoing culture war — saw its lowest attendance on record this past Independence Day, according to recent data. Six Flags and SeaWorld have also recorded lower attendance in recent months.With a recession looming and Americans’ saving rates declining, consumers may simply be holding off on shelling out on expensive family vacations like visiting theme parks. Research from the Federal Reserve found that American households had completely depleted their pandemic-era excess savings.Meanwhile, travel agents have pointed to higher ticket prices as a major factor in declining theme park attendance. On top of that, trips to Europe appear to be cannibalizing demand for domestic theme parks this year — likely both contributing to the downturn. In addition to the stormy political climate, experts also point to extreme weather and heat in Florida as a contributing factor.But regardless of why Disney is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad season, it may turn out to be a magical opportunity for eager investors.Read more: This janitor in Vermont built an $8M fortune without anyone around him knowing.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&amp;A, John Faucher.John Faucher: Thank you, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q2 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release.A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q2 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2023 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&amp;A. Noel?Noel Wallace: Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So a few quick thoughts this morning on our strong quarter of top and bottom line growth and clearly along with the improved 2023 outlook we provided. On the first quarter call, you'll recall, I highlighted three priorities for the year, driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons, executing on productivity and revenue growth management to fund brand investment, while also delivering on our earnings targets, and improving our cash flow performance. While not without its challenges, in Q2, we made strong progress on all three of these. On organic sales growth, Q2 showed the strength of our global portfolio as we delivered our strongest quarterly growth on a two-year stack basis since Q3 2008, with both organic volume and pricing growth accelerating on a two-year stack basis.Story continuesGirl shopping, Girl in supermbarket, girl with shopping cartCopyright: nicoletaionescu / 123RF Stock PhotoWe delivered organic sales growth in all six divisions and in each of our categories grew in the mid-single digits or higher. We are laser-focused on returning to balanced organic sales growth and we believe the investments we are making, combined with easier comparisons, give us a path to improved volume growth going forward as we leverage increased brand support and innovation while still delivering profit growth. The strength of our revenue growth management efforts, combined with our progress on funding the growth, drove improvement in our gross margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Base Business SG&amp;A was down 30 basis points in the quarter. A strong sales growth, lower logistics costs and the benefits of our 2022 global productivity initiative drove operating leverage even as we increased advertising spending by 20%.Combined with our gross margin expansion, we delivered 60 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter. This enabled us to deliver upside versus expectations in the quarter despite continued pressure from below the line items, including the impact of higher interest rates and tax. As you've heard me say, it's just virtuous combination of growth driven leverage, revenue growth management, cost containment and productivity to drive investments in capabilities and brand building which drove the strong quality of this quarter's results. We believe it also lays the groundwork for our performance across the balance of the year and into the future. And finally, our strong cash flow performance continued in the quarter, which is helping us offset some of these below the line headwinds.Free cash flow was up more than 50% in the quarter and is more than up -- up more than 80% year-to-date through net income growth and improved working capital performance and pleasingly, particularly in inventories and payables. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead of us. Our goal is to deliver consistent, high quality compounded top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value. And I believe Colgate-Palmolive has the brands, the global footprint and the people to deliver. So with that, I'll turn it over to the Q&amp;A.See also 11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy and Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 Aristocrats.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.92bUS$3.18bUS$3.37bUS$3.53bUS$3.68bUS$3.80bUS$3.92bUS$4.03bUS$4.13bUS$4.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Est @ 6.02%Est @ 4.85%Est @ 4.03%Est @ 3.45%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.57%Est @ 2.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.7kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$91bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$91b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$47bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$72b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$75.6, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Reported EPS is $2.63 EPS, expectations were $2.84.Operator: Good morning, and thank you for holding, welcome to Aon Plc's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.Greg Case: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We're pleased to report that our global team delivered another strong quarter, performance, results and momentum. And we begin the call today by thanking our colleagues for everything they do to help our clients address immediate and long-term demands around the risk and people. United delivered by our colleagues, gives us the ability to meet this demand and balance across our portfolio. capitalizing on innovation and momentum and investing to meet demand.This ensures we win more, retain more and do more with our clients. There is now almost universal agreement to client demand to address risk and human capital has never been greater. For example, our catastrophe insight report estimated global economic losses for natural disasters in the first half of 2023 and were $194 billion, notably above the 21st century average of $128 billion and fifth highest on record. Even more profound, in addition to economic costs, we know these disasters have tragic human costs that reinforces the high value and building resiliency and protection in advance of disaster. To this end, we recently announced the placement of the Parametric insurance program for the government of Puerto Rico. It's the single largest program of its kind that the U.S. Commonwealth has ever placed.Story continuesThis program was designed by our reinsurance and commercial risk teams. And in the event of a sizable earthquake or hurricane, Puerto Rico will quickly receive liquidity and enabling its government to focus on rapid recovery and reconstruction. This placement was the result of Aon's data, analytics and capabilities from across our firm, cemented by our deep understanding of public entity demand, risk capital and reinsurance markets and really, really great work by our team. Turning to financial performance. In the second quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across our solution line, including 10% growth in health solutions and 9% growth in reinsurance solutions contributing to 6% overall organic growth in the quarter and 7% in the first half.In health solutions and a revenue growth of 10% on top of 11% last year was driven by strength in the core. Our team has done terrific work, helping clients navigate the demands of their talent agendas balancing optimal benefits for their people with inflationary cost pressures while also taking steps to deliver on their people strategy at a time when bringing total rewards, health and wealth benefits together is human capital are more important than ever. In reinsurance solutions, our team delivered another very strong quarter at 9% organic growth on top of 9% last year. Driven by strong net new business generation, our teams continue to help clients navigate a challenging and complex market and are already preparing data, analytics and insight as we help our clients understand and address ongoing volatility and capital considerations.We're also seeing capital come into the market, particularly in cat bonds as our team has placed over $5 billion across 21 deals year-to-date. In wealth solutions, we delivered 2% organic growth driven by ongoing trends in demand we've seen in project work around market volatility and regulatory changes, as well as the ongoing trend of pension derisking, which we expect to continue in the quarters coming ahead, given the market conditions. We continue to see opportunity to help clients react and prepare for regulatory changes, and market volatility with our data analytics and expertise. And finally, commercial risk solutions delivered 5% organic growth in the quarter. Globally, we saw strong growth across most major geographies with double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific.In the U.S., we saw strength in core retail brokerage, including from property, casualty, and construction. As we've communicated previously, results were pressured by the impact of external M&amp;A and IPO markets on M&amp;A services, a headwind we now expect to continue in the back half of the year, given ongoing external conditions. Overall, in the quarter, our strong performance was driven by the strength of our Aon United strategy and Al Business Services platform. In Q2, we translated 6% organic revenue growth into 110 basis points of operating margin expansion. Net of ongoing investment in the business for long-term growth. These results contributed to first half financial performance of 7% organic revenue growth and 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.And we remain very well positioned to maintain this momentum and to deliver on our ongoing financial guidance of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth for 2023 and the long term. This financial performance is ultimately the product of our ability to address client needs to Aon United. And this strength is foundational in supporting our ability to evolve in response to changing client demand, fully demonstrated by our move to risk capital and human capital. This focus is bringing our 4 solution lines more closely together to better address client needs and is already yielding meaningful client impact. Take human capital. Our clients are changing how they're thinking about their colleagues.We're facing an increasingly complex external environment with pressures around cost, growth, remote and hybrid work and workforce composition. On their own internal environment, their people strategies are increasingly complex, considering traditional total rewards and health benefits and newer additions around future skills and well-being. Our connectivity and across health, wealth and talent, enables us to bring data, analytics and solutions to address this need. In one great example, our team developed a diagnostic tool for clients that produces a human sustainability index, or HSI this tool combines individual and team assessments with peer data and analytics-based benchmarking to enable our clients to directly connect people strategy goals to execution.The measurable results encompassing 8 wellness pathways such as physical, emotional and financial aspects, supports individuals and teams to assess exactly what's working and for whom, along key metrics, so our clients can adjust or change their tactics to drive their people strategy and ultimately, their bottom line. In many respects, this work represents bringing next level data science into talent development and leadership. Ultimately, the HSI solution identifies gaps and what our clients offer to their people, encompassing health, wealth, rewards, and other wellness programs, and it provides a trackable plan to strengthen the company's talent strategy on their most significant often external commitments at a time when these commitments are more important than ever.In summary, our strong performance is a direct result of our ability to help clients better understand their challenges and opportunities and to take actions to protect their business and improve their performance. Further, our recently announced enhanced focus on risk capital and human capital is already driving benefits and strengthening this capability. Our strong year-to-date financial results, including 7% organic revenue growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion, on the direct outcome of the strategy and position us very well to continue delivering in 2023 and over the long term. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?Source: PEXELSChrista Davies: Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we continued delivering on our key financial metrics, both in the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first half, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. These results position us very well to continue to drive results in 2023 and over the long term, and we look forward to building on this momentum. As I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q2 and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 7% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date -- sorry, 6% in Q2, 7% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date, includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 1% for Q2 and 2% year-to-date, primarily driven by a strong dollar versus most currencies.I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, with $64 million in Q2 and $116 million year-to-date or 2% of total revenue in both periods. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 33.6% in the first half, an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue growth and efficiencies from May on business services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. Looking forward, we expect to deliver sustainable margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've said previously, Aon Business Services remains one of our key drivers of margin improvement, and this operating model has now reached an inflection point.In response to client demand and the opportunity, we're evolving to an organization that drives efficiency, operating leverage and margin expansion to one that's also increasingly driving improved client service delivery and accelerating innovation at scale. This evolution of Aon Business Services requires investment in three areas, which we expect to manage in line with our ongoing financial guidance and like we do for all investments in long-term growth, on a disciplined ROIC basis. First, standardized platforms. We're digitizing and connecting existing platforms and creating an ecosystem that encompasses technology and operations that brings our data, analytics and expertise together for our clients and our colleagues. Second, standardized operations.Across our solution lines, there are places where we have common processes. We see opportunity to continue to bring operations and expertise together across our firm, to support clients across all solution lines, bringing people and process together, drive further efficiency enables us to scale best practices. Third, new products at scale. We see significant opportunity to deliver new data-driven products, which we can then effectively develop and scale. The work we've done to standardize platforms and operations enable us to rapidly develop, deliver and scale innovative solutions across the portfolio. In response to client demand and to deliver content and capability to all clients both from organic or inorganic investments. Even more importantly, operating Aon Business Services as one organization with disciplined prioritization and governance around initiatives ensures we can move quickly on opportunities that create value for our clients and colleagues, such as the one we see on AI.Just as a few examples. We see real opportunity here to enhance colleague productivity by leveraging the services of our technology partners in a protected environment to enhance existing offerings like our human capital assistance by building an AI risk framework for our clients. And finally, to create complementary data sets to enhance our risk analytics like the catastrophe modeling. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 5% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 in the quarter and $0.19 per share year-to-date. If currency is to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no impact in the third quarter and a favorable impact of $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter for an unfavorable impact of $0.14 per share for full year 2023.I'd also note, other nonoperating expense had a $0.25 per share or 10% unfavorable impact in Q2, and a $0.44 per share or 6% unfavorable impact year-to-date. This reflects an unfavorable impact from increase in noncash net periodic pension expense, as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period and balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Cash from operations was flat year-over-year and free cash flow decreased 7% to $986 million, primarily driven by a $77 million increase in CapEx. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally stronger than the first half.We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year. CapEx was elevated in the first half of the year compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects with spend heavily weighted in the first half across technology to drive long-term growth like the investments we're making to evolve Aon Business Services. I'd note CapEx can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We expect CapEx to moderate in the back half of the year and now expect an investment of $220 million to $250 million in CapEx in 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis. Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvement.Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today highlighted by approximately $1.1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capability that we can scale to address unmet client need. Our M&amp;A pipeline continues to be focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity.We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. As we've said before, we expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA growth over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit profile. I'd note our term debt is all fixed rate with an average weighted interest rate of approximately 4% and an average weighted maturity of approximately 11 years. In summary, our strong financial results for the quarter and year-to-date reflects strong operational performance driven by our Aon United strategy and our Aon Business Services platform. We expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value creation.With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.See also 10 Best Regional Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy and 11 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy Today.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of potato production and consumption trends in the country, read 8 States That Produce The Most Potatoes. The United States is amongst the top potato producers worldwide, and the states that produce the most potatoes in the country are Idaho, Washington, and Wisconsin. These states' hold in potato production results from their suitable climate, quality of soil, and well-established agricultural infrastructure. The demand from potato processing companies, restaurants, direct consumers, and export opportunities also influence the crop's profitability of farming in the main potato producing states in the US.As of 2023, the potato market continues to hold the position of a significant sector in the United States agriculture industry. According to a report published by the National Potato Council, the potato sector contributed $100 billion to the US economy. Out of the total contribution, $37.2 billion from producing (including $10.8 billion in farm production) and processing potato and potato products, and $63.7 billion from the crop's household consumption expenditure.Despite experiencing some fluctuations in recent years stemming from harsh weather conditions and changing dietary trends, potatoes remain a staple in the American diet and a crucial crop for many US farmers. The potato sector generates almost 0.714 million jobs in the country, of which, 0.4 million are directly employed in the potato supply chain while 0.3 million work in peripheral businesses. When put into the economic perspective, these jobs add around $53.5 billion to the country's GDP, as per the National Potato Council.Moreover, potato is the most consumed vegetable in the United States, with its annual per capita consumption ranging between 115 pounds to 120 pounds, as per the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center (AGMRC). In terms of market, US potato production's national farm gate value is $4.5 billion, and the dollar value of all potato products was $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The market's value chain includes everything from raw material production (farming) to processing and distribution to final consumers.Story continuesYou can also take a look at the 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to expand your knowledge of the world's main staple foods.Impact of the US Food Industry On Potato FarmingThe US fast food industry, in particular, is a major consumer of potatoes, especially in the form of French fries. Leading fast-food chains, such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Burger King, and Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), are significant buyers, with McDonald's alone consuming approximately 3.4 billion pounds of potatoes annually. A fast-food giant, Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), is known for its 'natural-cut' French fries and baked potatoes. They source their potatoes from local suppliers and contribute to the national potato sector. Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the few fast-food chains that offers baked potatoes on its menu. This healthier alternative to fries has been part of Wendy's menu since the early days and has remained a customer favorite.Potato chips are another major consumption sector, with companies like Frito-Lay (a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) being one of the largest consumers of US potatoes. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) owned Frito-Lay's other brands include Lay's, Ruffles, and Stax, which are all heavily reliant on potatoes as a primary ingredient. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) 's Frito-Lay operates over 30 manufacturing plants across the US and Canada.On the other side of the potato supply chain is Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW), a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products, particularly French fries. As of 2023, Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) operates 25 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, and China, making it one of the world's largest frozen potato companies serving domestic and international markets. Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) is also noted for its ongoing investment in research and development (R&amp;D), which leads to new product innovation. For instance, the company has been focusing on creating differentiated potato products, like its Crispy on Delivery fries, that can stay crispy for longer. Geographically, the bulk of potato farming is concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, with Idaho and Washington being the top potato producing states in the United States. In 2022, Idaho and Washington accounted for nearly 50% of the total US potato production because of their ideal growing conditions and mature supply chains.The U.S. is also a net exporter of potatoes; the country's key markets include Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico. According to the National Potato Council, frozen potatoes, particularly French fries, make up the lion's share of these exports. However, shifting dietary preferences towards lower-carbohydrate options has caused some decrease in potato consumption. In response, the potato industry has been driving efforts to promote the nutritional benefits of potatoes and introducing innovative, healthier potato-based products.Let's now proceed to know which states produce the most potatoes.20 States That Produce The Most Potatoes20 States That Produce The Most PotatoesOur Methodology To find 20 states that produce the most potatoes, we referred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Statistics Service. We narrowed down the broad database by selecting potato production by state in 2022. As the USDA database lists potato yield in cwt (hundredweight = 100 pounds), we rounded the figures into million cwt to simplify that stats. Notably, the USDA database doesn't have some states' latest potato production quantities, and we used the production quantity from 2018 for them to compile this thorough list. Based on the USDA stats, here are the top potato producing states in the United States:20. Virginia Potato Production in 2018: 1.034 million cwt Our list of states that produce the most potatoes starts with Virginia, as its Eastern Shore region has sandy loam soils and a favorable climate. Currently, Virginia's annual potato production in 2018 stood at 1.03 million hundredweight. These potatoes are primarily sold for fresh market use, with the Round White and Red potato varieties being the most popular. 19. Kansas Potato Production in 2018: 1.419 million cwt Although Kansas is better known for its wheat and corn production, it also has a sizable potato industry, largely based in the western part of the state where conditions suit tuber growth. The state of Kansas mainly grows russet-type potatoes intended for processing into products like fries and chips.18. Missouri Potato Production in 2018: 1.665 million cwt Missouri farmers predominantly cultivate white and russet potato varieties. They target the fresh market, although a portion of the harvest is processed into value-added products. The University of Missouri Extension provides crucial support to the potato industry through pest management and disease resistance research putting Missouri on the list of top states that produce the most potatoes.17. North Carolina Potato Production in 2018: 2.318 million cwt North Carolina's eastern region has a mild climate that provides a conducive environment for growth. The state produces mostly round white potatoes commercially harvested between May and July. According to USDA, the state's annual yield reached up to 2.3 million hundredweight in 2018.16. Illinois Potato Production in 2018: 2.850 million cwtIllinois has witnessed a steady rise in specialty potato crops. The Illinois State University's Horticulture Center has been instrumental in researching and promoting crop diversification. These efforts and the state's robust local food movement have opened up new markets for Illinois growers. Despite Illinois' corn and soybean dominance, potatoes have carved out a niche here and made it one of the top potato producing states in the United States. 15. Montana Potato Production in 2018: 3.885 million cwt Montana ranks amongst states that produce the most potatoes because of its high seed potato production. The state's relative isolation also limits crop exposure to diseases and offers growers a competitive advantage.14. New York Potato Production in 2018: 3.886 million cwt Potato production thrives in New York state's temperate climate and fertile soils, with a significant contribution from Long Island; it produced 3.886 million cwt of potatoes in 2018. New York potato farming is diversified, with many farmers growing table stock, processing varieties, and a significant share dedicated to the state's robust chipping industry. 13. Florida Potato Production in 2022: 4.956 million cwt Contrary to its subtropical reputation, Florida has early-season potatoes, which capitalize on the market before the larger northern states begin their harvest. As of 2022, Florida produces around 4.956 million hundredweight potatoes, predominantly in the northern and central regions of the state. Florida's farmers have also started experimenting with heat-tolerant potato varieties to adapt to the warming climate.12. Texas Potato Production in 2022: 7.188 million cwt While it's less prominent in Texas than other crops like cotton and corn, the state's potato production still accounts for nearly 7.188 million cwt. The High Plains and Rio Grande Valley regions are fertile for potato cultivation, where producers balance between russets for processing and reds for the fresh market. 11. California Potato Production in 2022: 7.728 million cwt 90% of California's potato production landscape is dedicated to specialty varieties such as red, yellow, and blue potatoes. A key feature of California's production is its year-round availability that facilitates the state's unique microclimates and innovative irrigation techniques. Their emphasis on diversity and consistent supply helps the state cater to niche markets, differentiating it from other major potato-producing states.10. Nebraska Potato Production in 2022: 9.55 million cwt Nebraska's potato production is characterized by its focus on commercial and processing potatoes. According to the USDA, Nebraska harvested around 15,500 acres of potatoes in 2020. The state's primary potato-growing regions, like the North Platte Valley, have developed smart irrigation systems that ensure consistent yields even during periods of drought.9.

The dividend yield will be 4.4% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Seagate Technology Holdings is not generating a profit, and despite this is paying out most of its free cash flow as a dividend. Paying a dividend while unprofitable is generally considered an aggressive policy, and with limited funds retained for reinvestment, growth may be slow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 54%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.28 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.1% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakySome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings per share has shrunk at 12% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesSeagate Technology Holdings' Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Reported EPS is $0.57, expectations were $0.13.Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newell Brands' Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief discussion by management, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. A live webcast of this call is available at ir.newellbrands.com. I will now turn the call over to Sofya Tsinis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Tsinis, you may begin.Sofya Tsinis: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newell Brands' second quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Peterson, our President and CEO; and Mark Erceg, our CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that during the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. I refer you to the cautionary language and risk factors available in our earnings release, our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other SEC filings available on our Investor Relations Web site for a further discussion of the factors affecting forward-looking statements.Please also recognize that today's remarks will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those referred to as normalized measures. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, although they should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Explanations of these non-GAAP measures and available reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's earnings release and tables that were furnished to the SEC. Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.Story continuesChris Peterson: Thank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. Second quarter results were in line with or ahead of our projections on all key metrics. As expected, top line results were pressured by normalizing category trends, constrained consumer spending on discretionary products and retailer inventory destocking. Operating margins, earnings per share and cash flow were all well ahead of expectations as we made meaningful progress on productivity initiatives and working capital reduction. While our results met or exceeded our expectations for the quarter, on an absolute basis, we aspire for significant improvement going forward. That is why we recently created and deployed a new corporate strategy based on a comprehensive companywide capability assessment with an integrated set of where to play and how to win choices.We're very excited about the clarity this work is bringing to the business and the value creation opportunity ahead of us. But we also recognize that the path forward will not be a straight line. During our first quarter earnings call, we laid out five key priorities for fiscal 2023 which are all progressing nicely. Let me say just a few words regarding each of them. First, starting with an operating cash flow. Year-to-date, we have driven a year-over-year improvement of over $700 million, largely by right sizing our inventory levels through improved forecasting and supply planning processes. Second, gross margin performance improved sequentially behind our ongoing fuel productivity program and Project Ovid which you will recall completely transformed Newell's domestic go-to-market operations.We are on track for a record high year on productivity savings across the supply chain. Third, Project Phoenix is simplifying and strengthening the organization by leveraging scale, reducing complexity, streamlining the operating model and driving operational efficiencies. The program is pacing well, and is on track to deliver $220 million to $250 million in pre-tax savings upon its full implementation. Fourth, our SKU count, which was over 100,000 as recently as five years ago, is expected to be down to less than 25,000 by the end of the year, with numerous other complexity reduction actions also underway. Finally, we have successfully transitioned to and are operating in a new operating model with three segments, centralized manufacturing and supply chain and on one Newell approach with our top four customers and across most geographies.It is from this much improved operational and organizational foundation that we made an important where to play choice to focus on and drive a disproportionate amount of our organizational and financial resources to our top 25 brands and our top 10 countries, which each represent about 90% of sales and profits. Once that decision was made, we turned our attention to our how to win choices, which were fully informed by the capability assessment we have just completed. That assessment clearly demonstrated the need for us to significantly improve our abilities in consumer and customer understanding, innovation, brand building, brand communication and retail execution. That's why when we revealed our new strategy in Paris last month we said we are making a major pivot in our frontend consumer facing capabilities to properly support leading brands in top countries.Since these how to win choices are cornerstone elements of the new integrated strategy, we have started to fill talent gaps across key areas and have established clear action plans and KPIs for each capability improvement project. For example, we are upgrading the company's ability to understand consumer and customer wants and needs. This should enable actionable insights around superior product development, leading to stronger claims in a more impactful and focused innovation pipeline as we concentrate on fewer, bigger and longer lasting innovations. In addition, we recently revamped Newell's innovation process, which will be underpinned by proprietary consumer insights. As part of this work, we designed and instituted a project tiering system and implemented an enterprise-wide biannual innovation process to sharpen the company's innovation plans, drive alignment on the funnel, and determine prioritization and resource allocation as we identify bigger bets.We also put in place a centralized tracking system for all new initiatives to enable multiyear technology platforms and ensure appropriate financial rigor to drive accretive margins. Relative to brand building and brand communication, we're building out a comprehensive brand management function, which was not in place previously. Going forward, Newell's brand managers and the multifunctional teams who support them will be responsible for profitably growing our top 25 brands in our top 10 countries alongside a newly redesigned brand communications governance process. Finally, as it relates to retail execution, our sales teams are leveraging the portfolio of Newell's leading brands and scale to actively pursue new distribution opportunities, which they've identified across every business, while also dramatically improving our sales fundamentals in existing accounts.Although it's still early days, I'm encouraged by the progress we were making in bringing the integrated set of where to play and how to win strategies to life. Importantly, these are not just corporate plans. They've been formally cascaded throughout the organization, informing the segment, functional and regional strategies where work is ongoing. Key members of the leadership team and I have visited six of our top 10 countries across Europe and Latin America in the last two months to ensure we are driving the strategy into execution. Now, before turning the call over to Mark who will discuss our financial results and outlook in detail, I want to address the revisions we have made to our top line estimates for the second half of the year. First, we are incrementally more cautious on the consumption of discretionary products, largely due to the resumption of student loan payments in October.As payments restart after a multiyear moratorium, many consumers will undoubtedly have to manage their budgets even tighter given persistently high core inflation, which has lowered real consumer income. Second, several of our major retail customers recently revised their shipping terms on our business, moving from what is known as direct import to domestic fulfillment. While we welcome this move, because we expect this change to be a positive for Newell longer term, it does put additional one-time pressure on back half shipments as their weeks of inventory coverage comes down further as a result of the transition. Lastly, we are now planning the baby business more conservatively in the back half of the year, due to the bankruptcy of Buybuy Baby.Up until now we assumed in our financial modeling that a buyer would emerge for most of their stores. Since that is no longer likely, we have adjusted our sales forecast accordingly. Revising our top line outlook and related demand plan now allows us to continue the strong progress we have made on inventory reduction, which is why we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance for the year. Additionally, we are taking bold actions to drive stronger productivity in the supply chain, which were made possible by a recent decision to consolidate our supply chain into a centralized organization structure. Specifically after benchmarking indirect overhead at each of Newell's key facilities, we are taking a series of discrete site specific actions to right size the company's manufacturing labor force.These decisions are never easy, but we are committed to building a one Newell optimized global manufacturing network that minimizes total landed cost, optimizes asset utilization and leverages Newell's global scale. Moving forward, we are assessing how to optimize the company's entire plant network as we look to transition to more regionalized multi-source plants with upgraded automation and digitization capabilities, where appropriate. We will, of course, share more of the relevant details as plans are finalized. These top line revisions notwithstanding, we remain optimistic on the back-to-school season, which kicks into full gear in the coming weeks. And we continue to expect much stronger performance for the company in the back half relative to the first half of the year.Photo by NeONBRAND on UnsplashThe pace of change has accelerated across the company and we are moving with speed and agility to unlock the full potential of the enterprise. On a personal note, I would like to thank Newell's employees for welcoming me as their new CEO and for their strong endorsement of the new company strategy. At its core, our new strategy focuses on improving the company's consumer-facing capabilities, while distorting investment to the most attractive value pools and simultaneously building upon the strengthened operational and organizational foundation we have built over the past several years. Their unwavering commitment to our purpose of delighting consumers by lighting up everyday moments inspires me every day. We have plenty of work ahead, but I sincerely believe we are off to a great start.While we continue to navigate through a challenging macroeconomic backdrop in the near term, I remain confident in our ability to accelerate the company's financial performance over the long term. I will now hand the call over to Mark.Mark Erceg: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated earlier, our Q2 results continue to reflect the significant macro-driven top line pressures we have been contending with since the third quarter of last year, namely soft consumer demand as inflation continued to put pressure on discretionary spending and subcategories continue to normalize, along with trade inventory destocking and the bankruptcy of a major retailer. Thus, while the 13% contraction in net sales of $2.2 billion and the 11.9% decline in core sales might on the surface be discouraging, we believe a more thorough examination shows the interventions we have made to improve the underlying structural economics of the business and strengthen operating cash flow are working as intended.For example, normalized gross margin and operating margin both improved sequentially due to enhanced productivity efforts and Project Phoenix savings, which were critical in helping mitigate the significant 400 basis point headwind during the quarter from inflation. Nonetheless, Newell's normalized operating margin contracted 490 basis points versus last year to 9.1% as normalized gross margin declined 320 basis points versus last year to 29.9%. And top line softness resulted in 160 basis point increase in the normalized SG&amp;A sales ratio. In addition, during the second quarter, net interest expense did increase $21 million to $76 million, reflecting overall higher debt and interest rates versus year ago, but the decision to right size the dividend in a nearly $700 million year-over-year reduction in inventory allowed us to lower debt levels versus last quarter by nearly $300 million.Our effective normalized tax rate of 13.7% was slightly below a year ago, which when combined with the other elements we just reviewed, brought normalized diluted earnings per share in at $0.24, which was considerably better than the $0.10 to $0.18 outlook we had previously provided. Turning to operating cash flow, the planning team did a great job managing inventory levels down while increasing fill rates, which in North America improved to 94% year-to-date from 82% last year. This allowed us to generate $277 million of positive operating cash flow year-to-date through the second quarter. Importantly, this stands in stark contrast to a $450 million use of cash during the same period last year. Therefore, through the first six months of 2023, operating cash flow improved by more than $700 million and encouragingly in transit inventory as of June 30 was approximately $275 million below year-ago levels, so we are confident inventory levels will be even lower throughout the balance of the year.The company's leverage increased to 6.3x at the end of Q2, which was nearly one full turn better than anticipated. We believe leverage has peaked and expect it to drop to approximately 5x by the end of the year. Our long-term goal was to reach leverage at 2.5x. As we look towards the balance of the year, Chris laid out the incremental top line pressures we are facing, so I will not reiterate them. However, it does bear mentioning that this additional sales compression, coupled with our decision to lower inventory balances even further, does create a short-term fixed cost absorption challenge. Although we are aggressively optimizing the company's manufacturing labor force within the confines of our existing planned network, fixed costs deleveraging will still weigh on our second half gross and operating margins.Second half operating margin will also be impacted by our decision to invest in capability building and brand support to implement and accelerate critical aspects of our new corporate strategy. Given that context, we've assumed the following for the third quarter. Net sales of $2.11 billion to $2.16 billion with core sales down 7% to 5%. Traditionally, we do not respectively comment on gross margin. But in this instance, we think it's important to point out third quarter normalized gross margin is expected to represent an inflection point as strong productivity gains inclusive of our simplification efforts and July 1 pricing activity across roughly 30% of our U.S. business, primarily in the home and commercial solutions segment, are only partially offset by inflation and fixed cost absorption.We expect SG&amp;A to be higher on a year-over-year basis in both dollar terms and as a percentage of sales as we increase brand support and invest in frontend capabilities such as consumer and customer understanding, revenue growth management, data analytics and retail execution, among others. Parenthetically, last year's third quarter SG&amp;A was favorably impacted by a meaningful drop in management compensation accruals. Third quarter normalized operating margin is expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.4%. While this is admittedly down versus last year, the rate of decline is expected to ease relative to both Q2 and the first half as the structural economics of the business should continue to improve. We forecast interest expense to be substantially higher year-over-year and expect a mid-teens tax rate.All-in, we're guiding to normalize third quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.20 to $0.24. For the full year, we expect net sales of $8.2 billion to $8.34 billion, driven by core sales decline of 12% to 10%. Normalized operating margin is expected to be 7.8% to 8.2% as we reflect the negative top line flow through and incremental capability investments discussed earlier. Interest expense is forecast to be up slightly versus year ago and the tax team has done some terrific planning work, which should create a sizable tax benefit in the fourth quarter. Assuming that benefit is realized, the full year normalized effective tax rate is expected to be close to zero. Normalized diluted earnings per share are now expected to be $0.80 to $0.90.Relative to cash, which was our number one priority this year, we continue to anticipate $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow, inclusive of $95 million to $120 million of cash payments related to Project Phoenix, which remains on track to realize $140 million to $160 million of pre-tax savings this year. The midpoint of our operating cash flow range implies operating cash flow will improve by more than $1 billion year-over-year with free cash flow productivity comfortably above 100%. So with all that said, let's summarize the key takeaways from today's call. First, top line pressures are expected to persist throughout the balance of the year. But as core inflation moderates, trade destocking slows and we cycle against easier comps, we anticipate that our top line results will improve on a relative basis.Second, we believe the underlying structural economics of the business will improve in the back half behind significant interventions across all facets of the business. In fact, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect second half normalized operating margin to expand over 200 basis points versus year ago, and more than 350 basis points versus the first half of this year. Frankly, this would be a good outcome. Since again, using the midpoint of our range, full year net sales are expected to be down approximately $1.2 billion versus last year. Moreover, since we expect inventory to drop by approximately 25% year-over-year and the July 1 price increase that negatively impacted unit volume, one could reasonably assume production volumes will be down this year by 20% to 25%.Thus, the amount of cost takeout required to hold Newell's gross margin flat, let alone expanded, against this backdrop is not inconsequential and should provide significant positive financial leverage once the macroeconomic environment stabilizes and we begin to see the benefits of the major pivot we are making in our frontend consumer-facing capabilities. Third, the year-over-year increase in operating cash flow is expected to be at least $1 billion, which speaks for itself. Finally, we now have a unified corporate strategy based on a comprehensive companywide capability assessment with very clear where to play and how to win choices. We believe strongly in the strategy and are investing behind it as we move with deliberate speed to unlock the full potential of Newell's portfolio of leading brands.Operator, if you could, please open the call to questions.See also 25 Countries with the Highest Income Inequality in the World and 13 Safe Stocks To Invest In.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Now, I'll turn it over to Rob.Rob Sharps: Thank you, Linsley, and thank you all for joining us today. While equity outflows continued in the second quarter, we saw improved performance in a number of important investment strategies. Stronger equity markets helped lift revenue from first quarter levels, and we identified substantial cost savings that will allow us to meaningfully slow expense growth while continuing to pursue our strategic initiatives. On today's call, I'll give an overview of our investment performance followed by a brief update on the key milestones we've reached in advancing our strategic initiatives. Jen will then provide a detailed view of our financial results before we take your questions. Overall, second quarter investment performance was encouraging with reasonably solid results across asset classes and the percentage of funds outperforming their peers increasing from the prior quarter.Story continuesThe U.S. large-cap growth franchise outperformed this quarter, with blue chip growth stock and large-cap growth posting top-quartile results versus peers and beating their benchmarks. Our U.S. equity research and mid-cap value strategies continued to deliver strong performance. In contrast, the large-cap value franchise, a bright spot in 2022, gave back some of its relative outperformance in the first half of 2023. However, the long-term results remain favorable. Our target date franchise delivered another strong quarter of performance with all of our flagship retirement funds ranking in the top quartile. Performance in fixed income and international equity was solid as well, with the majority of funds in both segments outperforming peer groups and a number of products, including global multisector bond and U.S. high yield, in the top decile for the quarter.Our global stock, overseas stock and several of our municipal bond strategies were top-quartile performers in the second quarter and all have strong three-, five- and 10-year performance track records. Despite these gains, organic growth remains under pressure. As we reported, net outflows for the second quarter were $20 billion. The sales and redemption patterns that we saw in the first quarter largely continued in the second. U.S. equity outflows were primarily driven by U.S. large-cap growth strategies as market demand remained muted and we saw the lagging impact of past investment performance on sales and redemptions. International and global outflows slowed with improved market demand and better performance. Fixed income net flows declined from the prior quarter as rates rose and demand softened.Target date products had net inflows of $2.4 billion for the quarter. To protect our ability to invest in our corporate strategy and deliver for our clients, we are proactively managing expense growth. We are pursuing a number of efforts to manage expenses, drive efficiency and create a cost structure that's appropriate for the size and scale of our firm today. Jen will discuss these efforts in greater detail, but since the fourth quarter of 2022, we have taken steps to remove or reallocate over $200 million in run rate costs for 2024. This work partly reflects ongoing company and industry challenges, but also reflects a broader commitment to efficiency, process improvement and durability, driving a culture of continuous improvement in innovation with an agile mindset.Institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver for our clients even in challenging times. Our corporate strategy is focused on areas where we believe we have the greatest opportunity for growth and long-term success. In the second quarter, we advanced efforts to deepen our client partnerships, expand our investment in operational capabilities, and continued to broaden our global reach. We've made important hires and met some key milestones. We are making steady progress in bolstering our USI Wealth channel by fortifying partnerships with the largest intermediary firms in the industry. Clients expect compelling investment strategies offered in a variety of vehicles to meet their needs, and we made progress delivering on both this quarter.On June 15, we launched five fully-transparent active equity ETFs, which are already generating client interest and inflows. Our existing lineup of 15 ETFs now at $1.5 billion in AUM is steadily building momentum. We continue to fill out our roster of SMA strategies with the addition of four muni and two equity SMA strategies this quarter. We finalized the seed commitment for our first joint co-branded product with OHA, T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCredit, and closed for our business development company, or BDC, election filing on June 30. The filing is a key legal milestone for the launch, which is planned for later this year. We also hired a Head of U.S. Intermediary Alternative Sales and we'll continue to invest in resources and expertise to support this effort.We closed on our acquisition of Retiree, Inc., which will enhance our ability to expand and retain relationships with pre-retiree and retiree clients by providing tax aware retirement income and social security claiming strategies. With this acquisition, we demonstrate our commitment to expanding and evolving our already strong retirement capabilities. So, while our flows continue to reflect lingering challenges, we are making clear progress. Our work on driving efficiencies and managing expenses will allow us to continue to invest to deliver for our clients and support future growth. I'm impressed by the resiliency and commitment of our associates and I remain confident in the long-term fundamental value that a global active investment management firm like T.Rowe Price can deliver no matter the environment. I'll now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for the second quarter.trade, deal, investor, background, partnership, money, forex, capital, market, bar, business, night, fingers, diagram, cooperation, finance, data, stock, analysis, bank, report,ZIDO SUN/Shutterstock.comJen Dardis: Thank you, Rob, and hello everyone. I will begin today by reviewing our financial results and will provide additional detail on our expense management efforts before we open the line for questions. As reported, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.02 for Q2 2023 versus $1.69 in Q1 2023, an increase from both higher revenues and carefully managed expense growth. Q2 2023 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower quarterly effective tax rate. We ended the quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM, an increase of $58 billion from March 31, 2023, driven by market appreciation and partially offset by net outflows. Our average assets for the quarter were $1.36 trillion, up from Q1 2023, but down almost $50 billion from Q2 2022.As Rob mentioned, we posted $20 billion in net outflows for the quarter. Across the entire complex, we continue to see clients taking longer to make decisions based on current market volatility, which is resulting in lower sales and net inflows than we've seen in prior years. Industry-wide, active equity and fixed income fund flows have been muted for over a year. We expect that this slowdown is cyclical and will revert to more normal patterns as the direction of interest rates, inflation and the likelihood of a recession become clearer. Also consistent with last quarter, our U.S. large-cap growth equity products drove a majority of the outflows, and we are seeing performance-related lower sales and elevated redemptions from a range of clients.It will take some time for the recent performance improvement in these products to slow the outflows. Positive inflows for the quarter included U.S. equity research, capital appreciation, international core and all-cap opportunities. We also had net inflows to international fixed income, driven by Global Investment Grade, Global Multisector and Euro Corporate Bond. However, the inflows to international fixed income were more than offset by outflows from our U.S. fixed income stable value and floating rate products. Our target date net inflows were $2.4 billion for the quarter. While this was down from Q1, keep in mind that first quarter flows are typically the strongest given that a higher proportion of planned decisions happen around year-end.In the first half of the year, we recorded $9.9 billion of net inflows to our target date products. In response to changing market conditions and more available capacity, we have reopened to new investors, some of our previously closed products, including mid-cap growth, small-cap growth and emerging market equity, which we expect will support future sales and net flows. We also continue to evaluate the capacity levels for other closed strategies, and we'll consider reopening these in the future. Our Q2 adjusted net revenues were $1.6 billion, including $1.4 billion of investment advisory revenue, that was up from Q1 2023 on equity market gains. Our effective fee rate was 42.3 basis points, back to the same level it was in Q4 2022 after a slight uptick in the first quarter of 2023.Our adjusted operating expenses were a little over $1 billion, which was generally flat to the first quarter of this year, but up 8.3% from the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year change was largely driven by the change in capital allocation-based income related compensation. As a reminder, in second quarter last year, there was negative capital allocation-based income, which created an expense offset. Excluding the compensation expense related to capital allocation-based income, adjusted operating expenses were up 1.8% over the same period last year, with compensation and related costs up less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to forecast our 2023 adjusted operating expense growth, excluding capital allocation-based income related compensation expense, will be in the range of 2% to 6% over the comparable full year 2022 amount of $4.1 billion.Based on current market conditions, we still expect to land at or below the midpoint of this range. As Rob mentioned, we are pursuing a number of efforts to proactively manage our expense growth and drive efficiency. Last week, we internally communicated the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 2% of our existing positions globally. We have also slowed the pace of hiring and headcount growth by closing select open positions across the firm. All of these actions have been based on a careful review to make sure we are aligning our resources to best support our clients and drive long-term growth for the firm. Based on our current pace of hiring against our strategic initiatives, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 to be modestly higher than the start of the year, even with the reductions I just mentioned.Most of the costs related to the recent reduction in force will be incurred in the third quarter and are already included in our expense guidance. As we move forward, we remain committed to finding ways to be more efficient and drive a culture of continuous improvement. For example, we are evaluating our current real estate use in light of our new hybrid work approach, with the objective of slowing our occupancy and facilities expense growth. It will be some time, however, before any impact to expenses from real estate would be realized. In total, between the expense efforts we took last year and this year, we will have removed or reallocated over $200 million in operating expenses versus the run rate for 2024. This financial discipline will allow us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives to support future growth, while positioning us for low-single digit adjusted operating expense growth in 2024, excluding the impact of capital allocation-based income related compensation.We will refine these estimates as we get closer to year-end. As always, this estimate is based on current market levels and we could choose to adjust it if markets rise or fall significantly. Shifting to capital management, we found some buying opportunities in May and June, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to over 420,000 shares at an average price of just over $107 per share for $45 million in total. We remain opportunistic in our approach to buybacks. However, given continued market uncertainty, we are being patient in the process. Supporting our recurring dividend remains a top priority, and in the first half of 2023, we returned over $600 million to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to support both our seed capital program and potential M&amp;A.We are confident in the efforts we've identified to drive efficiency and slow our expense growth, as we continue to manage the business to support our clients and return the firm to organic growth over time. As Rob said, institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver value for our clients even in challenging times. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&amp;A.See also 20 Best AI Chrome Extensions for 2023 and 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on United Parcel Service is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$13b ÷ (US$72b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 23%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for United Parcel Service.How Are Returns Trending?It's hard not to be impressed by United Parcel Service's returns on capital. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 23% and the business has deployed 68% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 84% return if they held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for United Parcel Service  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Pentair's (NYSE:PNR) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Pentair, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$787m ÷ (US$6.5b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Pentair has an ROCE of 14%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Machinery industry. View our latest analysis for Pentair roceIn the above chart we have measured Pentair's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Pentair here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 14% and the business has deployed 76% more capital into its operations. 14% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Pentair has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.The Key TakeawayTo sum it up, Pentair has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 72% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesPentair does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Pentair  that you might be interested in.While Pentair may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

This means that the annual payment will be 2.1% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Capital One Financial Capital One Financial's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible.Capital One Financial has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Using data from its latest earnings report, Capital One Financial's payout ratio sits at 18%, an extremely comfortable number that shows that it can pay its dividend.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 16.4%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 17% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.20 total annually to $2.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 28% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Capital One Financial has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 14% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Capital One Financial's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Capital One Financial Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:24% = US$3.0b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.24.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.LyondellBasell Industries' Earnings Growth And 24% ROETo begin with, LyondellBasell Industries has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As you might expect, the 2.5% net income decline reported by LyondellBasell Industries doesn't bode well with us. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesHowever, when we compared LyondellBasell Industries' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 14% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is LYB worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether LYB is currently mispriced by the market.Is LyondellBasell Industries Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 40% (or a retention ratio of 60%) which is pretty normal, LyondellBasell Industries' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 44%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that LyondellBasell Industries' future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like LyondellBasell Industries has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Cincinnati Financial's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cincinnati Financial is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cincinnati Financial's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Cincinnati Financial's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 10%. Despite this, Cincinnati Financial's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesWe then compared Cincinnati Financial's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 11% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Cincinnati Financial fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Cincinnati Financial Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Cincinnati Financial has a low three-year median payout ratio of 20% (or a retention ratio of 80%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.Moreover, Cincinnati Financial has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.SummaryOverall, we feel that Cincinnati Financial certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business.

87,3aa412a0-7ce1-41dc-913d-c09a769c9e9e,GE,2023-07-30,GE stock surge shows it's possible to turn around a legacy company,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-stock-surge-shows-its-possible-to-turn-around-a-legacy-company-173000032.html,1690651800,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE', '^DJI']","[It’s hard to turn a legacy company around. In the case of over 125-year-old GE (GE), some would say near impossible.Yet the industrial giant is less than a year away from achieving a multiyear turnaround plan that transforms what was once an iconic but sprawling conglomerate into an aerospace-focused company. Its slimming down has Wall Street excited.Management's ""focus on cash flow, cleaning up the balance sheet, selling off assets, [and] paying down debt,"" is why the stock has recently hit 52-week highs, Argus analyst John Eade told Yahoo Finance.The stock is up 100% over the past year, and 72% higher since the start of 2023.Shares rose 6% this past Tuesday after the company “crushed” second-quarter earnings estimates, as noted by another analyst, Morningstar's Joshua Aguilar.“GE has world class assets, exceptional leadership, and is turning around its businesses,” Aguilar told Yahoo Finance.The Boston-based industrial raised its full year guidance after posting a beat on the top and bottom line. Profit margin grew 160 basis points in the second quarter.“In the first half alone, earnings have now surpassed our full-year 2022 results,” GE's chief executive officer Larry Culp said during the company’s earnings call.It's been nearly five years since Culp took the helm of GE with the purpose of sorting out a multinational conglomerate that had been going through years of turmoil.“He was saddled with so much debt or obligations…That’s like doing ballet wearing heavy weights around your ankles,” Columbia Business School Professor Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, a specialist in corporate strategy and turnarounds told Yahoo Finance.Harrigan highlights hundreds of acquisitions over a span of two decades under former CEO Jack Welch and his successor Jeff Immelt, whose tenure lasted 16 years. The conglomerate's portfolio mix at one point or another included lighting, home appliances, plastics, aircraft engines, medical equipment, financial services, water treatment, and even television stations.Story continues""They grew too large under their previous management teams,"" said Argus' Eade. ""Their businesses didn't offer a lot of synergies to their other businesses.""""They were not focused very closely in any one direction. Toward the end, I believe they overpaid for some assets, and that stretched their balance sheet. And then they ran into regulatory issues as well related to the financial crisis. So they had problems coming from a number of angles,"" he added.In June 2018, GE was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), after more than 100 years on the elite index. Shares that year had fallen more than 35% after sinking 47% in 2017.In October 2018, Culp was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of GE, following veteran John Flannery's CEO tenure of just 14 months.Culp was ""an outside CEO with an objective view of what to do with GE’s portfolio,"" said Morningstar’s Aguilar.Through restructuring and asset sales, including the sale of its historic lighting business, GE has reduced debt by more than $100 billion since 2018.General Electric logo is seen through magnifier in front of displayed Aviation, Energy, Healthcare words in this illustration taken, November 9, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration (Dado Ruvic / reuters)In November 2021, Culp announced a plan long speculated about on Wall Street, to split GE into three different companies, focused on aviation, healthcare, and energy.GE HealthCare was spun off and began trading on the Nasdaq in January 2023. Its renewable energy and power unit, rebranded GE Vernova, is expected to spin off in the first quarter of 2024.Once the split occurs, GE will be focused on its aviation business, called GE Aerospace. In the company's latest quarter, aerospace revenue rose 28% and orders increased 37% while profit jumped by almost 30% year-over-year.General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp mingles with shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in Tarrytown, N.Y, on May 8, 2019.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Valero Energy's shares on or after the 2nd of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.02 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.08 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Valero Energy has a trailing yield of 3.2% on the current share price of $129.07. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Valero Energy is paying out just 14% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Valero Energy generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 16% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Valero Energy has grown its earnings rapidly, up 27% a year for the past five years. Valero Energy looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Valero Energy has delivered 19% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Valero Energy worth buying for its dividend? We love that Valero Energy is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while Valero Energy looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Valero Energy and understanding them should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Fast Is UnitedHealth Group Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years UnitedHealth Group grew its EPS by 7.9% per year. While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our analysis has highlighted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. UnitedHealth Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$349b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for UnitedHealth Group.Are UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since UnitedHealth Group has a market capitalisation of US$468b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.6b. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of UnitedHealth Group but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add UnitedHealth Group To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with UnitedHealth Group , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

90,eeeada08-fde5-3b00-ad84-f0abefad13ea,EL,2023-07-30,Is The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Worth US$180 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-130022105.html,1690635622,STORY,['EL'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Estée Lauder Companies is US$140 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityEstée Lauder Companies is estimated to be 29% overvalued based on current share price of US$180 Analyst price target for EL is US$226, which is 62% above our fair value estimateHow far off is The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.04bUS$2.49bUS$2.88bUS$3.18bUS$3.43bUS$3.61bUS$3.77bUS$3.91bUS$4.04bUS$4.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$1.9kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$66bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$66b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$29bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$50b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$180, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.081. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Estée Lauder CompaniesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Personal Products market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Eaton investors that purchase the stock on or after the 4th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.86 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.44 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Eaton has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of $203.3. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Eaton paid out 51% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 59% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Eaton's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Eaton's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Eaton has delivered 8.5% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Eaton? While earnings per share are flat, at least Eaton has not committed itself to an unsustainable dividend, with its earnings and cashflow payout ratios within reasonable bounds. Bottom line: Eaton has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.Although, if you're still interested in Eaton and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Eaton you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our analysis of potato production and consumption trends in the country, read 8 States That Produce The Most Potatoes. The United States is amongst the top potato producers worldwide, and the states that produce the most potatoes in the country are Idaho, Washington, and Wisconsin. These states' hold in potato production results from their suitable climate, quality of soil, and well-established agricultural infrastructure. The demand from potato processing companies, restaurants, direct consumers, and export opportunities also influence the crop's profitability of farming in the main potato producing states in the US.As of 2023, the potato market continues to hold the position of a significant sector in the United States agriculture industry. According to a report published by the National Potato Council, the potato sector contributed $100 billion to the US economy. Out of the total contribution, $37.2 billion from producing (including $10.8 billion in farm production) and processing potato and potato products, and $63.7 billion from the crop's household consumption expenditure.Despite experiencing some fluctuations in recent years stemming from harsh weather conditions and changing dietary trends, potatoes remain a staple in the American diet and a crucial crop for many US farmers. The potato sector generates almost 0.714 million jobs in the country, of which, 0.4 million are directly employed in the potato supply chain while 0.3 million work in peripheral businesses. When put into the economic perspective, these jobs add around $53.5 billion to the country's GDP, as per the National Potato Council.Moreover, potato is the most consumed vegetable in the United States, with its annual per capita consumption ranging between 115 pounds to 120 pounds, as per the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center (AGMRC). In terms of market, US potato production's national farm gate value is $4.5 billion, and the dollar value of all potato products was $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The market's value chain includes everything from raw material production (farming) to processing and distribution to final consumers.Story continuesYou can also take a look at the 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to expand your knowledge of the world's main staple foods.Impact of the US Food Industry On Potato FarmingThe US fast food industry, in particular, is a major consumer of potatoes, especially in the form of French fries. Leading fast-food chains, such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Burger King, and Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), are significant buyers, with McDonald's alone consuming approximately 3.4 billion pounds of potatoes annually. A fast-food giant, Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), is known for its 'natural-cut' French fries and baked potatoes. They source their potatoes from local suppliers and contribute to the national potato sector. Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the few fast-food chains that offers baked potatoes on its menu. This healthier alternative to fries has been part of Wendy's menu since the early days and has remained a customer favorite.Potato chips are another major consumption sector, with companies like Frito-Lay (a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) being one of the largest consumers of US potatoes. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) owned Frito-Lay's other brands include Lay's, Ruffles, and Stax, which are all heavily reliant on potatoes as a primary ingredient. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) 's Frito-Lay operates over 30 manufacturing plants across the US and Canada.On the other side of the potato supply chain is Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW), a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products, particularly French fries. As of 2023, Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) operates 25 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, and China, making it one of the world's largest frozen potato companies serving domestic and international markets. Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) is also noted for its ongoing investment in research and development (R&amp;D), which leads to new product innovation. For instance, the company has been focusing on creating differentiated potato products, like its Crispy on Delivery fries, that can stay crispy for longer. Geographically, the bulk of potato farming is concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, with Idaho and Washington being the top potato producing states in the United States. In 2022, Idaho and Washington accounted for nearly 50% of the total US potato production because of their ideal growing conditions and mature supply chains.The U.S. is also a net exporter of potatoes; the country's key markets include Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico. According to the National Potato Council, frozen potatoes, particularly French fries, make up the lion's share of these exports. However, shifting dietary preferences towards lower-carbohydrate options has caused some decrease in potato consumption. In response, the potato industry has been driving efforts to promote the nutritional benefits of potatoes and introducing innovative, healthier potato-based products.Let's now proceed to know which states produce the most potatoes.20 States That Produce The Most Potatoes20 States That Produce The Most PotatoesOur Methodology To find 20 states that produce the most potatoes, we referred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Statistics Service. We narrowed down the broad database by selecting potato production by state in 2022. As the USDA database lists potato yield in cwt (hundredweight = 100 pounds), we rounded the figures into million cwt to simplify that stats. Notably, the USDA database doesn't have some states' latest potato production quantities, and we used the production quantity from 2018 for them to compile this thorough list. Based on the USDA stats, here are the top potato producing states in the United States:20. Virginia Potato Production in 2018: 1.034 million cwt Our list of states that produce the most potatoes starts with Virginia, as its Eastern Shore region has sandy loam soils and a favorable climate. Currently, Virginia's annual potato production in 2018 stood at 1.03 million hundredweight. These potatoes are primarily sold for fresh market use, with the Round White and Red potato varieties being the most popular. 19. Kansas Potato Production in 2018: 1.419 million cwt Although Kansas is better known for its wheat and corn production, it also has a sizable potato industry, largely based in the western part of the state where conditions suit tuber growth. The state of Kansas mainly grows russet-type potatoes intended for processing into products like fries and chips.18. Missouri Potato Production in 2018: 1.665 million cwt Missouri farmers predominantly cultivate white and russet potato varieties. They target the fresh market, although a portion of the harvest is processed into value-added products. The University of Missouri Extension provides crucial support to the potato industry through pest management and disease resistance research putting Missouri on the list of top states that produce the most potatoes.17. North Carolina Potato Production in 2018: 2.318 million cwt North Carolina's eastern region has a mild climate that provides a conducive environment for growth. The state produces mostly round white potatoes commercially harvested between May and July. According to USDA, the state's annual yield reached up to 2.3 million hundredweight in 2018.16. Illinois Potato Production in 2018: 2.850 million cwtIllinois has witnessed a steady rise in specialty potato crops. The Illinois State University's Horticulture Center has been instrumental in researching and promoting crop diversification. These efforts and the state's robust local food movement have opened up new markets for Illinois growers. Despite Illinois' corn and soybean dominance, potatoes have carved out a niche here and made it one of the top potato producing states in the United States. 15. Montana Potato Production in 2018: 3.885 million cwt Montana ranks amongst states that produce the most potatoes because of its high seed potato production. The state's relative isolation also limits crop exposure to diseases and offers growers a competitive advantage.14. New York Potato Production in 2018: 3.886 million cwt Potato production thrives in New York state's temperate climate and fertile soils, with a significant contribution from Long Island; it produced 3.886 million cwt of potatoes in 2018. New York potato farming is diversified, with many farmers growing table stock, processing varieties, and a significant share dedicated to the state's robust chipping industry. 13. Florida Potato Production in 2022: 4.956 million cwt Contrary to its subtropical reputation, Florida has early-season potatoes, which capitalize on the market before the larger northern states begin their harvest. As of 2022, Florida produces around 4.956 million hundredweight potatoes, predominantly in the northern and central regions of the state. Florida's farmers have also started experimenting with heat-tolerant potato varieties to adapt to the warming climate.12. Texas Potato Production in 2022: 7.188 million cwt While it's less prominent in Texas than other crops like cotton and corn, the state's potato production still accounts for nearly 7.188 million cwt. The High Plains and Rio Grande Valley regions are fertile for potato cultivation, where producers balance between russets for processing and reds for the fresh market. 11. California Potato Production in 2022: 7.728 million cwt 90% of California's potato production landscape is dedicated to specialty varieties such as red, yellow, and blue potatoes. A key feature of California's production is its year-round availability that facilitates the state's unique microclimates and innovative irrigation techniques. Their emphasis on diversity and consistent supply helps the state cater to niche markets, differentiating it from other major potato-producing states.10. Nebraska Potato Production in 2022: 9.55 million cwt Nebraska's potato production is characterized by its focus on commercial and processing potatoes. According to the USDA, Nebraska harvested around 15,500 acres of potatoes in 2020. The state's primary potato-growing regions, like the North Platte Valley, have developed smart irrigation systems that ensure consistent yields even during periods of drought.9. Michigan Potato Production in 2022: 16.465 million cwt In Michigan, potato is harvested over 47,000 acres; consequently, it is amongst the states that produce the most potatoes. The state's specialty in chipping potatoes is due to a particular climate that features cold winters and moderate summers, which provides optimal conditions for growing potatoes with low sugar content, ideal for chipping. Click to continue reading and see 8 States That Produce The Most Potatoes.Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Potato Chip Brands and Companies in the World16 Biggest Fast Food Companies in the World10 Largest Fast Food Chains In the WorldDisclosure: None. 20 States That Produce The Most Potatoes is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the first presentation of positive two-year (96 weeks) results from the pivotal PHOTON trial investigating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens, compared to EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). The results were presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) annual meeting.“At two years, the PHOTON trial demonstrates the substantial impact aflibercept 8 mg could have in reducing treatment burden for patients with diabetic macular edema,” said Diana V. Do, MD, Professor of Ophthalmology and Vice Chair for Clinical Affairs at the Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University and a trial investigator. “Maintaining two years of vision and anatomic improvements with as few as three or four injections per year, while not compromising safety, is impressive and could make a meaningful difference in the lives of the patients we treat.”PHOTON (N=658) is a double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trial evaluating non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg extended dosing intervals compared to EYLEA. Patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg were initially randomized to either 12- (n=328) or 16-week (n=163) dosing intervals (after three initial monthly doses) compared to an 8-week dosing regimen for EYLEA (n=167) after five initial monthly doses. During the trial, patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Patients were only able to extend their dosing intervals in the second year by 4-week increments up to 24-weeks, if pre-specified criteria were met.Story continuesThe PHOTON trial met its primary endpoint last year with aflibercept 8 mg patients achieving clinically equivalent vision gains to EYLEA, with approximately 90% maintaining 12- and 16-week dosing regimens through the first year. Through two years, the mean number of injections administered were 9.5 for the 12-week aflibercept 8 mg group, 7.8 for the 16-week aflibercept 8 mg group, and 13.8 for the EYLEA group, with the vast majority of aflibercept 8 mg patients maintaining extended dosing intervals as first shared in June 2023:89% of patients maintained ≥12-week dosing intervals, compared to 93% through one year84% maintained ≥16-week dosing intervals, compared to 89% maintaining a 16-week dosing interval through one year, among those randomized at baseline to a 16-week dosing interval44% met the criteria for ≥20-week dosing intervals at week 96, including 17% and 27% who were eligible for 20- and 24-week dosing intervals, respectivelyThe safety of aflibercept 8 mg continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for DME. Ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurring in 5% of patients in any treatment group, in decreasing frequency, were cataract, vitreous floaters and conjunctival hemorrhage. There were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis. The rate of intraocular inflammation was 1.2% for both the EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg groups. Anti-platelet trialists' collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic TEAEs occurred in 7.2% of patients treated with EYLEA and 6.7% of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg.The full ASRS presentation is available on the Regeneron website. The two-year data from the pivotal PULSAR trial for aflibercept 8 mg in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) are expected in the third quarter of 2023.Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG, with Regeneron sponsoring the PHOTON trial. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg following any regulatory approvals.About the Aflibercept 8 mg Clinical Trial Program PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. During the trial, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.About DMEDME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.About Ophthalmology at RegeneronAt Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 64 million EYLEA injections globally.Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes aflibercept 8 mg, which is being developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg [0.01 mL]).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NYSE:AMP) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-ameriprise-financial-inc-120249669.html,1690718569,STORY,['AMP'],"[It looks like Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Ameriprise Financial's shares on or after the 4th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 18th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.35 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.40 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Ameriprise Financial has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of $345.21. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Ameriprise Financial paid out just 24% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, Ameriprise Financial's earnings per share have been growing at 18% a year for the past five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Ameriprise Financial has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Ameriprise Financial? Companies like Ameriprise Financial that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Ameriprise Financial more closely.In light of that, while Ameriprise Financial has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

95,c41c15a8-1d21-3429-9143-1af461954ef9,CSCO,2023-07-30,"Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-110124116.html,1690714884,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 10% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Cisco Systems'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:27% = US$11b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.27 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Cisco Systems has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Cisco Systems was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Cisco Systems' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 37% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is CSCO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CSCO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Cisco Systems Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?While Cisco Systems has a three-year median payout ratio of 55% (which means it retains 45% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Cisco Systems has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 39% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Cisco Systems' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 33%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Cisco Systems has some positive attributes. Its earnings growth is decent, and the high ROE does contribute to that growth. However, investors could have benefitted even more from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?
