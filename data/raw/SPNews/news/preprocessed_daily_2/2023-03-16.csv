1,0fa65cfd-4804-311c-9571-19b013f4357b,SCHW,2023-03-16,The total return for Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-charles-schwab-nyse-120036138.html,1678968036,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have seen the share price descend 26% over the month. But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 87% during that period.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 10%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Charles Schwab was able to grow its EPS at 10% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Charles Schwab the TSR over the last 3 years was 95%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 12% in the twelve months, Charles Schwab shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors.

It has amassed assets over $14 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap BlendThere's a lot of potential to investing in small cap companies, but with market capitalization below $2 billion, that high potential comes with even higher risk.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.37%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 18.10% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Performance Food Group (PFGC) accounts for about 0.30% of total assets, followed by Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC) and Caseys General Stores Inc (CASY).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.1% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHA seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index includes the small-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -0.07% so far this year and is down about -9.20% in the last one year (as of 03/16/2023).

It has amassed assets over $44.80 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.

Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for FNDF are 0.25%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 3.05%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Shell Plc (SHEL) accounts for about 2.67% of the fund's total assets, followed by Samsung Electronics Ltd and Totalenergies (TTE).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 12.99% of FNDF's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added roughly 1.65% and is down about -1.48% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 03/16/2023), respectively. FNDF has traded between $25.15 and $32.80 during this last 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 22.14% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 962 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index.

He says that if you have money in a brokerage account and the firm belongs to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) “then you’re covered up to $500,000 in losses in the event that the brokerage firm goes out of business.” McBride adds that “the SIPC does not protect you against investment losses. So if the value of your account's going to fluctuate. SIPC insurance doesn't protect you against that.”If you have money on deposit at a credit union, and it’s federally insured through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, it provides a similar backstop to the FDIC. McBride says “Before you put your money in a credit union, just make sure that they are protected by that National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Just like with a bank, you want to make sure you're putting your money in a place that's federally insured, but as long as that's the case, you are protected up to $250,000 just as you would by the FDIC at a bank.”Key video moments0:12 How your money is protected in a brokerage account0:47 How you’re protected in a credit union]"

Nucor expects first quarter earnings to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share. Nucor reported net earnings of $4.89 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $7.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2022.Included in the fourth quarter of 2022 earnings were the following: an approximately $60.4 million net benefit, or $0.24 per diluted share, related to state tax credits; an approximately $88.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, net benefit related to a change in a valuation allowance of a state deferred tax asset; and a pre-tax $96.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, charge to write-off the remaining carrying value of our leasehold interest in unproved oil and gas properties.The profitability of the steel mills segment is expected to increase in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher margins and volumes, with the largest improvement expected to occur at our sheet mills.Within the steel products segment, we expect continued strong profitability in the first quarter of 2023, with some decrease expected from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to slower construction activity and some reductions in realized pricing. Overall, we expect first quarter 2023 steel products segment earnings to be higher than the first quarter of 2022.In the raw materials segment, excluding the impact of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect increased profitability compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher volumes at our DRI facilities and scrap recycling and brokerage operations.On a combined basis, the operating income during the first quarter of 2023 from our three business segments is expected to exceed that of the fourth quarter of 2022. However, we expect consolidated net earnings to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to less favorable intercompany eliminations in the first quarter of 2023 and the absence of state tax benefits that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fluctuations in intercompany eliminations are largely driven by sales activity between segments and the change in value of intercompany inventory at the end of each quarter based on the timing of shipments between segments and to external customers.Story continuesNucor has repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares at an average price of $158.57 per share during the first quarter.

Furthermore, the recent pullback in DE shares makes the company’s valuation very intruiging at 13.2X forward earnings which is 58% below its decade high of 31.8X and a 20% discount to the median of 16.6X.Plus, Deere stock is still up +225% over the last three years to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s +64% and top the Machinery-Farm Markets +211%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor (NUE)Also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is steel producer Nucor which largely outperformed the broader market during the peak of inflationary concerns in correlation with higher commodity prices.Nucor stock is still up +10% year to date but has drifted lower over the last few trading sessions. Despite short-term weakness in the broader market, Nucor’s earnings estimate revisions have continued to soar throughout the quarter.Story continuesFiscal 2023 earnings estimates have soared 23% and FY24 estimates have jumped 14% as Nucor continues to stick out among the Basic Materials sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis is also a great sign as Nucor's earnings are forecasted to drop -51% in FY23 to $14.12 per share after a very exceptional year with EPS at $28.79 in 2022. However, Nucor’s valuation also stands out at the moment at 11X forward earnings and 73% below its decade high of 41.4X while offering a 26% discount to the median of 15X.More impressive, Nucor stock is still up a very stellar +373% over the last three years to crush the benchmark and beat the Steel-Producers Markets +250%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe rising earnings estimate revisions make Deere and Nucor stock prime candidates to buy on the dip and their strong performances could continue as the recent market volatility subsides.

Its cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.Output to Pick Up 2023 OnwardsIn 2022, the company registered a 6.6% year-over-year decline in copper production to 894,703 tons, due to work stoppage at the Cuajone mine as well as lower ore grades. Molybdenum production was 13.3% down to 26,240 tons as a result of lower ore grades at the Toquepala mine. Zinc production was down 10.4% year over year to 60,010 tons due to lower production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara mines. Mined silver production was 18.56 million ounces, down 2.1% from last year. This was mainly due to a decline in production at Peruvian operations and the La Caridad mine which was partially offset by higher production at Buenavista and IMMSA mines.These numbers are expected to pick up and reach 926,000 tons in 2023. This will be made possible by the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production on projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrators.Solid Projects on TrackSouthern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion, including the Michiquillay ($2.5 billion) and Los Chancas ($2.6 billion) projects. Peru is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. Production is expected to commence by 2032.The Los Chancas project located in Apurimac, Peru is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of the concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The project is expected to commence in 2030.The company has a number of other projects that are planned to be developed in the future, which will help in attaining its copper volume production target of 1.5 million tons by 2031.Story continuesMetal Prices to Pick Up in the Long TermCopper prices had been on a downtrend in 2022 amid uncertainties surrounding the global economy, as new coronavirus restrictions in China affected the demand for the red metal, thus hurting prices. Zinc prices also bore the brunt of weak demand worries as COVID lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Silver prices had also been negatively impacted, weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth.Industrial production in China has lagged expectations for the first two months of this year while political unrest in South America is fueling supply concerns. This has been weighing on copper prices lately.The long-term outlook for copper is positive, as copper demand is expected to grow, driven by electric vehicles and renewable energy, and infrastructure investments. Copper prices will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States, as well as global initiatives to address climate change.Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand and reduced supply. Long-term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption. Silver prices will gain eventually, given its industrial use, impending demand-supply imbalance and safe-haven demand.Industry Leading Reserves &amp; Low Cost: A Winning CombinationSouthern Copper has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates high-quality, world-class assets in investment-grade countries such as Mexico and Peru. Backed by its constant focus on increasing low-cost production and growth investments, the company is well-poised to continue delivering enhanced performance. Its efforts to lower costs have aided the company to negate the impacts of higher costs for diesel and fuel, operating and repair materials, supplies and energy, as well as higher labor costs.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s shares have fallen 2.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s 14% growth.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSouthern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics Inc.

This helps it to enjoy a robust scale. Its focus on balanced revenue growth across profitable markets and superior client services is likely to help it grow its market share and acquire new clients.The company’s data-driven and experiential technology platform is providing a competitive edge and is leading to increased client engagements, which is encouraging.Moreover, with the increasing trend of outsourcing real estate needs by companies, new contract wins and the expansion of services with existing clients are likely to aid JLL’s Work Dynamics segment’s performance.To enhance its global growth strategy and expand its capabilities in certain service offerings, JLL has been making strategic acquisitions.

19,34a8495c-8b04-3a93-b1bc-a4a3f10e9e6f,UNM,2023-03-16,Unum (UNM) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-upgraded-buy-does-160004493.html,1678896004,STORY,['UNM'],"[Investors might want to bet on Unum (UNM), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Unum is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Unum, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for UnumThis insurance company is expected to earn $6.62 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 6.6%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Unum. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Unum to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 14.3% loss over the past four weeks.Disciplined sales trends, strong persistency, an improving rate environment, favorable risk experience and a solid capital position continue to drive Unum’s shares.This leading disability income writer and the second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States targets premium from core business to increase 4-6% over the long term. Solid operational performance, favorable benefits experience as well as solid top-line growth in the core businesses should continue to fuel growth and help UNM achieve its targeted growth.Management remains focused on moving on to a mix of businesses with higher growth and stable margins.  Its sustained solid operating results have been fueling a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, cushioning financial flexibility. This in turn helps UNM engage in effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders value.This insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.4%. Revenues are expected to be $3.06 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Unum, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on UNM going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.Story continuesThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

21,f8b6c9f3-0e40-3fbd-a372-bfef617f40ad,UNM,2023-03-16,Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tap-5-bargain-stocks-impressive-114611614.html,1678880771,STORY,"['EBR-B', 'CCU', 'UNM']","[Price-to-earnings (P/E), given its inherent simplicity, is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at a bargain. However, even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric has a few downsides.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm’s equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Global Ship Lease, Inc. GSL, Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. CCU, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Unum Group UNM and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. EBR are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company.EBITDA, the other constituent of the ratio, gives a clearer picture of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dampen net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Generally, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.  However, unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet. Given this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is usually used to value the possible acquisition targets. Stocks with a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates.Another drawback of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements.As such, a strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen bargain stocks.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that passed the screen:Global Ship Lease owns containerships with a diversified fleet of mid-sized and smaller containerships.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.State Street Corporation in FocusHeadquartered in Boston, State Street Corporation (STT) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -1.07% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.63 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.28%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.95%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.77%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.52 is up 5% from last year. State Street Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.44%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. State Street Corporation's current payout ratio is 34%. This means it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for STT for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.59 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 15.92%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, STT is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The consensus estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.Designer Brands has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32% on average. In the last reported quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.5%.Key Factors to NoteDesigner Brands’ quarterly performance might have been hurt by a challenging operating landscape, including numerous issues like supply-chain bottlenecks, inflation, higher costs and currency headwinds. Higher inflationary pressures have been hitting the consumers’ discretionary spending and in turn, weighing on the company’s performance.Any deleverage in SG&amp;A costs might have been added deterrents. All these limitations might have hurt the company’s performance during the quarter under review.On the flip side, the company is smoothly progressing in its brand-building strategy. It is also focused on customer acquisition, optimizing assortment and developing brands to aid growth. Designer Brands’ flexible business model has been helping the company navigate a tough macro landscape.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Designer Brands this time around.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.25 billion, indicating an improvement of 18.4% from the prior-year quarter’s level.The bottom line of this discount retailer is also expected to have increased from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share has dipped a penny to $2.96 over the past seven days, suggesting an increase of 15.2% from the year-ago period’s reported number.We expect sales to grow 17.1% to $10.13 billion and adjusted earnings per share to jump 13.3% to $2.91.Dollar General has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 0.7% on average. In the last reported quarter, this Goodlettsville, TN-based player missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.6%.Key Factors to NoteDollar General’s better pricing, private-label offerings and effective inventory management are likely to have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter’s top line. The company’s operational capabilities, coupled with its real estate growth strategy, position it well to gain market share by targeting low-to-middle-income-group consumers. It has also been focusing on consumable and non-consumable categories to boost traffic.The company has been steadily expanding its self-checkout facility. We also remain encouraged by the company’s host of initiatives, such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, digitization and private fleet.However, Dollar General has been encountering challenges related to incremental transportation, distribution and payroll costs, as well as supply-chain headwinds. Also, the company has been witnessing higher selling, general and administrative expenses for a while now.On Feb 23, management issued preliminary fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results. It said that the soft performance was due to the below-than-anticipated sales and higher-than-anticipated inventory damages owing to the winter storm Elliott.Story continuesDollar General further informed that fourth-quarter same-store sales came below management’s expectations, despite continued market share gains in sales of both consumable and non-consumable products. The metric grew 5.7% compared to the company’s projection of an approximately 6-7% increase. The softer-than-expected performance was due to lower-than-anticipated same-store sales results in December, primarily due to the storm.Nonetheless, same-store sales in November and January increased 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively, and were within the company’s earlier provided guidance range, while the metric increased 4.5% in December. Management foresees fourth-quarter earnings in the band of $2.91-$2.96 per share, down from the prior view of $3.15-$3.30.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Dollar General this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here, as elaborated below.

For more retailers, head on over to 5 Biggest Retailers in the World. The retail industry is one of the largest sectors in the world, and one that has been disrupted by the internet and technology revolution. While traditionally retailers were limited to the brick and mortar operating model, the growth of the internet and the increasing use of smartphones and computers has forced them to place their operations online and created new areas such as last mile delivery.Subsequently, some of the biggest retailing companies in the world are online retailers, with this fact holding true for none other than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose massive success all over the world has made its founder Mr. Jeff Bezos one of the world's richest men. Additionally, out of the myriad of industries out there, the retail sector is one of the most valuable since its value is often estimated not in billions but in trillions of dollars. For instance, a research report from The Business Research Company outlines that the global retail market was worth $23.65 trillion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3% to sit at $26.3 trillion by the end 2022. From then until 2026, the research firm believes that the industry will continue to grow at a 10.1% CAGR and be worth $38.71 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Adding to this, business consulting firm McKinsey believes that retailers will have to transform their business operations if they want to stay ahead in today's evolving environment. In a recent post, it shares that retail companies have to broaden their horizons to include new avenues such as omni-channel businesses, asset development such as logistics management, monetization of their ecosystems to benefit from trends such as big data analytics, and adding services such as pet care and travel to their portfolio.Today we'll look at the retail giants of the world to find out the biggest players in the industry.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walmart (WMT).Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.1% and 13.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Walmart, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in WMT?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 6.2% over the past month to $6.10.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(WMT) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-walmart-inc-wmt-130001435.html,1678885201,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -5.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has lost 4.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -3%. This estimate has changed -6.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.72 indicates a change of +10.1% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $148.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $631.16 billion and $650.57 billion estimates indicate +3.3% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $164.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.3%. EPS of $1.71 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159.66 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +12.5%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(FDIC) announced that regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and took control of its deposits. This was the biggest bank failure in the United States since the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008 and the second-biggest bank failure in the nation’s history. Market participants are highly concerned that the SVB crisis will significantly dent confidence of investors in the United States.Meanwhile, the February CPI print might have soothed some nerves. The big numbers on monthly CPI reports are of the year-over-year variety: headline CPI over the past year (or the inflation rate), which came in at +6.0%, just as expected, and 40 bps lower than January. This is good news for the economy as a whole, and demonstrates the Fed’s effectiveness in fighting inflation with interest rate hikes.With the influx of good and bad news, markets today lack clarity on the broader economic picture. Therefore, volatile trading in U.S. stocks is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through.

AMP, Everest Re Group Ltd.'s RE, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP, Henry Schein Inc. HSIC and HSBC Holdings plc HSBC.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Fed May Stock to 25bps Rate Hike After SVB Fiasco: 5 PicksWall Street tumbled last week following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank — the biggest bank failure since the days of the great recession of 2008. Market participants remained highly concerned that the ripple effect of the bank's failure may shake the broad market. However, a sliver lining in the SVB disaster is that the Fed may be compelled to stick to a 25 basis points hike in interest rate in its March FOMC meeting.A Hawkish FedThe Fed hiked the benchmark interest by a staggering 4.25% in 2022 to combat 40-year high inflation. The inflation rate reached its peak at 9.1% in June 2022 and thereafter declined to 6 — 6.5% in December, though it stayed significantly higher than the central bank's 2% target rate.A steady decline in the inflation rate in the last three months of 2022 enabled the Fed to reduce the magnitude of rate hike to 25 basis points. However, a sudden spike in inflation in January and a series of strong economic data changed the whole scenario.On Mar 7 and 8, in his testimony to the U.S. Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that interest rates are likely to head higher than what central bank policymakers had anticipated. In the December FOMC meeting, Fed officials had estimated the terminal interest rate to be at 5.1% for this rate hike cycle.However, after Powell's testimony, the CME FedWatch showed that market participants expect the terminal interest rate to be within the 5.5% to 5.75% range. Moreover, the CME FedWatch showed a 73.5% probability that the Fed would hike the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in the March FOMC meeting while the probability of a 25 basis-points hike is just 26.5%. These situations were almost reversed just before the release of Powell's testimony.Story continuesGovernment Assures SVB Depositors About Their MoneyMarket participants' expectations regarding rate hike have changed significantly after last week's SVB debacle. The bank is the first major casualty of the Fed's aggressive rate hike. A large section of economists and financial experts have warned that the Federal Government should immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank's failure will shake the broad market.Investors are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. Clients of SVB's startup companies, especially from the technology sector, will find it hard to run their business. Venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital. This has forced the U.S. government to assure all SVB depositors about their money.Moreover, the Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls came in at 311,000 in February, beating the consensus estimate of 227,000. However, the number declined significantly from January's data of 504,000.The unemployment rate increased to 3.6% in February from 3.4% in January. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% in February compared with a 0.3% rise in January. Year over year, hourly wage rate rose 4.6% in February, below the consensus estimate of 4.8%.Consequently, the CME FedWatch is now showing an overwhelming 70.9% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the March FOMC meeting. Importantly, 29.1% respondents expect the central bank to keep the interest rate static at the current range of 4.5 to 4.75%. No respondent expects a more than 25 basis point rate hike.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have applied our VGM Style Score to narrow the search to select five companies that have strong earnings growth potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ameriprise Financial Inc. provides various financial products and services to individual and institutional clients in the United States and internationally.

This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, Microchip Technology and Silicon Laboratories.About the IndustryThis industry includes mostly semiconductor chip manufacturers like Intel Corporation (INTC).Major Themes for the IndustryThis is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.The industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Data center demand has also dropped off sharper than expected as leading tech players absorbed the reduction in advertising demand. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains. The situation is expected to gradually improve as we get into the second half partly because some of the demand is expected to come back, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didn't have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. That's because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As semiconductors become important in defense, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Relatively Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #57, which places it in the top 23% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates relatively strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, it appears that analyst opinion about the 2023 outlook has improved while that for 2024 has weakened slightly: 2023 estimates have risen 5.9% over the past year, while 2024 estimates have dropped 3.7%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance Is AttractiveThe Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the S&amp;P 500 through most of the past year and starting from November it has pulled way ahead as the S&amp;P essentially flatlined. The broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector has trailed the S&amp;P 500 since April.Overall, the industry gained 13.1% over the past year while the broader sector lost 14.1% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.0%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 17.12X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500's 17.33X and the broader computer and technology sector's 21.22X. At the current level, it is however trading at a premium to its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between a 13.80X and 18.74X multiple over the past year.3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc.: Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Analog Devices' strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. Demand in these markets, particularly for automation and electrification are currently driving its business. These along with pervasive sensing, AI-driven edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity that are enabling new capabilities, applications and markets at the Intelligent Edge are secular drivers.As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing its output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has allowed it to lower lead times. However, it still has a significant backlog, which would translate into a year's revenue at the current level.Shipments are expected to increase through the year, bringing the backlog back to normal levels. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 13%, making it the fifth consecutive double-digit increase, and the 19th straight year of dividend increase.The company beat January quarter estimates by 6.2% and in the last 30 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company dropped a couple of cents The 2024 estimate increased by 90 cents (9.0%).The shares are up 25.3% over the past year.Microchip Technology Inc.: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip's demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where supply constraints are only now beginning to ease up.Management is currently focused on bringing down its backlog while maintaining the quality of new orders. As supply continues to improve and lead times come down, profitability will also improve. However, China's imposing and then suddenly raising its lockdown has resulted in inventory gluts that are an overhang on Microchip's business.Investors would be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 41.5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 7 cents (1.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate increased 35 cents (6.0%) during the same period.#2 ranked Microchip's shares are up 19.3% over the past year.Silicon Laboratories Inc.: Silicon Laboratories is a fabless semiconductor company offering wireless microcontrollers and sensor products primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan. Its products are used in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including connected home and security, industrial automation and control, smart metering, smart lighting, commercial building automation, consumer electronics, asset tracking and medical instrumentation.Silicon Laboratories is seeing solid momentum in its business, which has allowed it to double its organic revenue in two years  and increase its design wins by 120%. Management continues to see significant opportunity and expects the design win momentum to continue, further building its leadership position in IoT, despite the macroeconomic uncertainties.Silicon Laboratories topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 35.1% in the last quarter. Its 2023 EPS estimate has jumped a dollar (25.3%) in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 49 cents (9.0%).Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 stock are up 26.2% over the past year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Hackett Group and Gartner are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HCKT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.32, while IT has a forward P/E of 33.75. We also note that HCKT has a PEG ratio of 0.84. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. IT currently has a PEG ratio of 5.19.Another notable valuation metric for HCKT is its P/B ratio of 9.92. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IT has a P/B of 111.33.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HCKT's Value grade of A and IT's Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth HCKT and IT are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that HCKT is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

46,dfdbd9fc-e1a9-3ca0-a569-0a6d6b0f21d0,IT,2023-03-16,Here’s what CHROs actually think about the potential ban on noncompetes,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chros-actually-think-potential-ban-113700284.html,1678880220,STORY,['IT'],"[Good morning!The Federal Trade Commission's proposed ban on noncompete agreements sparked fervent debate about the positive and negative implications for employers. But what do CHROs think about the news? Gartner’s latest monthly insight report suggests that most HR heads are fairly optimistic about what the potential ban could mean for sourcing talent.The proposed rule aims to better protect workers and foster a healthier environment for people seeking to change jobs. “Noncompetes block workers from freely switching jobs, depriving them of higher wages and better working conditions, and depriving businesses of a talent pool that they need to build and expand,” said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a prior statement. Many people leaders recognize the potential upsides as well.In fact, a majority of the over 280 HR heads surveyed by Gartner last month said that the ban would provide access to a larger pool of skilled workers—72% to be exact. In addition, 48% said they believe it will actually improve competition for talent, and 46% believe it will promote better workplace diversity.“A lot of people suggested it would hurt companies [and] make a bad situation worse,” says Dion Love, vice president of advisory in the Gartner HR practice. “But in my work, I’m finding the smart companies actually see things differently, and they're turning it to their advantage. It is a little counterintuitive.”HR executives are preemptively planning to respond to the potential ban by actually increasing investment in their people. To offset no longer having noncompetes as a way to retain employees, 47% of survey respondents said that their organizations will offer more learning or growth opportunities, and 41% said they will compete with higher salaries. A significant number (38%) also reported that they plan to increase internal focus on promoting work-life balance to prevent losing valuable talent to competitors.“When we boil it all down, what we're talking about here are strategies to keep people in a tight labor market, and we're weighing their relative merits,” Love tells Fortune. “And when one strategy goes away, they pivot to another, and that's exactly what they're doing.”Story continuesAmber Burtonamber.burton@fortune.com@amberbburtonThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

However, traders are abandoning bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates amid the banking turmoil.Further oil price gains may be limited in the near term, with OPEC this week forecasting a modest surplus in the second quarter, a typical period of soft demand before the summer.

Yet the oil-producing group noted rising interest rates as cause for concern with regard to global economic growth.""China's reopening, following the lifting of the strict zero-COVID-19 policy, will add considerable momentum to global economic growth,"" OPEC said in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report.""The rapid rises in interest rates and global debt levels could cause significant negative spill-over effects, and may negatively impact the global growth dynamic.""The latest news that provided some support to prices was the news that the Swiss central bank will lend up to $54 billion to troubled Credit Suisse to prop up its liquidity.

Both contracts plummeted around 11% this week, and were at their weakest levels since December 2021.News that embattled Swiss lender Credit Suisse Group AG (SIX:CSGN) secured a $54 billion credit facility from the Swiss National Bank also helped ease some concerns over an imminent banking crisis.But with the collapse of three U.S. banks over the past week, markets feared contagion in the broader economy. This in turn fed concerns that a potential recession will severely crimp oil demand this year.Oil prices have plummeted so far this year amid growing concerns that a global recession will largely offset a recovery in Chinese demand. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also warned of such a scenario recently.A recovery in the dollar, which rebounded from three-week lows in overnight trade, also added to pressure on oil prices, given that a strong dollar makes crude more expensive for international buyers.Data showing that U.S. crude inventories grew more than expected in the week to March 10 pushed up concerns over slowing demand. U.S. inventories have now grown for 11 of the past 12 weeks, pushing up concerns over a potential supply glut in the world’s largest crude consumer.Story continuesWhile Goldman Sachs helped spur some optimism over China, mixed economic readings from the country over the past week presented a staggered recovery from COVID-era lows. Oil imports to the country also fell in the January-February period, despite the lifting of anti-COVID measures.Crude markets are focused squarely on any new developments in the banking sector, with both U.S. and European governments racing to reassure investors over stability among major lenders.Related ArticlesOil rises from 15-mth low on China hopes, bank crisis fears persistGold slips from 6-week high, but bank crisis underpins demandOil slumps nearly 5% to lowest in more than a year as banking fears mount]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this investment bank have returned -10.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 16% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.76 per share, indicating a change of -14.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.21 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.4%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.98 indicates a change of +10.7% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.6%. The $56.32 billion and $58.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.84%. The EPS surprise was +4.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Trix Property road is accessible and is located 4 km south of Rock Tech Lithium's MNW lithium deposit.Due diligence sampling was undertaken in the claim region in the fall of 2022 and multiple assays returned over 1.0% lithium oxide (Li2O) with a high of  5.48% Li2O. The Company intends to carry out extensive surface sampling and other exploration work to find the source of the high-grade lithium occurrences.Historically, Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) geologists discovered a 10-tonne spodumene pegmatite boulder along with small spodumene-bearing fragments located in a creek on the Trix Lithium Property. A glacial geology study identified a potential source direction and displacement of two (2) kilometers from the location of the spodumene-bearing glacial erratic.The spodumene-bearing pegmatites of the Georgia Lake area were first discovered in 1955. Subsequent to the initial discovery, numerous claims were staked and additional lithium deposits were subsequently located.  While some work was conducted in the following decades, most historical exploration was completed in 1955-1958. However, recent advancements in the Electric Vehicle market has turned the Georgia Lake area into a very active exploration district.Under the terms of the agreement, the Company can acquire 100% interest in the Property through payment of $200,000 in cash, issuing  2,500,000 shares, and carrying out $ 750,000 in exploration work over 3 years. There is a 2.0 % of Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) over the Property payable upon the commencement of commercial production on these claims.Story continuesThis above-noted agreement is with a non-related party and there are no directors, officers or senior management in common.

Still, let’s look at a few stocks that are setting up nicely on the long side this month.CRMSalesforce$173.18NVDANvidia$229.65DKSDick’s Sporting Goods$146.27Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been enjoying a strong rally off its December low. Coming into earnings, shares were up 32%. At the recent high, the stock was up almost 42%. None of that matters though, as shares ripped higher on earnings.The stock jumped 11.5% after Salesforce delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue grew more than 14% year over year and the company’s operating cash flow was robust.Even better, Salesforce guided for better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and above-consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the full year.That type of fundamental improvement has a tendency to drive a stronger technical situation, which is exactly what we have with Salesforce stock. If the stock can’t hold current support, we could see a gap-fill down to the $168 area and potentially a dip to the low-$160s.However, it may be worth taking a shot on this one, particularly if the overall market can find its footing.Story continuesNvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has not had the easiest run. As a large-cap growth stock, short-sellers and bears gunned for this name amid the raid on growth stocks.It didn’t help that sagging demand and lower orders were hindering Nvidia’s guidance and quarterly reports.Last quarter, sales sank 20% year over year to $6.05 billion, but topped expectations by $30 million. Not exactly robust, but it helped that earnings beat analysts’ expectations too. It helped considerably that guidance for the first quarter topped consensus estimates.I admittedly am a long-term bull on Nvidia and I also admit this quarter was not exactly a blowout result. Instead, it was better-than-feared, but I’m not one to fight the trend. Nvidia stock continues to hold up well, still up more than 100% from the low.Until some of these trends break, the stock is firmly in the buy-the-dip camp, although it would be a juicy buy after a harrowing decline should the market get dicey here.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)An image of a Dick's Sporting Goods retail locationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we’re going to the retail sector with Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS). This is considerably smaller than the previous two companies, with a market cap of roughly $12.5 billion.Size hasn’t been a deterrent though, with the stock recently notching new all-time highs. Shares rallied 11% after reporting earnings on March 7 and the subsequent rally carried it to new highs.The retailer delivered a top- and bottom-line beat, full-year earnings guidance that topped analysts’ expectations and more than doubled its quarterly dividend to $1.00 a share. That gives the stock a yield of roughly 3% while trading around 10.5 times this year’s earnings outlook.That is very impressive, given the bumpy situation with consumers. Given the strength in the stock and the recent weakness in the overall market, the situation with Dick’s can go one of two ways.Either investors sell the stock to lock in profit or it becomes a hide-out spot for investors looking for a combination of strong fundamentals and technicals.Until proven otherwise, this stock is also a buy-the-dip candidate for now.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

65,cb08ddf5-4bd7-3365-80ea-bf23ee20b30c,MCO,2023-03-16,8 Stocks That Warren Buffett Dominates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-stocks-warren-buffett-dominates-111901677.html,1678706341,STORY,"['USB', 'BRK-A', 'CVX', 'HPQ', 'BAC', 'AXP', 'MCO', 'OXY', 'KO', 'BRK-B']","[Warren Buffett is arguably the most successful investor of all time. Through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), the so-called “Oracle of Omaha” has amassed a huge investment portfolio that is today worth $333 billion.Warren Buffett is a classic value investor and discerning in his stock picks. He searches out companies that have a moat around their business and a durable competitive advantage. Additionally, he tends to focus on undervalued stocks, noted for his prescient stock purchases when markets are selling off. Indeed, this was certainly the case over the past year.And while Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends, Buffett prefers stocks that offer a quarterly payout to shareholders. Also known for concentrating his positions, Warren Buffett has said that when he finds a stock he likes, he buys as much of it as he can. This approach has made him the biggest shareholder in several important businesses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are eight stocks where Warren Buffett is the number one shareholder today.AXPAmerican Express$165.70BACBank of America$30.27CVXChevron$159.67KOCoca-Cola$59.21HPQHP Inc.$27.45MCOMoody’s$285.09OXYOccidental Petroleum$59.86PARAParamount Global$19.89American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockWarren Buffett has held positions in American Express (NYSE:AXP) since the 1960s. However, his current work in the credit card giant dates to the 1980s.Today, the Oracle of Omaha owns more than 150 million shares of AXP stock, worth $26 billion or about 20% of the company, making him its largest shareholder. The next largest shareholder, Vanguard, owns only 6% of American Express. Buffett has long been a fan of American Express and its business model, mainly because its credit cards are used for business and leisure pursuits.In interviews over the years, Buffett has expressed his admiration for American Express’ strong brand and customer loyalty. He also likes the fact that American Express caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, during recessionary environments, the company has managed to keep its bad loan totals down.Story continuesThese factors give American Express a wide moat around its core business, which is what Buffett looks for when deciding to take a position in a stock.Lastly, American Express is more diversified than other credit card issuers, having an end-to-end payments network that Buffett has singled out as beneficial to the company and its shareholders.Bank of America (BAC)As It Tests Support, Bank of America Stock Provides a Trading OpportunitySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett has long been a fan of bank stocks and has held positions in most major U.S. lenders at one time or another. However, his most prominent position in a bank stock is in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Berkshire Hathaway owns over one billion BAC stock shares, worth nearly $34 billion, amounting to a 12.9% stake in the lender. Bank of America is Berkshire Hathaway’s second-largest holding after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Its Bank of America position is 10% of Berkshire’s current portfolio.Buffett dramatically increased his Bank of America position in recent years, buying the stock hand-over-fist during the pandemic in 2020 when BAC stock fell below $20. The stock has since recovered, and is now trading above $30 per share. However, BAC stock is currently 27% below its 52-week high of $44.63, as it declined over the past year along with the broader market.That said, Buffett remains committed to Bank of America. While he has recently trimmed his position in other bank stocks, notably in US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Bank of America appears to be his long-term pick in this sector. That’s something all investors should take into consideration.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThe media tends to focus on Buffett’s other significant oil holdings, but Berkshire Hathaway is now the single largest shareholder in Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The company’s stake in Chevron grew steadily throughout 2022 as crude oil prices crested above $120 a barrel. Today, Berkshire owns more than 167 million shares of CVX stock, which comprises nearly 9% of the company and is valued at $27.55 billion. Berkshire’s Chevron holding makes up roughly 8.3% of the company’s overall portfolio.Warren Buffett had incredible foresight regarding Chevron, first buying the stock in mid-2020 before oil prices took off. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in CVX stock five-fold as crude prices increased following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Chevron’s share price has retreated alongside declining energy prices in recent months, and are now trading 14% lower than its 52-week high of $189.68 reached last November. However, Buffett, no doubt likes that Chevron pays a hefty quarterly dividend that currently yields 3.8%. Chevron has also used its windfall profits from the past year to launch a new $75 billion stock buyback program.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is arguably the stock Buffett is most associated with. Holding the same position in the Atlanta-based beverage giant since the late-1980s, Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million KO stock worth $24 billion, making up approximately 7.2% of Buffett’s portfolio.With a 9.2% ownership stake, Buffett is Coca-Cola’s largest shareholder. He’s also one of the biggest soft drink fans, so much so that he has had a Coke dispenser installed at Berkshire Hathaway’s head office in Omaha, Nebraska.In addition to being a reliable stock in good and bad economic times, Coca-Cola has also been a dividend powerhouse for Berkshire Hathaway. With a current dividend yield of 3.1% and a quarterly payout of 46 cents per share, Berkshire Hathaway will make $736 million from Coca-Cola’s dividend payments this year alone. No wonder Buffett frequently boasts that his investment in Coca-Cola has paid for itself many times over the past three decades.HP Inc. (HPQ)Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comThis is a strange one. While many people know Buffett’s biggest holding is tech giant Apple, few people would know that Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder of legacy tech company HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ).A personal computer and printer maker, HP has been in business since 1939, and the home where the company was founded in Palo Alto, California, has been designated as a historical landmark and marked with a plaque that reads: “Birthplace of ‘Silicon Valley.'”Buffett’s interest in HP’s stock likely has nothing to do with sentimentality. Berkshire Hathaway owns 120 million HPQ shares valued at $3.35 billion. While the HP stake makes up only 1% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, it constitutes 12.3% of Hewlett-Packard’s outstanding shares, making Buffett its largest shareholder.HP stock has been a bit of a laggard among tech firms, having risen only 14% over the last five years to $28 a share. However, the stock does pay a hefty dividend yield of 3.8%, with a quarterly payout of 26 cents per share.Moody’s (MCO)A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comLike most of Buffett’s stock holdings, credit rating agency Moody’s Corp. (NYSE:MCO) has a wide moat and durable competitive advantage. The New York City-based company is part of a duopoly with fellow credit rating agency S&amp;P Global Ratings (NYSE:SPGI). Currently, Moody’s and S&amp;P Global each control about 40% of the global market for credit ratings. This puts Moody’s in a strong position and makes it a solid long-term investment.Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 25 million shares of MCO stock, giving it a 13.5% stake in the credit rating agency and making it the company’s largest shareholder. Valued at $7.26 billion, Moody’s position accounts for 2.2% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.Indeed, Moody’s stock has been a solid performer for Buffett. The company’s share price is up 7% this year in what continues to be a volatile market, and it has gained 73% over the last five years to trade at $294 per share. Furthermore, Moody’s quarterly dividend of 77 cents a share (1% yield) provides another reason to get excited about this stock.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comNews just broke that Buffett is again buying shares of energy giant Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Regulatory filings show that Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 5.8 million oil company shares at the start of March, paying between $59.80 and $61.90 per share. The latest purchase means that Berkshire now owns 200 million shares of OXY stock, or 22% of the company, worth $12 billion based on the current share price of around $60.Occidental Petroleum is now among the top 10 holdings in Berkshire Hathaway’s $332 billion portfolio. Last year, Buffett received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of OXY stock, raising speculation that he might buy all of the Houston-based oil company.Buffett tends to buy the stock any time it falls to around $60 a share or lower. Occidental’s stock is flat on the year after more than doubling in price during 2022 when global prices for crude oil were elevated.Paramount Global (PARA)girl looking fascinated eating popcorn watching a movie at the local movie theatreSource: Zoriana Zaitseva / Shutterstock.comThis is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s newest positions in the company. As is typical, Warren Buffett has been buying shares of entertainment company Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) in droves. The latest regulatory filings show that Buffett bought 2.4 million shares of PARA stock in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the price slumped. He started purchasing the stock in the first quarter of 2022, and now holds more than 93.5 million shares worth $2 billion.Although Paramount Global’s position makes up less than 1% of Berkshire’s portfolio, the holding company is now the largest shareholder of the entertainment conglomerate. Currently, Berkshire owns a 15.4% ownership stake in the media giant. Today, Paramount Global owns the Paramount Pictures film studio, the CBS television network, and a host of specialty TV channels such as MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central. Additionally, the company is ramping up its Paramount+ and Pluto TV streaming services.PARA stock likely appeals to Buffett as it is relatively cheap at $21 a share and with a price-earnings ratio of 21-times. Plus, the company pays a chunky dividend that yields 4.6%, or quarterly payment to stockholders of 24 cents per share.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in BAC and AAPL.

Compared to pre-pandemic levels inventory is down $485 million or 21% without acquisitions, and down 8% overall.Signet achieved an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio(1) of 2.0x, well within its stated goal of below 2.75 times EBITDAR.(1) See non-GAAP financial measures within Item 7 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.Return of Capital:Signet's Board of Directors (""Board"") has declared a quarterly cash dividend on common shares of $0.23 per share for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, payable May 26, 2023 to shareholders of record on April 28, 2023, with an ex-dividend date of April 27, 2023.During Fiscal 2023, Signet repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares at an average cost per share of $70.06, or $426 million, including $64.9 million during the fourth quarter and $50 million from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program from Fiscal 2022. On March 15, 2023, the Board approved a $263 million increase to the multi-year authorization under its share repurchase program bringing the total remaining authorization to approximately $775 million, and is net of approximately $25 million of shares repurchased in Fiscal 2024 through the date of this release.Our Purpose and Sustainable Growth:As a company with a Purpose-inspired business strategy, Signet believes in ongoing leadership in Corporate Citizenship &amp; Sustainability and views Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") initiatives as an important growth driver. For the third year in a row, Signet is a Great Place to Work-Certified™ company based on survey responses for our team members. In addition, Great Place to Work® and Fortune magazine has named Signet to the 2022 Best Workplaces in Retail™ list. Signet's approach to supply chain risk management is a core component of our ESG program. As a tenured leader in the jewelry industry, Signet continues to hold our global suppliers to high ethical standards and prioritizes respect for human rights. The ""Signet Promise"" is Signet's public commitment to the integrity of our global diamond supply chain though our four-layered system of checks and balances to support consumer confidence.First quarter and full year Fiscal 2024 Guidance:Signet's first quarter and full year Fiscal 2024 guidance for sales, operating income and diluted EPS below is provided on a non-GAAP basis:First QuarterFiscal 2024 (2)Total sales$1.62 billion to $1.65 billion$7.67 billion to $7.84 billionOperating income (1)$97 million to $108 million$765 million to $800 millionDiluted EPS (1)$11.07 to $11.59(1)See description of non-GAAP financial measures below.(2)Fiscal 2024 is a 53-week fiscal year for Signet, ending February 3, 2024, driven by the retail industry calendar. The additional week will occur in Q4 of Fiscal 2024.Forecasted non-GAAP operating income and diluted EPS provided above excludes potential non-recurring charges, such as asset impairments or integration-related costs associated with the acquisition of Blue Nile. However, given the potential impact of non-recurring charges to the GAAP operating income and diluted EPS, we cannot provide forecasted GAAP operating income or diluted EPS or the probable significance of such items without unreasonable efforts. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP operating income and diluted EPS to corresponding forecasted GAAP amounts.The Company's first quarter and Fiscal 2024 Outlook is based on the following assumptions:Annual US Jewelry industry revenues are expected to be down mid-single digits. The Company's guidance contemplates market share gains against this total industry performance range.Planned capital investments up to $200 million, reflecting investments in banner differentiation, including stores, Connected Commerce capabilities, and digital and technology advancement.The Company expects headwinds to continue in engagements with recovery later in Fiscal 2024, and continue to rebound in Fiscal 2025. Bridal overall, inclusive of engagements, historically represents approximately 47-49% of Signet's merchandise sales over the last five years.Additionally, with the slowing economy and continued inflationary pressures we do not expect to see a rebound in the lower price point consumer in the coming year.While timing and magnitude is difficult to predict, Signet also anticipates a continued shift of consumer discretionary spending away from the jewelry category reflecting decelerating levels of consumer confidence and pent-up demand for experience-oriented categories, as well as expects further impacts of inflation and other macroeconomic factors on consumer spending.Signet's efforts to mitigate supply chain disruption have been effective thus far. Guidance assumes no significant disruptions in availability of inventory.Annual tax rate of approximately 19% assumes no discrete items and no changes in current tax laws during Fiscal 2024.Earnings per share for Fiscal 2024 excludes the impact of any further share repurchases beyond the approximately 0.3 million shares repurchased in Fiscal 2024 through the date of this release, and includes the dilutive effect of the 8.1 million preferred shares.Conference Call:A conference call is scheduled for March 16, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. ET and a simultaneous audio webcast is available at www.signetjewelers.com.To pre-register for this call, please go to the following link:https://www.netroadshow.com/events/login?show=3e81ed21&amp;confId=46003You will receive your access details via email.Joining by Telephone:Canada dial-in number (Toll Free): 1 833 950 0062Canada dial-in number (Local): 1 226 828 7575United States: 1 844 200 6205United States (Local): 1 646 904 5544All other locations: +1 929 526 1599Access code: 677672A replay and transcript of the call will be posted on Signet's website as soon as they are available and will be accessible for one year.About Signet and Safe Harbor Statement:Signet Jewelers Limited is the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry.

The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating historical trends and current period performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP measures. Items may be excluded from GAAP financial measures when the Company believes this provides useful supplementary information to management and investors in assessing the operating performance of our business.Certain non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include non-GAAP operating income (loss), free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, and sales changes on a constant currency basis. The Company provides the year-over-year change in total sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to provide transparency to performance and enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends. The effect from foreign currency, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying current year average exchange rates to prior year sales in local currency.The Company estimates the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a statutory tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures.Adjusted free cash flow(in millions)Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Net cash provided by operating activities$               797.9$           1,257.3Purchase of property, plant and equipment(138.9)(129.6)Free cash flow659.01,127.7Proceeds from sale of in-house finance receivables—(81.3)Adjusted free cash flow$               659.0$           1,046.4 Non-GAAP gross margin(in millions)13 weeks ended January 28, 202313 weeks ended January 29, 202213 weeks ended February 1, 2020Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Gross margin$           1,111.1$           1,152.4$               897.9$           3,052.1$           3,124.0Restructuring charges - cost of sales——3.4——Acquisition and integration-related costs(1.8)5.4—13.45.4Non-GAAP gross margin$           1,109.3$           1,157.8$               901.3$           3,065.5$           3,129.4 Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses(in millions)13 weeks ended January 28, 202313 weeks ended January 29, 202213 weeks ended February 1, 2020Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Selling, general and administrative expenses$             (702.5)$             (745.8)$             (633.2)$         (2,214.6)$         (2,230.9)Acquisition and integration-related costs7.32.1—12.43.2Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$             (695.2)$             (743.7)$             (633.2)$         (2,202.2)$         (2,227.7) Non-GAAP operating income(in millions)13 weeks ended January 28, 202313 weeks ended January 29, 202213 weeks ended February 1, 2020Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Total GAAP operating income$               369.5$               402.4$               223.2$               604.9$               903.4Charges (credits) related to transformation plan——13.9—(3.3)Asset impairments, net (1)15.9(0.6)—15.9(0.9)Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)5.57.5—25.88.6Gain on sale of in-house receivables————(1.4)Litigation charges13.81.733.2203.81.7Total non-GAAP operating income$               404.7$               411.0$               270.3$               850.4$               908.1(1)Includes asset impairments, net recorded due to the various impacts of COVID-19 to the Company's business and related gains on terminations or modifications of leases, resulting from previously recorded impairments of the right of use assets in Fiscal 2021; Fiscal 2023 includes charges related to the Company's headquarters.(2)Acquisition and integration-related costs include the impact of the fair value step-up for inventory from Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile; as well as direct transaction-related and integration costs, primarily professional fees and severance, incurred for the acquisition of Blue Nile in Fiscal 2023; Fiscal 2022 included direct transaction-related costs for the acquisitions of Rocksbox and Diamonds Direct. North America segment non-GAAP operating income(in millions)13 weeks ended January 28, 202313 weeks ended January 29, 202213 weeks ended February 1, 2020Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022North America segment GAAP operating income$               372.9$               408.3$               255.5$               673.2$               981.4Charges (credits) related to transformation plan——7.8—(1.0)Asset impairments, net (1)15.9(0.1)—15.9(0.4)Gain related to sale of in-house receivables————(1.4)Litigation charges13.8——203.8—Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)5.57.5—25.88.6North America segment non-GAAP operating income$               408.1$               415.7$               263.3$               918.7$               987.2(1)Includes asset impairments, net recorded due to the various impacts of COVID-19 to the Company's business and related gains on terminations or modifications of leases, resulting from previously recorded impairments of the right of use assets in Fiscal 2021.

For more retailers, head on over to 5 Biggest Retailers in the World. The retail industry is one of the largest sectors in the world, and one that has been disrupted by the internet and technology revolution. While traditionally retailers were limited to the brick and mortar operating model, the growth of the internet and the increasing use of smartphones and computers has forced them to place their operations online and created new areas such as last mile delivery.Subsequently, some of the biggest retailing companies in the world are online retailers, with this fact holding true for none other than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose massive success all over the world has made its founder Mr. Jeff Bezos one of the world's richest men. Additionally, out of the myriad of industries out there, the retail sector is one of the most valuable since its value is often estimated not in billions but in trillions of dollars. For instance, a research report from The Business Research Company outlines that the global retail market was worth $23.65 trillion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3% to sit at $26.3 trillion by the end 2022. From then until 2026, the research firm believes that the industry will continue to grow at a 10.1% CAGR and be worth $38.71 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Adding to this, business consulting firm McKinsey believes that retailers will have to transform their business operations if they want to stay ahead in today's evolving environment. In a recent post, it shares that retail companies have to broaden their horizons to include new avenues such as omni-channel businesses, asset development such as logistics management, monetization of their ecosystems to benefit from trends such as big data analytics, and adding services such as pet care and travel to their portfolio.Today we'll look at the retail giants of the world to find out the biggest players in the industry. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the largest players are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Walmart Inc.

To be sure, a few advantages exist in targeting this sector over a lesser-capitalized fare. First, let’s discuss the obvious: blue-chip stocks to buy undergird popular if not relevant businesses. Therefore, it’s much easier for these stalwarts to convince retail investors to take a shot at them as opposed to no-name organizations.Second, the popularity of blue-chip stocks to buy commands far greater attention than random market ideas trading over the counter. Put another way, CNBC could do a piece on the troubled giant, thus potentially attracting an army of contrarians. Third, for blue chips, their current volatility may not be their first rodeo. Thus, they may have a framework from which to recover. Finally, before moving on, all of these securities trade within a range of 20% up from their five-year lows. With that, below are the blue-chip stocks to buy for contrarian investors.INTCIntel$27.22MDTMedtronic$76.72WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$33.26ULUnilever$48.74VZVerizon$36.68GPNGlobal Payments$100.00PYPLPayPal$73.43InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockOne of the semiconductor and technology firms in the world, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) organically commands significant respect. However, a series of sector challenges – most notably intense competition – and unforced errors took the sheen off Intel’s reputation. Unfortunately, the unusual troubles attracted the bears, who proceeded to beat up INTC. In the trailing five years, it’s down over 48%.Nevertheless, INTC could make up the ranks of severely deflated blue-chip stocks to buy. On paper, the company presents an undervalued profile. For example, the market prices INTC at a trailing multiple of 13.49. As a discount to earnings, Intel ranks better than 63% of the competition. Also, INTC trades at a trailing-year sales multiple of 1.73. In contrast, the sector median value is a lofty 2.44 times. As well, Intel features a price-to-book ratio of 1.08 times, below roughly 84% of the semiconductor industry. To be fair, Wall Street analysts peg INTC as a hold. Still, their average price target of $27.31 at least implies positive growth from the time of writing.Story continuesMedtronic (MDT)An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patientSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.comAn American medical device company, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) develops and manufactures healthcare technologies and therapies. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, greater focus centers on medical innovations. Theoretically, this dynamic should help MDT stock. Unfortunately, the market blasted it, causing it to shed over 25%. In the trailing five years, MDT slipped 4%. Still, for the contrarian investor, MDT may rank among the blue-chip stocks to buy. Perhaps most enticingly, the market prices MDT at a forward multiple of 14.34. As a discount to earnings, Medtronic ranks better than 87.88% of the medical devices industry. As well, Medtronic trades at 2.02 times its book value. In contrast, the sector median value is 2.75 times.Also, prospective contrarians should note that Medtronic carries a forward yield of 3.49%. As well, it commands 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MDT as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $92.23, implying over 18% upside potential.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)a hand grabbing a prescription from a shelf full of drugsSource: ShutterstockA holding firm that owns the retail pharmacy chain Walgreens in the U.S. and Boots in the U.K., Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) brings natural relevancies to the table. Unfortunately, Walgreens suffered substantial political controversy. Newsweek reports that California Governor Gavin Newsom won’t deal with the enterprise over its stance on reproductive rights. Frankly, I have zero interest in wading into a firebrand topic with which I will never have any direct experience. That said, it’s possible that with the passage of time, cooler heads may prevail, leading to a negotiation. As circumstances stand now, Walgreens offers an undervalued opportunity among speculative blue-chip stocks to buy.Specifically, the market prices WBA at a forward multiple of 7.43. As a discount to earnings, Walgreens ranks better than nearly 96% of the competition. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 5.77%. In addition, it features 47 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg WBA as a consensus hold. Still, their average price target hits $39.75, implying over 19% upside potential.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comA consumer goods giant, Unilever (NYSE:UL) manufactures various products, including food, condiments, bottled water, baby food, soft drink, ice cream, instant coffee, cleaning agents, and toothpaste, among many others. Because of its relevance, UL stock performed well during the trailing year, gaining 10% of equity value. However, in the past five years, it slipped over 7%.Now, that doesn’t sound like much. However, UL currently trades near its five-year low, which presents risks. However, those that want to speculate on underappreciated blue-chip stocks to buy may consider Unilever. For instance, Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) identify UL as modestly undervalued. Operationally, Unilever enjoys a very strong net margin of 12.74%. Also, the company benefits from a zero-debt profile. If that wasn’t enough, UL carries a forward yield of 3.75%. This ranks much higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Looking to the Street, Argus Research believes UL is a buy, forecasting a $60 price target. Should it get there, investors will enjoy over 23% upside.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockA multinational telecommunications giant, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) offers voice, data, and video services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms. Notably, Verizon represented the first company in the world to launch commercial 5G for mobility, fixed wireless and mobile edge computing. Nevertheless, the market has not treated VZ well. Indeed, in the past five years, VZ gave up nearly 25% of its equity value.In full transparency, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that VZ may be a possible value trap. For those that want to take an eventual trip with their blue-chip stocks to buy, the telecom stalwart features some exciting metrics. For example, the market prices VZ at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to earnings, Verizon ranks better than 85.15% of the competition. Despite the downside dangers, it will be difficult for investors to ignore passive income. Right now, Verizon carries a forward yield of 7.14%. Also, it commands 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg VZ as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $46.50, implying over 27% upside potential.Global Payments (GPN)A hand lingers over a bright blue tech wheel that says ""fintech.""Source: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.comA financial technology (fintech) company, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides payment technology and services to merchants, issuers, and consumers. Although relevant during decisively bullish cycles, Global Payments struggled for traction as inflation negatively impacted consumer sentiment. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, GPN gave up over 17% of equity value. In the past five years, it’s down nearly 11%.Nevertheless, it’s quite possible that Global Payments could be one of the deflated blue-chip stocks to buy. Yes, I must state that Gurufocus.com believes it could be a possible value trap. Objectively, though, the market prices GPN at a forward multiple of 10.21. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 75.16% of the field. Operationally, the fintech firm also features attractive attributes. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 9.7%, above 71.47% of the industry. As well, its operating margin pings at 18.63%, beating out nearly 84% of sector players. Turning to the Street, analysts peg GPN as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $139.74, implying nearly 33% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAnother big name in the burgeoning fintech ecosystem, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) specializes in digital payment solutions. As well, the company provides business management software for independent entrepreneurs. With the gig economy rapidly growing in popularity – thanks in no small part to the wider remote operations experiment – PYPL may be one of the best discounted blue-chip stocks to buy.Nevertheless, investors must exercise patience. In the trailing year, PayPal shares tumbled 23%. And in the past five years, they’re down almost 8%. Enticingly, though, Gurufocus.com identifies PYPL as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations.Objectively, PayPal still delivers the goods operationally. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.7%, outpacing 77.53% of the competition. Also, during the same period, its book growth rate pings at 7.4%, above 63% of its peers. Finally, covering analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $111.15, implying over 46% upside potential. Thus, if you can handle the heat, PayPal is one of the blue-chip stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Meanwhile, those working remote-only or for small companies are more likely to suffer a poor onboarding experience.Nearly one-third of employees find the onboarding experience confusing—with this figure rising to 36% for remote workers, who are most likely to feel undertrained, disoriented, and devalued after onboarding, compared to on-site or hybrid workers.It’s why remote employees are 117% more likely than on-site employees to plan to leave their employers soon, according to the research.“Given the large percentage of employees who prefer remote work, companies may want to refine their remote onboarding process to fill in these gaps,” the report suggests.Meanwhile, employees working for small companies are less satisfied with their onboarding than employees in large companies, and more likely to feel undertrained. As such, around two-thirds of those working at smaller companies reported that they plan to leave their employer soon.Story continuesGen Zers, the newest working generation with the least prior experience to compare with, are also the least satisfied with onboarding and most likely to feel undertrained, compared to older cohorts.With this in mind, the report says that human resource departments should keep this potential generational gap in mind when onboarding new hires and consider offering them additional training and on-the-job support.Re-onboarding employeesAccording to the report, these are the top five elements that employees believe would improve the onboarding process:Getting the team involved (22%)Creating an epic welcome (18%)Keeping the process simple (18%)Addressing career development (14%)Assigning a buddy or mentor (12%)But employers who have failed to use any of these elements in their onboarding process are not a lost cause. Not only can employers start making changes to their current process for future joiners, but the report also recommends managers re-onboard their entire workforce.“As organizations look to improve their onboarding process, creating a welcoming, engaging, and clear onboarding experience can vastly improve employee retention and morale,” Alison Stevens, director of HR Services at Paychex told Fortune. “It is equally important to offer longer-term employees a re-onboarding as a retention strategy in order to rejuvenate their work environment and address any individual concerns.”Businesses that fear employees will find the process of being reintroduced to the company’s culture and expectations dull and another long-winded box-ticking exercise needn’t worry; the study actually found that 71% of employees want their employer to conduct a company-wide re-onboarding.And when done correctly, it can be beneficial for both the business and individuals:After re-onboarding, employees' focus reportedly can increase by almost 50%. Over a third of workers also reported feeling more productive, efficient and closer to their team.In another plus for businesses, retention improved by 43% after re-onboarding, which helps reduce the need for hiring in the first place.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -18.7%). The company is facing the heat due to the escalation in fuel costs, as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front.In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+14.0% vs. +7.8%). The company is benefitting from solid global brand recognition supporting which management focuses on increasing global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, and remodeling existing stores.North America comps continue to impress investors. The company also aids from successful menu innovations and digital initiatives along with its exceptional loyalty programs.However, its performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market. Earnings estimate for fiscal 2023 declined in the past 60 days depicting analysts’ concern over its growth prospects.(You can read the full research report on Starbucks here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Duke Energy have underperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (-10.3% vs. -7.8%). The company’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk due to higher technological resource prices. A comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Sales ratio shows a gloomy picture that may concern investors.Nevertheless, Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider which focuses on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities by investing heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects. During the 2023-2027 period, the company plans capital investments of $65 billion. It also plans to expand in the electric vehicle segment.(You can read the full research report on Duke Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Eni S.p.A.

However, high G&amp;A costs may dent margins, per the Zacks analyst.HP (HPQ) Hurt by Declining Demand, High Inventory LevelsPer the Zacks analyst, HP is hurt by declining demand for its consumer and commercial PCs. Also, high inventory levels at channel partners are leading to order delays.Robust Snacks Business Aids Kellogg (K), High Costs a WoePer the Zacks analyst, Kellogg has been benefiting from strength in its world-class snack brands. However, the company is grappling with rising input cost inflation for a while.Rising Investment Income, Acquisitions Aid Owl Rock (ORCC)Per the Zacks analyst, the company's revenues are driven by higher investment income, thanks to its improved interest income. Buyouts enhance its capabilities and diversify the business.Strong Image Processing Chip Demand Aid Ambarella (AMBA)Per the Zacks analyst, strong demand for video compression and image processing chips are aiding Ambarella's growth. Recovery in the automotive market is also a positive.NuVasive's (NUVA) Globus Medical Merger to Aid StrategicallyThe Zacks analyst is pleased with NuVasive's $3.1-billion merger deal with Globus Medical. This will bring together two major players in the musculoskeletal space that is now valued at $50 billion.New UpgradesGovernment Services Group segment Benefits Tetra Tech (TTEK)Per the Zacks analyst, Tetra Tech is benefitting from its Government Services Group Segment, driven by robust water and environmental programs. A strong backlog level will also be beneficial.Robust Investment Banking Arm Aid Evercore (EVR), Costs Up Per the Zacks analyst, strong investment banking business, expansion of geographic footprint and client base will aid Evercore's revenues.

90,b05cbdff-ab8a-3e2d-8e55-8cac20123102,SYY,2023-03-16,When Should You Buy Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-sysco-corporation-nyse-syy-110017959.html,1678964417,STORY,['SYY'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$84.26 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$73.13. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Sysco's current trading price of US$74.98 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Sysco Is Sysco Still Cheap?Sysco is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Sysco’s ratio of 26.8x is above its peer average of 19.81x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Consumer Retailing industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Sysco’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Sysco look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Sysco's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 85%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SYY’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe SYY should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SYY for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for SYY, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Sysco at this point in time.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.7%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.87%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 2.77%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the food distributor had lost 4.01% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 1.52% and was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.06% in that time.Sysco will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Sysco to post earnings of $0.93 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 30.99%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.58 billion, up 9.94% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.04 per share and revenue of $76.4 billion, which would represent changes of +24.31% and +11.31%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Sysco should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.26% lower. Sysco is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Digging into valuation, Sysco currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.5. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.09.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that SYY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Food - Miscellaneous stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.62 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Food - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 106, which puts it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

But what exactly happened, and what stocks can investors buy to avoid the fallout?One way to avoid more carnage is to focus on quality defensive stocks.Silicon Valley BankAs the name suggests, Silicon Valley Bank was an institution that catered primarily to start-ups and venture capitalists, although not exclusively. With the explosion of tech and venture funding that followed the Covid-19 pandemic so too did the growth of Silicon Valley Bank. Between 2019 and 2022 deposits at the bank grew from $60 billion to $190 billion.In response to this massive influx of new deposits, SVIB began to load up on ""safe"" assets. It bought $80 billion of Mortgage-backed securities and long-term Treasury bonds. While these are typically nearly risk-less assets, the bank unfortunately bought the top of the bond market. As interest rates climbed throughout all of 2022, bond prices fell in response, creating paper losses on the bank's portfolio. Additionally, SVIB did very little to try and hedge its interest rate risk.Compounding the issues, deposits started falling rapidly. With the cycle coming to an end, many of the venture backed businesses banking with SVB were losing money or outright failing, drawing down deposits from the bank.To protect against these drops in deposits, the bank began selling some of its bonds at a loss. To manage the losses, SVB attempted a stock offering to raise $2.25 billion. This is where it all went wrong. This unconventional means of filling a liquidity gap spoked investors and eventually depositors.Story continuesIn a single day, on March 9, $42 billion of deposits withdrew and induced a run on the bank. This came primarily in the form of venture investments, as many well-known investors pushed companies to withdraw as soon as possible. Panic ensued and before the end of the day, Friday, the bank had closed preventing further withdrawals.Thankfully, the Fed and Treasury had the whole weekend to figure out a solution. First there were whispers of an auction occurring for the banks' assets, but on Sunday evening the emergency action from the Fed was announced. They would open the Bank Term Funding Program to save the failing institution.The BTFP is an emergency solution allowing banks to borrow funds against their current bond positions. Most importantly, it allows them to borrow against the par value of the bonds, allowing the institutions to avoid realizing any more losses on their bond portfolios.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank marks the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.What Now?This is a tremendous event the full effect of which is still unknown. The situation is still extremely fluid, and although it seems like the largest banks such as J.P. Morgan JPM, and Bank of America BAC are likely safe from contagion they are still selling off. Furthermore, the Regional Bank ETF  was down -11% just yesterday.As tempting as it is for some investors to start scooping up shares of beaten down banks, I am not so confident. While the big banks, and even regional bank stocks may well recover from here it feels too risky to jump in now. I would much prefer to focus on buying defensive stocks in case this issue has legs.Safety StocksIn looking for stocks I think may perform well in a more challenging economic environment I focus on stocks with a high Zacks Rank, an established business, a low P/E, and a decent dividend yield.Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and a reasonable valuation.Trading at 7x one-year forward earnings, Marathon Petroleum is well below its five-year median of 11x and just slightly above the industry average of 6x. It also offers a dividend yield of 2.3%, which has increased by an average of 7% annually over the last five years.Archer Daniels Midland, one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients is another stock that should provide a safe and steady return. ADM has a long history of continual dividend increases, and currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings expectations have been revised higher across all timeframes by as much as 25% over the last 90 days.Additionally, ADM is trading at a very reasonable 11x one-year forward earnings, below its five-year median of 14x, and under the industry average 14x.ASE Technology is a provider of semiconductor manufacturing services for assembly and testing. ASX may not be the most exciting growth stock out there, but it has steady returns, consistent revenue growth, and a dividend yield of 4.9%.ASX is trading at 9x one-year forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 13x and well below the industry average 19x.ASE Technology also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating strongly upward trending earnings revisions.ConclusionThe failure of Silicon Valley Bank is a significant event with unknown and potentially very far-reaching effects. The rising rate environment has begun to show that points of weakness developed during the boom, and this may not be the last case. To remain risk-averse, identifying defensive stocks may be one safe way to trade through this challenging period.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 48% over a half decade. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 31% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 20% in the last three months.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years over which the share price declined, Southwest Airlines' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 30% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 12% compound annual share price fall. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 12% in the twelve months, Southwest Airlines shareholders did even worse, losing 30% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Southwest Airlines better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Southwest Airlines has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

The views were revealed at the 2023 JP Morgan Industrials Conference.High fuel costs are likely to hurt results of these airline companies in first-quarter 2023. Weak demand due to seasonality and reduced capacity may also get reflected in the results.Read the last Airline Roundup here.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 For the first quarter of 2023, United Airlines now anticipates a loss per share of 60 cents-$1.00 against the prior expected band of earnings per share of 50 cents-$1.00 (provided with the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 17). UAL now anticipates first-quarter 2023 total revenue per available seat mile to increase 22-23% year over year (prior view: up almost 25%). The downbeat view is due to weaker demand growth witnessed in January and February 2023 compared to other months.UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), now forecasts first-quarter 2023 average aircraft fuel price per gallon between $3.31 and $3.41 (prior view: $3.19).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2. Spirit Airlines now expects adjusted operating expenses of $1.45-$1.47 billion for the first quarter of 2023 (earlier view: $1.39-$1.40 billion). The adjusted operating margin is expected between -7 and -9%. Fuel gallons consumed are expected to be 143 million in the first quarter. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated in the $3.45-$3.50 band (earlier view was $3.20). The effective tax rate is still expected to be 24%. Available seat miles are anticipated to increase 12.8% from the first-quarter 2022 actuals, compared with 13.2% expected earlier.

JetBlue’s management expects first-quarter 2023 capacity to increase in the 8-9% range. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 2-4%. Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 32-35% range (previous outlook was in the 28-32% band). Average fuel cost per gallon in the March quarter is now estimated to be between $3.50 and $3.60 (earlier guidance: $3.2-$3.35). CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is now expected to increase in the 1-2% range in the March quarter (earlier view hinted at a 2-4% year-over-year rise).Management still expects first-quarter 2023 loss in the range of 35-45 cents per share. For full-year 2023, capacity is expected to increase in the band of 5.5-8.5% from the 2022 actuals. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 1.5-4.5% from the 2022 actuals. Total revenues for 2023 are still forecast to increase year over year in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Management still expects 2023 earnings per share to be between 70 cents and $1.00.4. Due to high fuel costs, Alaska Air’s management trimmed its forecast for first-quarter 2023 adjusted pre-tax margin. The metric is now expected in the -3 to -6% band (earlier range: -1 to -4%). Economic fuel price per gallon for the March quarter is now expected in the $3.35-$3.45 band (earlier forecast: $3.15-$3.35 range). Total revenues are still expected to increase in the 29-32% range year over year. Capacity is still expected to increase in the 11-14% band.5. Southwest Airlines’ management expects to incur a loss in the first quarter mainly due to high costs. Moreover, LUV continues to expect a negative revenue impact in the $300-$350 million band in first-quarter 2023, primarily limited to January and February, due to operational disruptions in December 2022. For first-quarter 2023, operating revenues are now expected to rise in the 21-23% range as opposed to 20-24% year-over-year growth estimated earlier.Available seat miles are still estimated to improve 10% from the year-ago reported figure. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now expected in the $3.1-$3.2 range (earlier expectation: $3.25-$3.35). LUV now expects cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 5.5-6.5% in the first quarter from the comparable period in 2022 (earlier expectation was in the 2-4% range). Approximately 50% of the increase is due to the rise in expenses pertaining to the December 2022 operational disruptions. Interest expenses are still expected to be $65 million in the first quarter.For 2023, LUV expects available seat miles to improve 15-16% from the 2022 level. Economic fuel costs per gallon are estimated between $2.65 and $2.75 (earlier expectation was in the $2.90-$3 band). Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, is anticipated to decrease 3.5-5.5% in 2023 from 2022.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Alaska Air Group has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Southwest Airlines has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). This means that ALK's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ALK currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.33, while LUV has a forward P/E of 11.26. We also note that ALK has a PEG ratio of 0.38. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. LUV currently has a PEG ratio of 0.43.Another notable valuation metric for ALK is its P/B ratio of 1.40. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LUV has a P/B of 1.70.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ALK's Value grade of A and LUV's Value grade of C.ALK has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LUV, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ALK is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds. GSSC has been able to amass assets over $442.31 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Blend. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.32%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.GSSC's heaviest allocation is in the Industrials sector, which is about 18.50% of the portfolio. Its Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Usd U.s. Dollar accounts for about 0.74% of the fund's total assets, followed by Emcor Group Inc (EME) and Atkore Inc (ATKR).Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -1.23% and is down about -8.82% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 03/16/2023), respectively. GSSC has traded between $50.18 and $63.78 during this last 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 28.89% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1261 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks Russell 2000 Index and the iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) tracks S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index. IShares Russell 2000 ETF has $49.23 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF has $65.79 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Blend.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.Credit Suisse (CS) just suffered its worst day on record — sending the stock plummeting 22%. The bank's bonds are also crashing, and investors are paying for insurance on its bonds at rates not seen since the Global Financial Crisis.As investors call into question the solvency of one of Europe's biggest banks, the safety and soundness of the entire global banking system is once again a big question mark for Wall Street. Meanwhile in the U.S., investors are still coming to grips with the fallout from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, sending regional bank stocks down for the seventh time in eight sessions.The once-difficult job now facing Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell and his central banker colleagues just became a seemingly impossible dilemma — continue its fight against inflation by raising rates and tightening credit markets even further, or battle a new banking crisis that poses systemic risk.It's worth remembering that only last week, Fed chair Jay Powell sat in front of Congress and said the Federal Reserve was ""prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" He hedged the statement (as a conservative central banker should), citing the need to consider the ""totality of incoming data.""But the bond market took notice that day, and so did bank stocks. Suddenly, markets were pricing in a 50 basis points (0.5 ppt) March rate hike instead of 25 bps. The U.S. 13-week Treasury-bill yield (^IRX) jumped the most in two months — topping 4.8% for the first time since 2007. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 Select Financial SPDR ETF (XLF) had its worst day in nearly six months, settling at a six-week low.Story continuesFrom there, banks have been caught in a week-long slide that's erased billions in market cap value.Whether or not Powell's visit to the Capitol last week was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, he and his central banker colleagues are facing a monster decision next week with tough choices, and no ideal solution.Raghuram Rajan, Chicago Booth professor of finance and former Reserve Bank of India governor, joined Yahoo Finance Live to explain the difficult choices the Federal Reserve now has with its twin problems of stubborn inflation and banking instability.Rajan says the Fed is likely deciding between a 25 basis point hike and standing pat, leaving rates where they are. (Bond futures are ascribing equal probabilities to both, as of Wednesday afternoon.)""I doubt they will cut,"" says Rajan, who also says a more aggressive hike of 50 bps is probably off the table. ""That would be a pretty hard hike at this point when you have so much fragility,"" adding, ""the question is 25 or zero [basis points].""If the Fed holds short-term rates steady, Rajan expects Powell to downplay investors' perceptions that the Fed is on ""pause"" for several meetings.Historically, the Fed doesn't change direction on interest rate policy too frequently, and market participants might get the impression that future hikes are off the table. That could threaten the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility and its perceived resolve to start hiking rates again if inflation fails to subside.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Rajan says if the Fed doesn't hike, it will protect against this with ""very strong language,"" saying, ""We're not pausing. We're just taking a break, looking at how the markets settled down,"" adding that the Fed would leave the window open to resume tightening.Conversely, if the Fed raises by 25 bps, that indicates the Fed is still concerned about inflation and the need to slow down the economy. However, this option risks freezing credit markets further and deepening the cracks in the financial system. (Remember what happened when Powell simply talked a hawkish game last week.)It might seem non-intuitive, but the Fed can still theoretically achieve its goal of tamping down inflation by not moving short-term rates next week. First, picture a business owner or C-suite executive observing the current troubles in the banking sector. Many will see a recession on the horizon and decide to lay off workers, which slows the economy.""The financial sector turmoil will do part of the Fed's work. Now, that's not the ideal way to get the Fed's work done. But it can be part of [it],"" says Rajan. If the Fed believes the crisis is bad enough to do its dirty work, that would lean the Fed towards zero, he explains.""This is all up in the air [and] very confusing,"" says Rajan.Bottom line, it's a big dilemma.If the Fed doesn't move, it risks damaging its hard-won inflation-fighting credibility in the middle of the battle.If the Fed hikes, it could exacerbate the worsening credit market conditions, contaminating the ""productive"" areas of the economy.At least Powell has another week to digest the developing situations both domestically and abroad.

105,881c8400-1d7a-3a83-bae5-81d1107ed198,GS,2023-03-16,"Analysis-For Goldman Sachs, SVB's botched stock sale had a silver lining",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-goldman-sachs-svbs-botched-050844368.html,1678943324,STORY,"['GS', 'SIVB', 'GSBD']","[By Echo Wang, Lananh Nguyen and David FrenchNEW YORK (Reuters) - As SVB Financial Group wrestled with a capital shortfall and the prospect of a downgrade to its credit rating last week, it went to Goldman Sachs Group Inc and worked out an unusual two-part plan, according to people familiar with the discussions.The investment bank would buy a $21.5 billion bond portfolio from SVB to boost its coffers, after startups began pulling their deposits from the technology-focused lender, which does business as Silicon Valley Bank.But there was a hitch. Goldman's offer for the portfolio was worth $1.8 billion less than the book value SVB had assigned to it, because a rise in interest rates had made it less valuable. SVB would have to book a loss on the portfolio, which comprised U.S. Treasuries and related bonds.The next step was for Goldman to put together a solution. It would help organize a $2.25 billion stock sale for SVB to fill the funding gap caused by the bond portfolio sale, two of the sources said.Goldman delivered on only the first step of that plan. Once the bond portfolio deal was completed, the storied investment bank didn't have time to convince investors to lock in capital and overcome concerns about depositors pulling money out of SVB.The tight turnaround left insufficient time to prepare materials for investors by early last week, one of the sources said. The stock sale collapsed and SVB became the largest U.S. bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis, fueling concern about other lenders and prompting regulatory interventions to backstop customer deposits.Yet for Goldman, the botched deal had a silver lining. The bond portfolio it acquired from SVB is now worth more, based on the drop in Treasury yields since the transaction happened. Traders not affiliated with the deal that were interviewed by Reuters estimated the gain in value to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. A source familiar with details of a hedge that Goldman's trading desk put on the deal said the gain would be less than $100 million.Story continuesIt is unclear whether Goldman has held onto all or part of the bond portfolio or sold it. Goldman declined to comment. SVB did not respond to a request for comment. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, SVB said its bond portfolio sales to Goldman were done at ""negotiated prices"".Goldman was not paid the underwriting fee it had agreed for the stock sale because that deal fell through, two of the sources said. SVB has not disclosed how much that fee would have been.Details provided by six people familiar with the attempted capital raise show that Goldman and SVB underestimated the challenges of pulling off the capital raise in terms of timing and investor interest. Only two private equity firms were ultimately invited to participate in the capital raise last week - General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus. SVB and Goldman hoped stock market investors would chip in for the remainder, four of the sources said.Warburg Pincus turned down the deal, however, because it needed more time to carry out due diligence after it became concerned that SVB could still face long-term funding issues, two of the sources said. General Atlantic pledged $500 million, but walked away when the capital raise fell through.Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic declined to comment.The banks also miscalculated how investors would react to the stock sale. One of the sources said the company believed that investors would welcome the plan as a boon to SVB's financial health, but it backfired and instead sent a worrying signal that triggered a 60% plunge in the bank's shares. The mood of investors was already tense after another bank advised by Goldman, cryptocurrency-focused bank Silvergate Capital Corp, collapsed the day before.The handling of the SVB deal by Goldman, the most prolific dealmaker based on league table data, has attracted Wall Street's fascination and invited scrutiny.Michael Ohlrogge, associate professor at the New York University School of Law, said that while Goldman may not have handled everything ""exactly right"", it had taken on a difficult assignment to begin with. ""(SVB) had gotten themselves into such a risky position,"" Ohlrogge said.UNDISCLOSED ROLESVB did not disclose in its stock sale prospectus to investors that Goldman was the acquirer of the bond portfolio it sold at a loss. But in the prospectus, SVB did mention other relationships and potential conflicts of interest, such as SVB's investment banking arm underwriting the deal.SVB disclosed Goldman's role as acquirer of the bond portfolio only on Tuesday, the last day of a four-business day window that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) affords companies to make such disclosures. Five securities lawyers interviewed by Reuters said that SVB's handling of the disclosure appeared to comply with the rules.An SEC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Echo Wang in Washington, D.C. and Lananh Nguyen and David French in New York; Additional reporting by Davide Barbuscia and Anirban Sen in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Christopher Cushing)]"

To be sure, a few advantages exist in targeting this sector over a lesser-capitalized fare. First, let’s discuss the obvious: blue-chip stocks to buy undergird popular if not relevant businesses. Therefore, it’s much easier for these stalwarts to convince retail investors to take a shot at them as opposed to no-name organizations.Second, the popularity of blue-chip stocks to buy commands far greater attention than random market ideas trading over the counter. Put another way, CNBC could do a piece on the troubled giant, thus potentially attracting an army of contrarians. Third, for blue chips, their current volatility may not be their first rodeo. Thus, they may have a framework from which to recover. Finally, before moving on, all of these securities trade within a range of 20% up from their five-year lows. With that, below are the blue-chip stocks to buy for contrarian investors.INTCIntel$27.22MDTMedtronic$76.72WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$33.26ULUnilever$48.74VZVerizon$36.68GPNGlobal Payments$100.00PYPLPayPal$73.43InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockOne of the semiconductor and technology firms in the world, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) organically commands significant respect. However, a series of sector challenges – most notably intense competition – and unforced errors took the sheen off Intel’s reputation. Unfortunately, the unusual troubles attracted the bears, who proceeded to beat up INTC. In the trailing five years, it’s down over 48%.Nevertheless, INTC could make up the ranks of severely deflated blue-chip stocks to buy. On paper, the company presents an undervalued profile. For example, the market prices INTC at a trailing multiple of 13.49. As a discount to earnings, Intel ranks better than 63% of the competition. Also, INTC trades at a trailing-year sales multiple of 1.73. In contrast, the sector median value is a lofty 2.44 times. As well, Intel features a price-to-book ratio of 1.08 times, below roughly 84% of the semiconductor industry. To be fair, Wall Street analysts peg INTC as a hold. Still, their average price target of $27.31 at least implies positive growth from the time of writing.Story continuesMedtronic (MDT)An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patientSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.comAn American medical device company, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) develops and manufactures healthcare technologies and therapies. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, greater focus centers on medical innovations. Theoretically, this dynamic should help MDT stock. Unfortunately, the market blasted it, causing it to shed over 25%. In the trailing five years, MDT slipped 4%. Still, for the contrarian investor, MDT may rank among the blue-chip stocks to buy. Perhaps most enticingly, the market prices MDT at a forward multiple of 14.34. As a discount to earnings, Medtronic ranks better than 87.88% of the medical devices industry. As well, Medtronic trades at 2.02 times its book value. In contrast, the sector median value is 2.75 times.Also, prospective contrarians should note that Medtronic carries a forward yield of 3.49%. As well, it commands 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MDT as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $92.23, implying over 18% upside potential.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)a hand grabbing a prescription from a shelf full of drugsSource: ShutterstockA holding firm that owns the retail pharmacy chain Walgreens in the U.S. and Boots in the U.K., Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) brings natural relevancies to the table. Unfortunately, Walgreens suffered substantial political controversy. Newsweek reports that California Governor Gavin Newsom won’t deal with the enterprise over its stance on reproductive rights. Frankly, I have zero interest in wading into a firebrand topic with which I will never have any direct experience. That said, it’s possible that with the passage of time, cooler heads may prevail, leading to a negotiation. As circumstances stand now, Walgreens offers an undervalued opportunity among speculative blue-chip stocks to buy.Specifically, the market prices WBA at a forward multiple of 7.43. As a discount to earnings, Walgreens ranks better than nearly 96% of the competition. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 5.77%. In addition, it features 47 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg WBA as a consensus hold. Still, their average price target hits $39.75, implying over 19% upside potential.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comA consumer goods giant, Unilever (NYSE:UL) manufactures various products, including food, condiments, bottled water, baby food, soft drink, ice cream, instant coffee, cleaning agents, and toothpaste, among many others. Because of its relevance, UL stock performed well during the trailing year, gaining 10% of equity value. However, in the past five years, it slipped over 7%.Now, that doesn’t sound like much. However, UL currently trades near its five-year low, which presents risks. However, those that want to speculate on underappreciated blue-chip stocks to buy may consider Unilever. For instance, Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) identify UL as modestly undervalued. Operationally, Unilever enjoys a very strong net margin of 12.74%. Also, the company benefits from a zero-debt profile. If that wasn’t enough, UL carries a forward yield of 3.75%. This ranks much higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Looking to the Street, Argus Research believes UL is a buy, forecasting a $60 price target. Should it get there, investors will enjoy over 23% upside.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockA multinational telecommunications giant, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) offers voice, data, and video services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms. Notably, Verizon represented the first company in the world to launch commercial 5G for mobility, fixed wireless and mobile edge computing. Nevertheless, the market has not treated VZ well. Indeed, in the past five years, VZ gave up nearly 25% of its equity value.In full transparency, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that VZ may be a possible value trap. For those that want to take an eventual trip with their blue-chip stocks to buy, the telecom stalwart features some exciting metrics. For example, the market prices VZ at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to earnings, Verizon ranks better than 85.15% of the competition. Despite the downside dangers, it will be difficult for investors to ignore passive income. Right now, Verizon carries a forward yield of 7.14%. Also, it commands 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg VZ as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $46.50, implying over 27% upside potential.Global Payments (GPN)A hand lingers over a bright blue tech wheel that says ""fintech.""Source: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.comA financial technology (fintech) company, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides payment technology and services to merchants, issuers, and consumers. Although relevant during decisively bullish cycles, Global Payments struggled for traction as inflation negatively impacted consumer sentiment. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, GPN gave up over 17% of equity value. In the past five years, it’s down nearly 11%.Nevertheless, it’s quite possible that Global Payments could be one of the deflated blue-chip stocks to buy. Yes, I must state that Gurufocus.com believes it could be a possible value trap. Objectively, though, the market prices GPN at a forward multiple of 10.21. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 75.16% of the field. Operationally, the fintech firm also features attractive attributes. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 9.7%, above 71.47% of the industry. As well, its operating margin pings at 18.63%, beating out nearly 84% of sector players. Turning to the Street, analysts peg GPN as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $139.74, implying nearly 33% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAnother big name in the burgeoning fintech ecosystem, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) specializes in digital payment solutions. As well, the company provides business management software for independent entrepreneurs. With the gig economy rapidly growing in popularity – thanks in no small part to the wider remote operations experiment – PYPL may be one of the best discounted blue-chip stocks to buy.Nevertheless, investors must exercise patience. In the trailing year, PayPal shares tumbled 23%. And in the past five years, they’re down almost 8%. Enticingly, though, Gurufocus.com identifies PYPL as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations.Objectively, PayPal still delivers the goods operationally. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.7%, outpacing 77.53% of the competition. Also, during the same period, its book growth rate pings at 7.4%, above 63% of its peers. Finally, covering analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $111.15, implying over 46% upside potential. Thus, if you can handle the heat, PayPal is one of the blue-chip stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to American International Group's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for American International Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:27% = US$11b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.27.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 27% ROETo begin with, American International Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, American International Group's considerable five year net income growth of 61% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then compared American International Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AIG? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is American International Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?American International Group has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 9.7%, meaning that it has the remaining 90% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, American International Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 22% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 11% over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that American International Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

SWAV recently announced the full U.S. commercial availability of the Shockwave L6 Peripheral Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) Catheter. This follows the receipt of the FDA’s clearance for the same.The Shockwave L6 will likely enhance the company’s peripheral IVL portfolio, extending the size offerings of the Shockwave M5+ and Shockwave S4 catheters. This is expected to provide physicians with a choice of catheters optimized for the challenges of infrapopliteal, femoropopliteal and iliac arterial territories.The latest commercial availability is expected to aid Shockwave Medical in significantly expanding its footprint in the Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) treatment space and solidifying its position nationwide.Significance of the LaunchThe Shockwave L6 catheter has been designed to modify calcification in otherwise difficult-to-treat lesions in large peripheral vessels, including the iliac and the common femoral arteries. Calcification in these arteries is common and associated with decreased procedural success and increased complications with standard endovascular techniques. The Shockwave L6 IVL catheter’s compact emitter configuration, in conjunction with four new device sizes, will likely enable the effective delivery of sonic pressure waves in larger vessels.Per an expert familiar with the Shockwave L6 catheter, the product allows physicians to optimize IVL therapy in large peripheral vessels, which represent approximately more than 20% of peripheral interventions performed in the United States every year. The catheter may also be beneficial when IVL is used to facilitate transfemoral access for large bore procedures (like transcatheter aortic valve replacements) to minimize the risks of rupture and dissection.Per Shockwave Medical’s management, the successful limited release and the positive feedback received from customers have led the company to look forward to offering the Shockwave L6 as an additional IVL option for the most complex and high-risk large vessel cases.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global PAD market was estimated to be $3,524.77 million in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $5,715.12 million by 2027 at a CAGR of 8.5%. Factors like rapid growth in the elderly population and subsequent increase in the prevalence of PAD cases, and a rising number of people suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest commercial availability is expected to provide a significant boost to Shockwave Medical’s business across the United States.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Shockwave Medical announced its fourth-quarter 2022 results, where it registered a solid uptick in its top line. During the quarter, the company received the FDA’s approval for the Shockwave C2+ Coronary IVL Catheter in the United States and was also granted increased reimbursement for the Shockwave C2 Coronary IVL Catheter by the German INEK institute.In January, the company announced that coronary IVL was included in a treatment guidance document published by the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention as a potential therapeutic option in all U.S. catheterization labs, including facilities without on-site surgical backup.In the same month, it announced its entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Neovasc Inc.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 20.8% in the past year against the industry’s 14.4% fall and the S&amp;P 500's 11.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Shockwave Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its solid international exposure is expected to contribute further. However, headwinds related to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 9.5% against an 8.5% decline of the industry and an 11.5% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical devices provider has a market capitalization of $3.95 billion. The company projects 11% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 19.3% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s continued gains on the back of significant momentum of new products. We are also optimistic about the company’s product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products. This month, the company announced the launch of the SCOUT Mini Reflector, which has been designed for use in soft tissues, such as breast and lymph nodes.In February, Merit Medical announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Device Designation for the SCOUT MD Surgical Guidance System.International Exposure: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s current global operations, including its territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Mexico, and Canada. At the end of 2022, Merit Medical confirmed that its international sales (43.5% of net sales) improved 7.4% from the corresponding period of 2021. This included increased sales of 5.9% in APAC operations, 30.8% in Rest of the World operations and 5.5% in EMEA operations.Strong Q4 Results: Merit Medical’s robust fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company registered a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. Revenue growth in its Cardiovascular segment and across the majority of its product categories within its Cardiovascular unit was also recorded. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen.Story continuesDownsidesHigher Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies.This enables the availability of healthcare products at low prices in the market. Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions on its products, which acts against its ongoing business strategies.

Looked at another way, Netflix's stock has tanked 9.3% since the pricing announcement compared to a 2.5% drop for the S&amp;P 500.The company slashed prices by 50% in about 100 smaller overseas markets such as Slovenia and Jordan, representing 6% of its subscriber base, according to Citi research. Roughly 60% of the markets were in Europe and the Middle East and Africa region, while 20% each came in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America.Citi analyst Jason Bazinet thinks the price cuts reflect the pending ""global enforcement of password sharing."" By lowering prices, Bazinet says, Netflix may be aligning the retail price of a subscription with the utility each user derives from the service.Whatever the reason, Bazinet believes Netflix's decision isn't sitting well with investors as it could weigh on profit margins and free cash flow.""We believe such dramatic price reductions across so many markets confused the Street,"" Bazinet says.

Could this be the time to buy? Joining us is Jason Helfstein, managing director and head of internet research at Oppenheimer and Company. And Jason, you have an outperform rating on Netflix. You find this to be an attractive entry point, why?JASON HELFSTEIN: We do. So a few numbers to share. So the stock was up 20% after reporting fourth quarter earnings versus the NASDAQ up 11, as they were able to tell a solid subscriber story in kind of that they still had further to grow. Meanwhile, the stock is now off 22% versus the NASDAQ down 7%. It's already the middle of March. At this point, it does not look like they're launching page sharing this quarter. So this quarter, we would expect just subs probably to be better than expected. But from-- we're actually not concerned with page sharing because we think it's actually going to improve revenue.SEANA SMITH: How big of a boost, Jason, do you it will be to revenue?JASON HELFSTEIN: So we've done sensitivity work that it could be anywhere from $2 to $8 billion of incremental revenue, which is something like 6% to 23% of our current estimate this year. I think there's a debate of will-- if somebody gets upset that they're asked to pay a higher fee, what tier will they go to. Part of the way the company is doing this is, you're going to have to pay more for HD.And so if you've been borrowing somebody's Netflix password for the last five years or longer, and you've been watching HD, and you kind of end up, let's say, in the ad tier on more of a basic definition, 720, we think there's a higher likelihood that you will actually opt for the more expensive plan, especially if you've got a larger fully HD television.Story continuesAnd then secondly, we think people, or in my case, for example, am I really going to kick off my college age son or my mother? Because they don't live in my household-- over $5 a month, which is kind of what we're going to see. So we think the company has been looking at this for years. They purposely made Netflix the easiest service to share and built a tremendous amount of loyalty from viewing and the shows that they have. And so we just think investors are too pessimistic about how this will play out.INES FERRE: Jason, you mentioned the ad tier offering. And I will confess, I actually signed up for that ad tier offering because I wanted to watch one documentary. And it was so annoying to go through those ads because when I tried to click on to a different browser when the ads came on, the ad stopped. So you had to actually watch it. And I thought, this is not worth it. So given this sort of anecdote that I just mentioned and what you were just talking about, the ad tier, do you find that it will be annoying for people to have the ad tier offering and that they will want to upgrade?JASON HELFSTEIN: Oh, well, we clearly see that paid commercial streaming has been very popular, right? But what we're also seeing is that if you want to kind cover all of basically TV viewing households, there are a percent of TV viewing households who can't afford to pay for all of these services and so kind of don't have a choice. Now, look, you can upgrade from $7 a month to $10 a month. So for $3 more a month, definitely less expensive than typical Starbucks, you can avoid the ads.So we don't think-- for most consumers, if they really find the ads annoying, they'll pay the extra $3. You have a lot of consumers who said ads are OK. Now, look, it's super early. And Netflix should be able to have very targeted ads. And there's a lot of data that suggests that as long as the ads are targeted and relevant, consumers don't hate them. And they also don't want too many, right, as we're thinking about where we're coming from linear TV.So you've got to think of that perspective. The perspective is for people who haven't had per se Netflix in the past. They've been watching 22 ads an hour on linear TV, right? And we're going to whatever this is going to be, four ads an hour, six ads an hour. We don't know where this is going to shake out, but it's going to be a lot less than linear. And presumably, they're going to be targeted because they know who you are, right? Where linear TV, if you're watching on a cable box, doesn't necessarily know who you are. And then if you still don't like that, you can pay $3 more a month and have it ad-free.SEANA SMITH: There's always the option to upgrade there, Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, I know.SEANA SMITH: Maybe they're going to get you to do that soon. Jason, let's talk about competition and what Netflix is up against because there's been lots of talk, especially over the last couple of quarters, about M&amp;A in this space. There will only be a handful of winners within streaming. Are you part of that? Do you buy that?JASON HELFSTEIN: Yeah, look, we think it's more of on that and we don't formally cover the big media stocks. We just cover internet stocks. But we do think there'll probably be more consolidation on the media company side. And it does get tricky because when you own broadcast television stations, there are government regulations on how many you can own. But we do think that you'll probably see further consolidation some of this does depend also who's in the White House and how friendly the administration is to consolidation, which the current administration is not particularly favorable to M&amp;A right now.But yes, there's probably too many services, and they need to get bundled. You're already basically seeing HBO and Showtime, right, being bundled with their parent company services. The narrative that the big media companies are all putting out is that they need to get streaming to become profitable sooner. It's just too big of a profit drag, especially when they're trying to manage the impact of inflation and the current environment we're going through.You're probably still going to see content spending up this year. Only really Disney talked about lower content spend. But we do think you're going to see less marketing spend by all the companies. I'll also cite if you look at some of the engagement data, Netflix is down versus the fourth quarter on engagement metrics, but it's consistent with the trailing six quarters. So a little-- so not as good as the fourth quarter, but we think plenty good to keep consumers engaged.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Netflix closing up today, up just about 3%, bucking that downward trend that we certainly saw in the broader markets. Jason Helfstein, great to have you. Thanks.]"

TJX’s business model is to sell brand name and designer merchandise in limited quantities at every day discounted prices in stores with flexible, low-cost layouts. Its strategy is to tap into shoppers’ psychological need to “treasure hunt,” as the company describes it, to find unique, branded items at deep discounts. TJX buyers opportunistically purchase merchandise from vendors at deep discounts to keep the cost of goods low for stores.

Both instruments were up nearly 2.6% so far this week.The dollar recovered sharply against a basket of currencies in overnight trade, while Treasury yields also rose as markets gauged the potential for more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.While fears of a banking crisis spurred bets that the Fed will lack enough economic headroom to raise rates, signs of sticky core consumer inflation showed that the Fed may still consider maintaining its hawkish rhetoric.Fed Fund futures prices show that markets are pricing in a 54.6% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points next week. But there also stands a 45.4% chance that the bank will stand pat on rates.Gold stands to benefit from any pauses in the Fed’s rate-hike cycle, given that it increases the yellow metal’s appeal against the dollar, and also puts a cap on the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Rising interest rates had battered metal markets through 2022, and are likely to limit a recovery in the space this year.Story continuesOther precious metals also retreated from recent highs on Thursday. Platinum futures fell 0.1% to $966.05 an ounce, while silver futures fell 0.3% to $21.808 an ounce.Among industrial metals, copper prices were muted, but were nursing steep losses this week amid growing fears that a banking crisis will crimp economic activity this year, hurting demand for the industry-exposed metal.Copper futures were flat at $3.8850 a pound, and were down nearly 4% this week.Related ArticlesGold slips from 6-week high, but bank crisis underpins demandOil rises from 15-mth low on China hopes, bank crisis fears persistOil slumps nearly 5% to lowest in more than a year as banking fears mount]"

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General DynamicsThe Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$228 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$217. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Gregory Gallopoulos.Gregory Gallopoulos divested 21.77k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$233.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. General Dynamics insiders own about US$3.7b worth of shares (which is 6.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Dynamics Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of General Dynamics, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

LVS, Wynn Resorts, Ltd. WYNN and Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD.Industry: GamingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2065309/3-stocks-to-buy-from-a-flourishing-gaming-industryThe Zacks Gaming industry is benefiting from improving visitation. The industry is gaining from positive momentum in Macau's gaming revenues. Robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry. The expansion of online betting offerings bodes well. Stocks like Las Vegas Sands Corp., Wynn Resorts, Ltd. and Boyd Gaming Corp. are likely to gain traction from this upbeat demand.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Gaming industry includes companies that primarily own and operate integrated casinos, hotels and entertainment resorts. Some industry players also deliver technology products and services across lotteries, electronic gaming machines, sports betting and interactive gaming. Some industry participants further develop and operate gaming establishments and associated lodging, restaurant, horse racing and entertainment amenities.Some companies are also involved in developing and selling gaming applications. Additionally, e-sport or sporting event or tournament services, content management systems, video software, mobile applications and e-sports data platform solutions are provided.Key Themes Shaping the Gaming IndustryVisitation Improving: The industry is benefiting from improving visitation. In February, Macau's gross gaming revenue (GGR) jumped 33.1% year over year to MOP$10.32 billion (US$1.27 billion). For the first two months of February, GGR surged 55.3% year over year. The director of the Institute for the Study of Commercial Gaming (under the University of Macau), Davis Fong, estimates that Macau's GGR is likely to be between MOP130 billion ($16 billion) and MOP150 billion ($18.5 billion) in 2023, which is 44.5-50% of 2019 levels.Story continuesCompanies continue to focus on the level of services, staffing with selective amenities and enhanced safety and social-distancing protocols on the gaming floor to welcome gamers. Nevertheless, the easing of restrictions and investment will boost gaming revenues in Macau. In the next 10 years, six casino companies will invest nearly $15 billion.U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenues Make Record: The gaming industry in the United States is recovering faster than anticipated. Per the American Gaming Association data, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $60.42 billion in 2022. In 2022, sports betting increased 72.7% year over year. Gambling was already flourishing in the United States until the pandemic struck in early 2020. The U.S. gaming industry will continue to improve. Sports Betting a Major Driver:  The legalization of sports betting in Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Montana, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois and New Hampshire has been driving growth for a while. Bettors can now place wagers via digital platforms in Connecticut, Kentucky, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, California, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and other states. Some popular gaming applications include DraftKings, Barstool, FanDuel, BetMGM, BetRivers, Fox Bet and BetMonarch.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #56, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since Jan 31, 2023, the industry's northbound estimate for the current year has increased 1,100%.Industry Outperforms Sector and the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Gaming industry has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 Index and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector over the past year.The industry has gained 7.8% over this period against the S&amp;P 500 Index's decline of 11% and the sector's decrease of 19.2%.Gaming Industry's Valuation Since gaming companies are debt-laden, valuing the same based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio makes sense. The industry currently has a forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.53. The space is trading at a discount compared to the market at large, as the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 19.71.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.60X and as low as 6.82X, with a median of 10.6X.3 Zacks Gaming Stocks to WatchLas Vegas Sands: Based in Las Vegas, NV, Las Vegas Sands is a leading international developer of multi-use integrated resorts. The company is benefitting from solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations. The company is optimistic about Macau's recovery on the back of resilient customer demand and spending.Shares of this presently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) player have increased 71.3% in the past year. Moreover, LVS's 2023 earnings and sales are anticipated to increase 217.5% and 107.7% each from the respective year-ago reported figures.

What Went Wrong?NRG Energy Inc., Vistra Corp. and Calpine Corp. increased the costs for households and businesses to get power from August 2021 to July 2022, the Public Utility Commission of Texas said in filings Wednesday. The companies are not accused of wrongdoing. Nor do they face any fines or penalties.Widespread power failures triggered deadly blackouts in February 2021, causing the state grid to start procuring more fast-starting supplies to prevent further shortages. The companies, which own the biggest share of fossil fuel and nuclear generation in the state, grew in influence as this happened, the regulator said.“NRG has not been accused of market power abuse by the PUC, nor is NRG under investigation for market abuse,” company spokeswoman Laura Avant said in an email.Vistra’s “conduct has been lawful at all times” and the company amended its agreement with the PUC, with the support of the market monitor, in response to changes in market conditions, spokeswoman Meranda Cohn said in an email.Calpine also pointed to the change in market dynamics and spokesman Brett Kerr said the company is “not under investigation, nor has Calpine been accused with regards to anything related to the filing made today,” according to an email.Read more: Texas Power Costs Hit Record $79.7 Billion on Deadly 2021 StormIt’s a rare move by the Texas regulator against power generators wielding influence on the state grid, which transports electricity from plants to consumers. The grid, run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, has been operating conservatively, procuring excess power supplies to avoid a repeat of widespread shortages during the winter storm more than two years ago.Story continuesThe ability for certain suppliers of grid services “to effectively control the price” caused the price of those reserves “to exceed competitive levels,” tacking on between $285 million to $380 million over the course of the year, according to a filing.The PUC’s comments underscore the state’s mounting challenge of making sure the market is competitive while also helping consumers get the power they need as more extreme storms and a fast moving transition to renewable resources put stress on the system.The companies have signed contracts with the commission that gives them an “absolute defense” any allegations of market manipulation. As part of the Wednesday findings, the commission amended those protections for Calpine and Vistra and terminated some parts of the protections for NRG. All three companies agreed to change their contracts.“The amendment further enables the market monitor for the state grid to investigate should concerns arise,” NRG spokeswoman Avant said. “NRG agrees with this amendment and, as such, did not negotiate changes with the PUC.”(Updates with Calpine comment in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyNaples, Florida, Is Getting So Expensive That City Workers Can't Afford It72 Hours in Washington: How the Frenzied SVB Rescue Took ShapeDrugs in Orbit: One Startup’s Big Idea for MicrogravityGlencore CEO Rides Coal Windfall on the Way to a Low-Carbon World©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

In addition, the wider changes in the global economy pinpoint certain market ideas that may stand the test of time.So, if you’re interested in building a robust retirement, these are compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors.WMWaste Management$149.33IBMIBM.$125.45RIORio Tinto$78.59CVXChevron$159.67CAGConagra$35.01PFEPfizer$39.39NEENextEra Energy$73.01InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWaste Management (WM)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRToo often, people seeking the most compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors target enterprises that bring accretive value to society. And of course, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) makes for an intriguing idea because somebody has to deal with all the waste products that individuals and corporate entities create. In other words, WM most likely represents a permanently relevant market idea.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Waste Management is modestly undervalued. Objectively, though, the company’s greatest strengths center on its operational attributes. For example, WM’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 9.5%, outpacing 60% of sector peers. In terms of profitability, the enterprise features a net margin of 11.36%, above 74.19% of the industry. Also, it’s worth noting that the firm’s return on equity (ROE) is 31.68%, dominating the sector. It also signifies an extremely high-quality business. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg WM as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $165.60, implying 10% upside potential.Story continuesIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVTo be frank, legacy technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn’t offer the most exciting investment. However, as one of the compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors, it more than holds its own. In recent years, management made a concerted effort to lean off less-relevant endeavors for contemporary solutions such as cloud computing. As well, it’s made forays into genuinely exciting sectors such as blockchain and machine learning.While IBM’s financials could use some shoring up, at the moment, it makes for an enticing market idea. For example, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 13.2. As a discount to earnings, “Big Blue” ranks better than 80.62% of the competition. In addition, the company benefits from an ROE of 8.25%, outpacing 62.68% of its peers. Also, it’s well worth mentioning that IBM carries a forward yield of 5.23%. Plus, it features 29 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg IBM as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $143.56, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Rio Tinto (RIO)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comOver the next few decades, it’s quite possible that auto manufacturers may make conspicuous inroads into the electrification of mobility. However, what’s not so clear is which brand will end up dominating the electric vehicle market. Sure, everyone wants to say the T-word. However, no one has a lock on what might happen 20 to 30 years down the road. But that’s the beauty behind Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).If you’re looking for investment opportunities for beginning investors, RIO deserves more than a second look. As a metal and mining stalwart, Rio Tinto specializes in several key commodities. However, for EVs, their lithium and copper units should perform very well. Throw in some geopolitical tensions and competition and RIO can truly fly. Not only that, RIO offers an undervalued opportunity. Presently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 9.09. As a discount to earnings, Rio ranks better than 62.35% of the mining industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg RIO as a consensus hold. Still, their average price target hits $79.27, implying over 16% upside potential.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAs one of the world’s top hydrocarbon specialists, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) does not initially appear as a viable candidate for investment opportunities for beginning investors. After all, I just got done talking about EVs and their implications for the future of transportation. However, it’s also wise to hedge against this grandiose wager. Frankly, it’s not guaranteed that EVs will take over. For one thing, EVs remain expensive for the average-income household. Yes, economies of scale may address this conundrum. But it’s also possible that the cost profile might not shrink fast enough. Second, EVs may remain inconvenient regarding quick-charging capabilities unless some radical invention materializes.For those that don’t believe in the electrification narrative, Chevron offers an operationally robust and profitable enterprise. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 3.76% with a relatively low payout ratio of 41.4%. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target pings at $189.69, implying over 18% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhile no guarantees exist in the capital markets, over time, it’s almost a sure thing that Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) will be a relevant enterprise for many years to come. A consumer-packaged goods holding company, Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names. These products find themselves in supermarkets, restaurants, and food-service establishments.Put another way, no matter what happens in future economic cycles, people got to eat. This obvious framework should keep the lights on at Conagra. Even better, the market prices CAG at a forward multiple of 12.34. As a discount to earnings, the food giant ranks better than 67.87% of sector peers. Regarding passive income, Conagra carries a forward yield of 3.76%. As well, the payout ratio sits at 47%, symbolizing confidence in yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CAG as a moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $41.70, implying nearly 19% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors.Pfizer (PFE)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comA world-renowned pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) makes for an intriguing candidate for investment opportunities for beginning investors. Naturally, during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, Pfizer gained considerable attention for forwarding a vaccine. However, with Covid-19 fears fading into the background, PFE lost its relevance. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled by 23%.Here’s the thing – Pfizer never lost its scientific relevance. In addition, with its acumen in messenger-RNA-based vaccines, it could potentially forward other significant medical advancements. It’s not just an upside catalyst for the Covid crisis. Indeed, the market prices PFE at a forward multiple of 11.5. In contrast, the sector median value pings at 16.65. Beyond that, Pfizer carries an attractive forward yield of 4.16%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PFE as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $49.67, implying nearly 26% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockProbably one of the most obvious ideas for investment opportunities for beginning investors, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy stalwart. While the broader political ecosystem has been gradually pushing toward renewables, the military conflict in eastern Europe accelerated this initiative. With Russia’s hydrocarbon supplies largely offline for western nations, they will need to find workable solutions.Over time, many climate advocates hope for a completely green energy infrastructure. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure we’ll get there. However, in the meantime, plenty of politically motivated funds will move into this space. Therefore, NEE should be one of the intriguing investment opportunities for beginning investors. Financially, NextEra’s greatest strength arguably lies in its profitability metrics. For instance, the company’s net margin pings at 19.79%, outpacing 85% of the competition. Lastly, covering analysts peg NEE as a consensus (and unanimous) strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $94.55, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(SPGI). The company is also accelerating the pace of its innovation and expects profitable growth in the near future. The company is diversifying from its rating division and the same has been reflected in the recent fourth-quarter earnings.The company reported impressive fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings per share (excluding $1.21 from non-recurring items) of $2.54 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.8% but decreased 19.4% year over year. Revenues of $2.94 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.5% and improved 40.6% year over year, backed by strength in every segment, except the Ratings division.S&amp;P Global Inc. Revenue (TTM) S&amp;P Global Inc. Revenue (TTM)S&amp;P Global Inc. revenue-ttm | S&amp;P Global Inc. Quote Despite pressure posed by inflation and a dramatic drop in debt issuance, SPGI has managed to grow banking on its cost synergies, timing and prioritizing of strategic investments. The company is taking steps to optimize its operations, portfolio and capital structure.S&amp;P Global is continuously making small but impactful acquisitions to enhance the offering in private markets, sustainability and energy transition products. The company plans to continue such strategic organic investments and opportunistic acquisitions to increase growth and innovation.The company has recently entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services which allows it to consolidate contracts and fetch long-term savings through a collaborative partnership. The partnership between SPGI and AMZN is expected to bring strategic cooperation to better serve customers by developing new products.The company has been continuing its shareholder-friendly attitude and rewarding its investors with a 16.9% hike in the recent dividend declaration, supported by a strong free cash flow in 2022 amounting to $1,012 million. The shareholder-friendly policies not only increase investors’ confidence in the stock but also has a positive impact on the demand.Story continuesSPGI leverages the constant demand for its subscription products. The company is also seeing an increasing demand for energy transition and advisory solutions. Multi-asset class demand from the insurance industry and bank-structured products are a plus for the company.Let’s look at some other factors that make SPGI a stock to be retained in portfolios.Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company’s prospects. For first-quarter 2023, SPGI’s earnings are expected to register a slight growth from the year-ago reported figure. For 2023 and 2024, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 11.3% and 15.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $2.9 for first-quarter 2023. The estimate has been revised slightly upward in the past 60 days.Earnings Surprise HistorySPGI has a decent earning surprise history having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the four trailing quarters and missed in the other two. The average surprise is 0.2%.SPGI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some RisksS&amp;P Global's current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of fourth-quarter 2022 was pegged at 0.94, lower than the current ratio of 2.31 reported at the end of fourth-quarter 2021. It indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.The company caters to a very competitive market and such tough competition restricts the company to use the pricing power to its advantage. The top line has been impacted by the unfavorable macroeconomic environment and suspension of commercial operations in Russia.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Zacks Business Service sector may consider the following stocks:ICF International (ICFI) is being aided by the strong government business, courtesy of improvement in the business development pipeline and win rate. In the fourth quarter of 2022, ICFI reported better-than-expected results.

For first-quarter 2023, ICFI’s earnings are expected to register 6.1% growth on a year-over-year basis. For 2023, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 6.4% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.39, which has been revised upward by 4.5% in the past 60 days.

The company’s earnings are expected to grow 3.2% on a year-over-year basis in 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.39, which has been revised downward by 2.1% in the past 60 days.

The Swiss National Bank, however, helped ease concerns, pledging to provide Credit Suisse with liquidity if needed.The turmoil in Credit Suisse added to growing concerns about a widespread banking crisis at a time when some U.S. banks are also in the spotlight.First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) fell more than 16% after the S&amp;P Global, a credit rating agency, downgraded the bank’s creditworthiness to BB+, or “junk” status, from A-, amid concerns that depositions may pull their money.Worries about a deepening banking crisis come even as the Fed stepped in to rescue the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, while also launching a new lending facility to prevent further runs in banks.Still, that hasn’t stemmed the crisis of confidence in the banking sector, pushing the odds of the no-rate hike higher to nearly 60% from 20% a day earlier, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.The calls for the Fed to pause were further strengthened following economic data showing cooling wholesale inflation and signs of weakness in the consumer as retail sales unexpectedly slowed.Retail sales are expected to slow further in coming months, Morgan Stanley says, as the emergency allotments benefits expired in March, the “labor market continues to cool, and households become more cautious spenders, drawing down less and less on their excess savings…”Story continuesEnergy stocks, down more than 3%, were also a big drag on the broader market as investors fear the impact of a potential banking crisis on global growth, and energy demand.APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), Baker Hughes Co (NASDAQ:BKR), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) were among the biggest decliners.Tech, meanwhile, was flat as lower Treasury yields pushed big tech stocks higher, and helped offset a dip in semiconductor stocks.Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), traded well above their session lows.The market selloff has pushed stocks into oversold territory, setting up the potential for a rebound, Janney Montgomery Scott said, adding that the overall bottoming cycle remains intact.“The overall basing/bottoming cycle remains intact in our view, but the ride may get bumpier before it gets better.

Demand will be shifted to other Tyson facilities.Tyson will shut down a plant in Glen Allen, Virginia, with around 700 employees, and a plant in Van Buren, Arkansas, with nearly 1,000 employees.The company said the closures were part of a broader plan in its chicken division to improve operations and use full available capacity at each plant.“The current scale and inability to economically improve operations has led to the difficult decision to close the facilities,” a company spokesman said.The Wall Street Journal first reported the upcoming closures.In its latest quarter, Tyson’s chicken operating income almost halved from $140 million to $69 million amid increased pressure as the company’s profit margins fell from historic highs during the pandemic.Wall Street Journal report notes that chicken prices have fallen sharply in recent months as processors increase supply.Boneless, skinless breast meat prices fell from $3.50 in May of last year to about $1 by January, according to research firm Urner Barry, squeezing profits for companies.Price Action: TSN shares are down 1.12% at $56.66 during the premarket session on the last check Wednesday.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Mastercard with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Mastercard How Fast Is Mastercard Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Mastercard has grown EPS by 9.3% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Mastercard is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.4 percentage points to 57%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Mastercard's future profits.Are Mastercard Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Mastercard, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$355m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Mastercard but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesIs Mastercard Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Mastercard is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Mastercard that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Now.The next FOMC meeting is just around the corner. With the jobs report and the much awaited CPI report, we now have enough data to chew on as the FOMC meeting draws closer. In February, non-farm payrolls increased by 311,000 and the unemployment rate went up to 3.6%. Inflation seems to have cooled down, with the consumer price index for February rising 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis and 6% year-over-year, in-line with expectations. Economists and analysts argued that the implosion of SVB was enough to point the Fed in the direction of raising interest rates by 25 basis points at the March meeting. However according to CME's FedWatch Tool, 73.1% of the market seems to have priced in a Fed funds rate in the range 475 and 500 basis points, or a quarter point hike. 23.9% of the market expects the Fed to not issue a rate hike at all, and nobody expects a 50 basis point rate hike. While the CPI data for February shows signs of inflation cooling off, it is still running at 3 times the target rate of the Fed.William Blair's Macro Analyst: ""Inflation As A Whole Is Still Too High For The Fed's Liking""On March 14 Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook for the markets and the Fed. Chazal noted that the CPI report for February was encouraging. Though inflation seems to have cooled off it is still higher than 2%, where the Fed wants it to be, said the analyst. Chazal further spoke about the how the market havoc caused by the implosion of SVB has started to settle down. The market was pricing in a 50 basis point rate hike before the collapse of SVB and after the remarks of Fed chair Powell at Capitol Hill. However, in light of the current circumstances, Chazal thinks the Fed will go with a quarter point hike and not with a half point hike at the March meeting.Story continuesRichard de Chazal also noted that even if the SVB crisis had not happened, he expected the Fed to go with a 25 basis point hike. However, with an in-line CPI report and the ramifications of SVB, the analyst is now more confident about the Fed going with a quarter point rate hike.Richard de Chazal said that ""economic growth is slowly being suffocated"" and that is reflected in a variety of economic indicators including the yield curve, building permits, the money supply, and industrial production. Here are some comments from Richard de Chazal:""I think we are going to be in a tighter financial market environment for some time to come. With inflation still at 6%, even if the Fed slows the pace of those rate increases, it's certainly telling us it wants to see policy remain tight for a while. We'll have to see if anything else appears on the horizon in the financial market environment in the banking system. It seems like that's off the table for the moment, but I think we are looking at a more difficult economic environment over the coming several quarters.""In the aftermath of SVB, Richard de Chazal thinks that the Fed has addressed the SVB situation with the required urgency and noted that ""the banking system as a whole is still very sound"".On March 14, the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.68%, the Nasdaq Composite bounced 2.14%, and the Dow rallied 1.06%. While the markets reacted positively to the CPI report, stocks may have further downside as inflation remains sticky and the Fed remains hawkish. In such an environment, it can be helpful to look where smart money is allocating capital and what stocks do experts like, as there may be potential buying opportunities in these falling stocks. On a side note, these stocks may not be the best investments for everyone, as hedge funds and analysts may have different priorities, risk tolerance, and time horizon than the average retail investor. So, with any investment, it is important to do your own homework and evaluate your risk tolerance and goals before allocating capital.Some of the best falling stocks to buy now according to analysts and hedge funds include Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

Corporation and utility operator Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D). Dominion Energy’s stock price weakness was due in part to regulatory concerns surrounding its triennial rate review process and its offshore wind program. Additionally, management highlighted cost pressures, which could hamper growth rates. We believe these headwinds are short-term in nature and continue to hold our position.”12. Zscaler, Inc.

In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”11.

The biggest sale was Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC), a regional bank formed by the merger of SunTrust and BB&amp;T that we purchased during the height of COVID-19. At the time, this evolving opportunity growth company was not being recognized for its strong footprint in the Southeast. But the bank’s underinvestment in technology and exposure to auto lending could become greater risks in a downturn, leading us to exit the stock.”9. Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM)6-month Decline as of March 14: 36.74%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Though Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) has lost 36.74% over the past 6 months, it is one of the best falling stocks to buy now.

These funds held collective stakes worth $1.41 billion in the company.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Among our bottom contributors were Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), SVB Financial Group and Catalent. The tougher macro environment caught up with Atlassian in the quarter as the company is seeing slower software user additions as customers of all sizes moderate hiring and spending. However, the company still expects to grow sales at a mid-20s rate in Q4 and grow its strategically important cloud revenues 40%–45%. These are slower rates than we expected, and could slow further, but Atlassian’s growth metrics remain solid in light of the environment. In the short term, slower revenue growth will likely pressure margins and profitability given the company’s rapid hiring expansion in recent periods. But we detect a meaningful shift in tone from management on expense growth and margins now that top-line growth is slowing. While we fully expect Atlassian to keep investing in its large growth opportunities, we think a prudent reprioritization of this spending will lead to margin tailwinds in the medium term. We are sensitive to the slowing near-term growth dynamics but believe remaining invested is appropriate given the longer term profit growth potential.”8. Antero Resources Corp (NYSE:AR)6-month Decline as of March 14: 41.80%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Antero Resources Corp (NYSE:AR) was held by 53 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022.

The continued buildout of U.S. liquefied natural gas stems from utility plants switching from coal to natural gas and European demand.”7. Match Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MTCH) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH), a long-term holding of ours offers an important illustrative example of these effects. Tinder grew reported revenues 6% year-over-year, accelerating a debate about whether this particular asset has reached a plateau in its growth curve; however, revenues grew 16% on an FX neutral basis. Has this asset stalled or is it a mid-teens grower? Other factors will determine the one true answer to this question, though FX and the stated headline make the answer seem obvious when it is not. When foreign exchange movements are modest, people tend to focus more on FX neutral assuming those changes will normalize over time, yet when movements are extreme the headline takes prominence.”6. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)6-month Decline as of March 14: 36.18%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56On March 10, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar updated his price target on EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) to $48 from $62 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.

As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”In addition to EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), other falling stocks that are still widely held by hedge funds include Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

The first-in-class antiviral, which was shown to be safe and well tolerated in a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical study, is now progressing into Phase 2 clinical studies for the prevention and treatment of dengue.The new data indicate JNJ-1802 is effective against all four of the dengue serotypes in mouse models and provides strong protection against two tested serotypes (DENV-1 and -2) in non-human primates. These findings build on research published in Nature in 2021 that first identified the novel mechanism of action from the same chemical series as JNJ-1802. The mechanism of action prevents the interaction between two viral proteins (NS3 and NS4B), thereby stopping the ability of the virus to replicate. A similar mechanism of action was confirmed for JNJ-1802 with these new data. This new research, together with Phase 1 first-in-human data showing the compound to be safe and well-tolerated, is supportive of further clinical development of JNJ-1802 for both prophylaxis and treatment of dengue.""The unprecedented rise in dengue outbreaks throughout the past years offers a glimpse of what lies ahead as climate change continues to put more people and communities at risk of dengue,"" said Ruxandra Draghia-Akli, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Global Public Health R&amp;D at Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We know an antiviral will be critical to addressing the unmet needs today and tomorrow, and we are committed to developing our breakthrough compound to expand the toolset available to prevent and treat dengue.""Story continuesJanssen thanks its strategic partners in the research and development of its dengue compound, including the KU Leuven Rega Institute, the KU Leuven Centre for Drug Design and Discovery (CD3), Department of Virology at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Department of Infectious Diseases at Heidelberg University, Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences at the University of Texas Medical Branch Health (UTMB), Unité des Virus Émergents at Aix-Marseille University and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.The Growing Global Dengue ThreatDengue is a significant and growing global health challenge. As many as 400 million people contract the dengue virus each year, and the resulting illness is one of the leading causes of hospitalization among children in countries in Latin America and Asia. Despite the global burden of dengue, and the fact that reinfection is possible due to the presence of four dengue serotypes, there are no therapeutics available to treat the disease and only a limited number of prevention options have been approved.""The promising results of JNJ-1802 to date offer the hope that science will be able to deliver against this threat as more and more communities are impacted worldwide,"" said Marnix Van Loock, Ph.D., Lead for Emerging Pathogens, Global Public Health R&amp;D at Janssen Pharmaceutica NV. ""Dengue requires global action and we are proud to collaborate alongside partners here in Europe and around the world in advancing the development of this compound to its next phase.""The dengue challenge is likely to grow in the coming years. In 2022, countries like Singapore, Nepal and Bangladesh experienced some of their worst outbreaks on record, while non-endemic countries like France and the United States reported some of their first, locally-acquired cases, part of a broader trend of increasing zoonotic outbreaks linked to climate change.Strengthening Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Enduring Commitment to Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)Johnson &amp; Johnson’s work against dengue is one part of a larger, more than 15-year legacy working to address the burden of NTDs, a group of about 20 communicable diseases that affect more than 1.7 billion people in 149 countries around the world. In 2022, the Company joined the global community to endorse the Kigali Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, pledging to continue to donate up to 200 million doses annually of mebendazole through 2025 to tackle intestinal worms and advance novel R&amp;D programs to discover new medications needed to beat leprosy and dengue.In addition to developing JNJ-1802, Johnson &amp; Johnson is working to holistically strengthen R&amp;D for dengue, including through novel R&amp;D approaches and leveraging emerging technology.To support the Company’s clinical development program, Johnson &amp; Johnson is using artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast dengue hotspots and build predictive models for dengue incidence to accelerate trial recruitment and site sourcing. Data from the project was recently presented at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.Additionally, the Company launched the Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore in June 2022, which is focused on accelerating early-stage, discovery research to address the growing challenge of flaviviruses, including dengue. The Satellite Center, the first to be established in Asia, was launched as part of the Company’s broader efforts to expand the global network for R&amp;D and bolster local R&amp;D, building on a longstanding collaboration with Duke-NUS.You can learn more about Johnson &amp; Johnson’s efforts to beat NTDs, including dengue, by visiting JNJ.com/NTDs.About the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; JohnsonAt Janssen, we're creating a future where disease is a thing of the past.

172,474c8f20-644a-3119-8f2b-b46bfca49d1b,JNJ,2023-03-16,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154503840.html,1678895103,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is headquartered in New Brunswick, and is in the Medical sector. The stock has seen a price change of -12.87% since the start of the year. The world's biggest maker of health care products is paying out a dividend of $1.13 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.94% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.69% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.77%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $4.52 is up 1.6% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.91%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson's current payout ratio is 44%. This means it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.JNJ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.50 per share, with earnings expected to increase 3.45% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

173,d2e3b1e7-b0ee-3abf-9c00-8115c8a85998,JNJ,2023-03-16,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-jnj-trending-stock-130001314.html,1678885201,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has lost 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.94 indicates a change of +4.1% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $23.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $97.73 billion and $100.68 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.9% and +3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.4%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $2.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +5.86%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

176,12d8d35e-9f28-35e7-95a7-210c192028e0,MDT,2023-03-16,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at an All-Time Low,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-buy-185545693.html,1678647345,STORY,"['TGT', 'INTC', 'MDT', 'PYPL', 'WBA', 'GPN', 'VZ', 'UL']","[Although the biggest and most-established enterprises generally outperform smaller firms during troubled times, this concept doesn’t always ring true, meaning that speculators can target beaten-down blue-chip stocks to buy. To be sure, a few advantages exist in targeting this sector over a lesser-capitalized fare. First, let’s discuss the obvious: blue-chip stocks to buy undergird popular if not relevant businesses. Therefore, it’s much easier for these stalwarts to convince retail investors to take a shot at them as opposed to no-name organizations.Second, the popularity of blue-chip stocks to buy commands far greater attention than random market ideas trading over the counter. Put another way, CNBC could do a piece on the troubled giant, thus potentially attracting an army of contrarians. Third, for blue chips, their current volatility may not be their first rodeo. Thus, they may have a framework from which to recover. Finally, before moving on, all of these securities trade within a range of 20% up from their five-year lows. With that, below are the blue-chip stocks to buy for contrarian investors.INTCIntel$27.22MDTMedtronic$76.72WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$33.26ULUnilever$48.74VZVerizon$36.68GPNGlobal Payments$100.00PYPLPayPal$73.43InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockOne of the semiconductor and technology firms in the world, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) organically commands significant respect. However, a series of sector challenges – most notably intense competition – and unforced errors took the sheen off Intel’s reputation. Unfortunately, the unusual troubles attracted the bears, who proceeded to beat up INTC. In the trailing five years, it’s down over 48%.Nevertheless, INTC could make up the ranks of severely deflated blue-chip stocks to buy. On paper, the company presents an undervalued profile. For example, the market prices INTC at a trailing multiple of 13.49. As a discount to earnings, Intel ranks better than 63% of the competition. Also, INTC trades at a trailing-year sales multiple of 1.73. In contrast, the sector median value is a lofty 2.44 times. As well, Intel features a price-to-book ratio of 1.08 times, below roughly 84% of the semiconductor industry. To be fair, Wall Street analysts peg INTC as a hold. Still, their average price target of $27.31 at least implies positive growth from the time of writing.Story continuesMedtronic (MDT)An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patientSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.comAn American medical device company, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) develops and manufactures healthcare technologies and therapies. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, greater focus centers on medical innovations. Theoretically, this dynamic should help MDT stock. Unfortunately, the market blasted it, causing it to shed over 25%. In the trailing five years, MDT slipped 4%. Still, for the contrarian investor, MDT may rank among the blue-chip stocks to buy. Perhaps most enticingly, the market prices MDT at a forward multiple of 14.34. As a discount to earnings, Medtronic ranks better than 87.88% of the medical devices industry. As well, Medtronic trades at 2.02 times its book value. In contrast, the sector median value is 2.75 times.Also, prospective contrarians should note that Medtronic carries a forward yield of 3.49%. As well, it commands 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MDT as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $92.23, implying over 18% upside potential.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)a hand grabbing a prescription from a shelf full of drugsSource: ShutterstockA holding firm that owns the retail pharmacy chain Walgreens in the U.S. and Boots in the U.K., Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) brings natural relevancies to the table. Unfortunately, Walgreens suffered substantial political controversy. Newsweek reports that California Governor Gavin Newsom won’t deal with the enterprise over its stance on reproductive rights. Frankly, I have zero interest in wading into a firebrand topic with which I will never have any direct experience. That said, it’s possible that with the passage of time, cooler heads may prevail, leading to a negotiation. As circumstances stand now, Walgreens offers an undervalued opportunity among speculative blue-chip stocks to buy.Specifically, the market prices WBA at a forward multiple of 7.43. As a discount to earnings, Walgreens ranks better than nearly 96% of the competition. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 5.77%. In addition, it features 47 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg WBA as a consensus hold. Still, their average price target hits $39.75, implying over 19% upside potential.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comA consumer goods giant, Unilever (NYSE:UL) manufactures various products, including food, condiments, bottled water, baby food, soft drink, ice cream, instant coffee, cleaning agents, and toothpaste, among many others. Because of its relevance, UL stock performed well during the trailing year, gaining 10% of equity value. However, in the past five years, it slipped over 7%.Now, that doesn’t sound like much. However, UL currently trades near its five-year low, which presents risks. However, those that want to speculate on underappreciated blue-chip stocks to buy may consider Unilever. For instance, Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) identify UL as modestly undervalued. Operationally, Unilever enjoys a very strong net margin of 12.74%. Also, the company benefits from a zero-debt profile. If that wasn’t enough, UL carries a forward yield of 3.75%. This ranks much higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Looking to the Street, Argus Research believes UL is a buy, forecasting a $60 price target. Should it get there, investors will enjoy over 23% upside.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockA multinational telecommunications giant, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) offers voice, data, and video services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms. Notably, Verizon represented the first company in the world to launch commercial 5G for mobility, fixed wireless and mobile edge computing. Nevertheless, the market has not treated VZ well. Indeed, in the past five years, VZ gave up nearly 25% of its equity value.In full transparency, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that VZ may be a possible value trap. For those that want to take an eventual trip with their blue-chip stocks to buy, the telecom stalwart features some exciting metrics. For example, the market prices VZ at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to earnings, Verizon ranks better than 85.15% of the competition. Despite the downside dangers, it will be difficult for investors to ignore passive income. Right now, Verizon carries a forward yield of 7.14%. Also, it commands 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg VZ as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $46.50, implying over 27% upside potential.Global Payments (GPN)A hand lingers over a bright blue tech wheel that says ""fintech.""Source: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.comA financial technology (fintech) company, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides payment technology and services to merchants, issuers, and consumers. Although relevant during decisively bullish cycles, Global Payments struggled for traction as inflation negatively impacted consumer sentiment. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, GPN gave up over 17% of equity value. In the past five years, it’s down nearly 11%.Nevertheless, it’s quite possible that Global Payments could be one of the deflated blue-chip stocks to buy. Yes, I must state that Gurufocus.com believes it could be a possible value trap. Objectively, though, the market prices GPN at a forward multiple of 10.21. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 75.16% of the field. Operationally, the fintech firm also features attractive attributes. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 9.7%, above 71.47% of the industry. As well, its operating margin pings at 18.63%, beating out nearly 84% of sector players. Turning to the Street, analysts peg GPN as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $139.74, implying nearly 33% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAnother big name in the burgeoning fintech ecosystem, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) specializes in digital payment solutions. As well, the company provides business management software for independent entrepreneurs. With the gig economy rapidly growing in popularity – thanks in no small part to the wider remote operations experiment – PYPL may be one of the best discounted blue-chip stocks to buy.Nevertheless, investors must exercise patience. In the trailing year, PayPal shares tumbled 23%. And in the past five years, they’re down almost 8%. Enticingly, though, Gurufocus.com identifies PYPL as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations.Objectively, PayPal still delivers the goods operationally. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.7%, outpacing 77.53% of the competition. Also, during the same period, its book growth rate pings at 7.4%, above 63% of its peers. Finally, covering analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $111.15, implying over 46% upside potential. Thus, if you can handle the heat, PayPal is one of the blue-chip stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

They also cast China in an unfamiliar leading role in Middle Eastern politics. And they raised questions about whether the U.S.-Saudi relationship — frosty for much of the first two years of President Joe Biden's term — has reached a détente.But as the Biden administration takes stock of the moment, officials are pushing back against the notion that the developments amount to a shift in the dynamics of the U.S.-China competition in the Middle East.The White House scoffs at the idea that the big aircraft deal signals a significant change in the status of the administration's relations with Riyadh after Biden's fierce criticism early in his presidency of the Saudis' human rights record and of the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel move to cut production last year.""We’re looking forward here in trying to make sure that this strategic partnership really does in every possible way support our national security interests there in the region and around the world,"" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. He spoke after Boeing announced this week the Saudis would purchase up to 121 aircraft.But China's involvement in facilitating a resumption of Iran-Saudi diplomatic ties and the major Boeing contract — one the White House said it advocated for — have added a new twist to Biden's roller-coaster relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Story continuesAs a candidate for the White House, Biden vowed that Saudi rulers would pay a ""price” under his watch for the 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom’s leadership. More recently, after the OPEC+ oil cartel announced in October it was cutting production, Biden promised “consequences” for a move that the administration said was helping Russia.Now, Washington and Riyadh seem intent on moving forward, and at a moment when China is at least dabbling in a more assertive Middle East diplomacy.Saudi officials kept the U.S. up to date on the status of talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia on restarting diplomatic relations since they began nearly two years ago, according to the White House. Significant progress was made during several rounds of earlier talks hosted by Iraq and Oman, well before the deal was announced in China last week during the country's ceremonial National People’s Congress.Unlike China, the U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and was not a party to the talks.The Iran-Saudi relationship has been historically fraught and shadowed by a sectarian divide and fierce competition in the region. Diplomatic relations were severed in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Protesters in Tehran stormed the Saudi Embassy and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed “divine revenge” for al-Nimr’s execution.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan earlier this week said China was “rowing in the same direction” with its work at quelling tensions between the Gulf Arab nations that have been fighting proxy wars in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq for years.“This is something that we think is positive insofar as it promotes what the United States has been promoting in the region, which is de-escalation, a reduction in tensions,” Sullivan said.But privately White House officials are skeptical about China's ability, and desire, to play a role in resolving some of the region's most difficult crises, including the long, disastrous proxy war in Yemen.Iran-allied Houthis seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile in Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in 2015.Years of inconclusive fighting created a humanitarian disaster and pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine. Overall, the war has killed more than 150,000 people, including over 14,500 civilians, according to The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project.A six-month cease-fire, the longest of the Yemen conflict, expired in October, but finding a permanent peace is among the administration's highest priorities in the Middle East. U.S. special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking is visiting Saudi Arabia and Oman this week to try to build on the U.N.-mediated truce that has brought a measure of calm to Yemen in recent months, according to the State Department.Beijing swooped in on the Iran-Saudi talks at a moment when the fruit was already “ripening on the vine,” according to one of six senior administration officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private White House deliberations. The Iran-Saudi announcement coincided with Chinese leader Xi Jinping being awarded a third five-year term as the nation’s president.The official added that if China can play a ""reinforcing role” in ending hostilities in Yemen the administration would view that as a good thing. But both the White House and Saudi officials remain deeply skeptical of Iran's intentions in the Yemen war or more broadly acting as a stabilizing force in the region.“While these discussions were going on, in the last 90 days, we have interdicted five major weapons shipments coming from Iran to Yemen,” Gen. Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, told lawmakers on Thursday. ""One of those shipments included components, inertial navigation systems for short-range ballistic missiles. So again, I think the implementation is a completely different matter.”To date, China, which has a seat on the U.N. Security Council, has shown little interest in the Yemen conflict, Syria or the Israeli-Palestinian situation, according to administration officials. Yet, Xi this week called for China to play a bigger role in managing global affairs after Beijing scored a diplomatic coup with the Iran-Saudi agreement.""It has injected a positive element into the peace, stability, solidarity and cooperation landscape of the region,” China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Geng Shuang told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. “We hope it can also create conducive conditions for improving the situation in Yemen.”The administration officials said Beijing has shown modest interest in reviving the seven-party Iran nuclear agreement — of which it is a signatory — that President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from in 2018. The Biden administration put efforts to revive the nuclear agreement on hold last fall after protests broke out in Iran following the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained for allegedly flouting Iran’s strict dress code for women.To be certain, China — a major customer of both Iranian and Saudi oil — has been steadily increasing its regional political influence. Xi traveled to Riyadh in December and received Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Beijing last month.But Miles Yu, director of the China Center at the Hudson Institute, said Xi's call to be a more active player on the international stage would require Beijing to dramatically change its approach.“China's diplomatic initiatives have been based on one thing: money,” said Yu, who served as a China policy adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the Trump administration. “They've made friends in Africa and Asia, but mostly it was monetary. These kind of transactional dealings do not forge permanent friendship.”Not every move China takes to engage more deeply with the Middle East necessarily harms the United States, noted Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and a frequent critic of Saudi Arabia.“But it’s probably true that China should pick up some of the cost of securing the oil that … frankly, is probably more important to them than to the United States in the long run,"" Murphy said. “I think China has benefited by being a free rider on U.S. security investments in the region for a long time.""The White House is not particularly concerned at the moment about the Saudis reorienting themselves toward China for several reasons, including that the Saudis' entire defense system is based on American weapons and components, administration officials said. The officials added that it would take the Saudis at least a decade to transition from U.S. weapons systems to Russian or Chinese oriented systems.Saudi Arabia’s reliance on U.S.-made weapons systems and the American military and commercial presence in the kingdom — some 70,000 Americans live there — have played a big part in the relationship weathering difficult moments over the years, said Les Janka, a former president of Raytheon Arabian Systems Co. who spent years living in the kingdom.It would take ""an unbelievable amount of activity to dismantle, given the reliance on American weapons, American technology, American training, everything that goes into it,” Janka said.___Associated Press writer Edith M.

The Senate Commerce Committee will vote on the measure next week.In January, the FAA halted all departing passenger airline flights for nearly two hours because of the pilot messaging database outage, the first nationwide ground stop of its kind since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The FAA, without a permanent leader for nearly a year, has come under fire after a series of recent near-miss incidents and still faces questions about its oversight of Boeing after two fatal 737 MAX crashes.Senator Ted Cruz, ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, and other Republicans say Washington, who retired from the U.S. Army in July 2000, must have a waiver from rules requiring civilian leadership to head the FAA and said Washington was unable to answer basic questions about the FAA.Senate Commerce chair Maria Cantwell says Washington is the right candidate to change FAA culture and ensure accountability: ""I definitely don't think he represents the status quo,"" she said this month.

Planemakers are also grappling with the after-effects of the pandemic, which forced waves of layoffs and retirements of skilled workers.However, the Dreamliner line has dealt with several unique challenges, including a year-long delivery pause due to production quality problems that were resolved last August.In February, Boeing's chief financial officer, Brian West, said the planemaker had to lower 787 production from three aircraft a month due to slower fuselage production at Spirit Aerosystems. The company also confirmed last month that it would need to replace a noncompliant component before delivering certain 787s.Story continuesWhile Airbus outsold Boeing in the Air India deal, landing orders for 40 A350 widebodys, the U.S. planemaker swept both the United Airlines and Saudi orders.The Saudi deal in particular was seen as a blow for Airbus which just months ago had been expected to land part of the order. Negotiations ebbed back and forth over the past year, echoing a volatile period in U.S.-Saudi relations.In October sources said Airbus may win an order for 40 of its A350 jets after Washington said it was reviewing options for Saudi relations in a dispute over oil output levels.Since then, diplomats and regional experts have said the United States and Saudi Arabia are trying to move beyond last year's low point in ties, as security concerns align over the threat from Iranian drones.Both Washington and Paris weighed in with lobbying, with Riyadh’s final decision taken at the highest level, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.One European source called the outcome of the plane order ""totally political,"" but a U.S. official denied there had been any diplomatic trade-offs.“Saudi Airlines is a government-owned airline, and so there are politics involved with this,” analyst Stallard said. ""I wouldn't rule out buying from Airbus if the Saudi government ... thinks its in their best interest to do some things with the Europeans in the future.”(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Washington and Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

Per the deal, the company will supply 39 787-9s to Riyadh Air with an option to supply 33 more later.Riyadh Air, which is owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, is the country’s new national airline in its capital city, Riyadh. The nation strives to transform into a global aviation hub and thus announced the intent to buy nearly 121 787 Dreamliners from Boeing. This marks Boeing’s fifth largest order based on the value in the commercial line of business.With this order, Boeing strengthens its eight decades of long-standing relationship with the nation’s aviation sector. It also opens avenues for more orders for the company in the long term, thus giving an opportunity to expand and capitalize on the growing aviation sector of the economy.Importance of 787-9 DreamlinerThe 787-9 provides the longest range of the 787 family of airplanes, flying approximately 300 passengers and 7,565 nautical miles, with additional cargo capacity. The airplanes boast features that offer a better experience and greater comfort for passengers. It is equipped with technology that senses and counters turbulence for a smoother ride.The 787 family of airplanes is beneficial to the environment and the airlines as it delivers unmatched fuel efficiency, thus reducing fuel use and emissions by 25% compared with the airplanes they replace. Considering the environmental regulations, the demand for such environmental-friendly aircraft is likely to increase manifold.Buoyed by such remarkable features, Boeing may continue to witness an inflow of orders for its 787 family of aircraft, like the latest one. This is likely to bolster its revenue generation prospects.Growth ProspectsConsidering the current rise in demand for air travel, commercial aircraft demand is projected to witness a solid rally in the days ahead. Other factors like increasing globalization, in which companies strive to expand their footprint globally, are fueling the need to travel more, thus driving the demand for commercial air travel.Story continuesPer the GlobeNewswire projection, the global commercial aircraft market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.3% over the 2021-2026 period.

Illumina Complete Long Reads allows a simpler workflow with reduced DNA input requirements compared with other long-read offerings.It is worth mentioning that in February 2023, at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) conference, early-access customers shared data supporting Illumina Complete Long Reads' high accuracy and flexible DNA input and the abilities that help to lessen cost and operational complexity.Illumina strategies to use this technology as a platform for long-read application development. Illumina will launch an enrichment assay — an even more affordable, higher throughput, targeted solution focused on regions known to benefit from additional insight with longer reads in the second half of 2023.Benefits of Illumina Complete Long Read technologyPer Illumina’s management, many long-read solutions have been restricted by high DNA input requirements, complex workflows with low throughput, and highly variable results on dedicated long-read instruments.

192,d3212b7c-66e2-3abc-b161-df4c139ea932,CI,2023-03-16,Is Trending Stock Cigna Group (CI) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-cigna-group-ci-130001876.html,1678885201,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this health insurer have returned -9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Cigna belongs, has lost 12.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $5.35 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.22 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cigna.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $45.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.6%. The $187.69 billion and $224.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.9% and +19.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $45.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.2%. EPS of $4.96 for the same period compares with $4.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.58 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +2.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 2.73%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.06%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Skyworks Solutions as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Skyworks Solutions is projected to report earnings of $2.01 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 23.57%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.15 billion, down 13.96% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.29 per share and revenue of $4.97 billion, which would represent changes of -17.35% and -9.43%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Skyworks Solutions. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Skyworks Solutions is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Skyworks Solutions currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.19. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.19, so we one might conclude that Skyworks Solutions is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that SWKS currently has a PEG ratio of 0.81. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. SWKS's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.68 as of yesterday's close.The Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 187, which puts it in the bottom 26% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Valued at $57.4 million, the contract is projected to be complete by March 2024.Details of the DealThe modification contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The deal involves providing continued sustainment, engineering, logistics, and test support for MQ-4C Triton air vehicles.The contract also entails offering continued field service representative’s technical support to ensure that the MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) aircraft are capable of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The deal will serve both the U.S. Navy and the government of Australia.The work will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States.Importance of MQ-4C TritonNorthrop Grumman’s MQ-4C Triton UAS provides real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions.Triton is equipped with a unique and robust mission sensor suite that provides 360-degree coverage on all sensors, providing unprecedented maritime domain awareness for the U.S. Navy. Built for the U.S. Navy, Triton supports a wide range of missions, including maritime ISR patrol, signals intelligence, search and rescue and communications relay.Such features of the MQ-4C Triton make it attractive for the military, thus resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. This is likely to boost the revenue-generation prospects of the company from the UAS business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, a military UAS that forms an integral part of any defense system due to its surveillance and reconnaissance abilities is likely to witness pent-up demand.Story continuesPer a report from Markets and Markets firm, the military unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.9% over the 2022-2027 period. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as it offers a wide range of aerial vehicle that already enjoys an established position in the military UAV market.The abounding growth prospects of the UAV market should also benefit other defense majors that have forayed into this market. These include Lockheed Martin LMT, Raytheon Technologies RTX and Kratos KTOS.Lockheed’s Skunk Works is involved in the designing of revolutionary ISR and UAS systems and associated enabling technologies.

But what many of those heroes really needed was functional, fitted scrubs.Meet healthcare-apparel company FIGS, Inc. (NYSE: FIGS), which offers stylish scrubs for men and women made of its proprietary fabric FIONx, which provides four-way stretch and has anti-odor, anti-wrinkle and moisture-wicking properties.The company was founded a decade ago and started with a simple concept: Tailor scrubs to fit better than the boxy, medical-supply version that previously were the only choice. Indeed, it was one set of custom-tailored scrubs that turned heads and inspired the launch of FIGS, which has become a standout in the fragmented healthcare clothing industry.FIGS transformed the scrub industry into a consumer business, allowing medical professionals to choose products that suit them best. It’s also a digital direct-to-consumer model, which helps FIGS command a healthy gross margin of roughly 70% and leans heavily on its digital capabilities.Story continuesFIGS continues to focus on innovation, introducing products such as the Salta Underscrub &amp; Leggings, the Montex Scrub Top and the 22-Pocket Pant, among others. These products have been designed to serve the healthcare community on-shift and off-shift from head-to-toe.Another big advantage: FIGS continues to get plenty of free marketing from loyal customers. Many of them post their favorite photos of FIGS products in action and the brand attracts followers on major social media platforms. On Instagram, for instance, @wearfigs has 831,000 followers.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.That translates to robust customer growth – at a reasonable cost. Active customers rose 22.5% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter. The company has said word-of-mouth is the number one driver of new customers.FIGS is also reaching institutions that purchase scrubs and apparel on behalf of their entire staff. Such institutions account for about 15% of all medical professionals and naturally can make very large, regular orders.FIGS reaches those institutions through its TEAMS platform, which provides an easy way to make standardized uniforms for staff members. The platform offers access to FIGS apparel, ease of adding logos, personalized embroidery and inclusive sizing.While FIGS is an asset-light retail model, it sees value in some physical contact with customers. The company’s first brick and mortar retail store is scheduled to open in Los Angeles’ Century City Mall in 2023 and will let professionals experience products in person, contributing to brand awareness and more online purchases.And there’s more to the story than traditional scrubs. Sales in the non-scrub wear assortment, which includes various other layers, rose 39% in the fourth quarter to reach 21% of net revenues. Orders that included non-scrub wear delivered a 14% higher units per transaction than scrub wear-orders.FIGS is constantly looking for more ways to expand its addressable market. The FIGSPRO line, for instance, is a polished and performance driven office-ready collection launched last year. It’s designed for administrators and others who want a more refined, tailored look in their work environments.Longer term, FIGS could expand into different industries where uniforms are the norm but haven’t evolved over time. That could mean anywhere people need comfortable, flexible uniforms – from chemistry labs to marine environments to factory floors.FIGS has also been expanding internationally, where it currently generates just 10% of sales. The company has distributed its products to 13 countries, including Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, New Zealand, UAE and Israel. In 2022, international net revenues grew by 50% as the company executed localized marketing strategies to optimize each market according to its customers’ needs and preferences. FIGS believes it has the opportunity to reach approximately 118 million international healthcare professionals.FIGS is also investing in infrastructure to enhance fulfillment, support scale, increase reliability, flexibility, speed to market and optimize the supply chain to support innovation and future growth. The company is also launching a retail strategy focused on creating community hubs to create a seamless, personalized shopping experience through its website and mobile app.On the ESG side, FIGS is committed to advocacy and giving back to the healthcare community. The company has committed $500,000 to-date to build a new operation theater in Matibabu’s hospital in Kenya and donated scrubs to the Boda Girls Initiatives, an organization whose mission is to provide women safe passage to and from hospital appointments in rural Kenya.FIGS also has an impressive management team, led by Co-Founder and CEO Trina Spear, who was an associate with the Blackstone Group in the firm’s hedge fund division and spent four years with Citigroup’s investment banking and private equity divisions. She also completed her MBA at Harvard Business School. And COO Steve Berube brings serious industry experience, having served previously as Senior Vice President of Distribution and Logistics at Levi Strauss &amp; Co.In a strong vote of confidence, Ms. Spear recently more-than doubled her FIGS ownership with the purchase of 790,000 class A shares shortly after the company announced its full-year results, bringing her total holdings to 1.4 million shares. She also owns about 5 million class B shares which don’t generally trade publicly.Turning to financials, the company issued guidance for mid-single-digit revenue growth and an Ebitda margin of 11% to 12% in 2023. But both of those metrics understate the company’s longer term strength and may themselves be conservative estimates.Indeed, the company grew much faster during the COVID era and its inventory has temporarily expanded as demand normalized. The good news is that most of that inventory consists of core products that sell year in and year out, so there’s not a terrible rush to slash prices on it.The revenue forecast also looks well within reach. After all, the company continues to add active customers at healthy clip and any promotions should give sales an extra boost.But even if 2023 isn’t as strong as usual, the company’s longer-term prospects remain robust. Both Ebitda margins and sales growth should return to levels at or near 20% as it moves through extra inventory, supply-chain issues alleviate and continues to capture more market share.Analysts expect Ebitda to grow 41% in 2024 to $88 million, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform. That’s a multiple of just 9.3 times compared with Lululemon at 16 times.Importantly, FIGS has shown financial discipline and has a debt-free balance sheet. Given its healthy cash flow generation, the business should be able to carry on for many years on a self-funded basis even if it makes investments in growth.With a major head start in a category ripe for disruption, FIGS has much more to achieve. Savvy investors should consider following Ms. Spear’s lead and trying some FIGS shares on for size while the opportunity lasts.Contact:IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.comInstagram: @ipoedgeTwitter: @ipoedge]"

Last December, the FDA revised the emergency use authorization (EUA) granted to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines wherein children under five years would receive a primary two-dose regimen consisting of two 3-µg doses of the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine followed by a third 3-µg dose of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Prior to this revision, the children in this age group were being administered all three doses of the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.The latest label expansion by the FDA will allow children under five years who had received all three doses of the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to update their protection by receiving the bivalent vaccine as a single booster dose.Shares of Pfizer have lost 22.1% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 7.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe bivalent vaccine contains an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.This Omicron BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine is already authorized for use in individuals aged five years and older.Last August, the FDA granted EUA to Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s MRNA Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines for a single booster dose. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna booster vaccines can be given at least two months following primary or booster vaccination.While a 50-µg dose of Moderna’s Omicron booster is authorized for adults aged 18 years and older, a 30-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s version is authorized for use in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older.Story continuesThe EUA was further expanded in October 2022 to include children as young as five years. Following the EUA expansion, a 10-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for individuals aged between five and 11 years. A 25-µg and 50-µg dose of Moderna’s bivalent vaccine was also authorized by the FDA for use in children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, respectively.Currently, Moderna’s bivalent vaccine is authorized by the FDA for use as a single booster dose in individuals aged six months and older.Pfizer and BioNTech have also submitted a regulatory filing to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking authorization for the use of their bivalent vaccine in individuals aged under five years. The filing seeks authorization for using the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine as both primary series (all three doses) and booster vaccination (fourth dose). Currently, the bivalent vaccine is authorized in Europe as a booster dose for individuals aged five years and older. Similar regulatory filings are planned for submission to other regulatory authorities across the globe.Pfizer Inc. Price Pfizer Inc. PricePfizer Inc. price | Pfizer Inc.

""The FOX FUTURE project represents a long-term commitment to our industry, to our community, and to the City of Los Angeles.""FOX FUTURE represents a historic investment in support of both the entertainment industry and Los Angeles' Century City business community that will:Build new multi-media sound stages as well as post-production facilities, basecamps, and media campus offices to respond to changing technologies and increased demand in film and television production.Create an opportunity for much sought after top-of-class general office space in Century City with a new LEED-Platinum office building along Avenue of the Stars.Honor the significant legacy of this historic property.Maintain thousands of existing jobs by helping to curb runaway production and create new jobs throughout Southern California.Generate approximately $9 million in direct annual revenue to the City of Los Angeles that will help fund public services such as libraries, parks, police and fire services.Provide over $20 million in anticipated Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Fees which focus on West Los Angeles specific improvements.Advance sustainability efforts on the FOX Studio Lot with two new LEED-Platinum office buildings and other sustainability measures.Invest in West Los Angeles transit solutions and further support the much-anticipated Metro D-Line when it opens to Century City in 2025.Story continuesNEW &amp; MODERN PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTUREThrough the productions that have been brought to life on the FOX Studio Lot, families witnessed a Miracle on 34th Street, the world fell in love with the Sound of Music, the fourth major American broadcast network was launched, live sports broadcasting was revolutionized, and FOX viewers gained an insatiably mischievous kid brother named Bart Simpson. However, motion picture and television production has fundamentally changed with innovative new technologies introduced every day as the entertainment industry continues to evolve. More so, Los Angeles continues to struggle to meet the demand for sound stages, which is increasingly driving production and entertainment jobs outside the region.With FOX FUTURE, FOX will add nine net new sound stages to the Lot, bringing the number of stages to 24. Additional stages—equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and designed for modern film, television and content creation—will help meet entertainment industry demand and keep jobs in Los Angeles.Additionally, the project will create a LEED-Platinum designed media campus office building to support FOX Studio Lot operations. Located on the Lot along Olympic Boulevard, the 24-floor building will focus on creating collaborative open spaces and shared and private offices, all designed specifically for film and television production.AVENUE OF THE STARS BUILDING Century City is one of the world's most prestigious business districts, and home to global corporations, entertainment giants, and emerging entrepreneurs within steps of premium retail, dining, hotels, and ever improving public transit. In Century City today, particularly along Avenue of the Stars, there are few opportunities for new construction and office occupancy rates remain the among highest in Los Angeles.With FOX FUTURE, FOX could seek a development partner to transform the northeast portion of the Lot along Avenue of the Stars into a world class, state-of-the-art building with 35 floors of office above seven floors of parking. Designed to meet LEED-Platinum standards, it would further activate the Avenue with its new public plaza and provide convenient access to the much-anticipated Metro D-line and allow for both direct connection to the Lot and entirely independent office space. Demonstrating a significant investment in the City's future, the proposed office building would be designed to attract a notable corporate presence and provide a new headquartering opportunity in Century City.ECONOMIC IMPACTFOX FUTURE is expected to be a major economic driver for the City of Los Angeles, responsible for an expected $1.5 billion in economic impact throughout Los Angeles County and will generate approximately $9 million annually in tax dollars that can be used to fund public services such as schools, libraries and emergency response services, underscoring FOX's commitment to the community.TRANSIT INVESTMENTFOX FUTURE is a transit-focused project focused on investing in transportation solutions and mitigating the impact of development. It will activate the new D-Line's ridership potential while also enhancing connectivity for pedestrians and multi-modal travelers and implementing various strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled. The program will be consistent with the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles Department of Transportation policies and procedures, including localized transportation-related goals detailed in The West Los Angeles Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Specific Plan.SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTAs part of Fox Corporation, the FOX Studio Lot has a strong commitment to sustainability. Today on the Lot, FOX continues to take steps to reduce carbon emissions, pursue clean energy and responsibly dispose of waste. With FOX FUTURE, FOX will further these efforts by using green and recycled building materials, expanding solar infrastructure, installing green walls, reducing water consumption, and designing both the media campus office and Avenue of the Stars general office buildings to achieve LEED-Platinum standards.PRESERVING THE LEGACYThe FOX Studio Lot has played an important role in the history of film and television and that impact will be honored as part of the project. Even today and independent of FOX FUTURE, FOX is securing the legacy of the Lot with the upgrade of New York Street, the seismic retrofit of identified buildings and the renovation and reinvention of the FOX Sports Studio A, incorporating cutting-edge graphics technology.With FOX FUTURE, FOX will continue to preserve the legacy of this important filming location with an updated Historic Preservation Plan that painstakingly relocates key buildings on the Lot and ensures the architectural character of this site is honored.Additional details about FOX FUTURE as well as images, maps, project updates and more are available at www.FOXFUTURE.com.ABOUT FOX CORPORATIONFox Corporation produces and distributes compelling news, sports, and entertainment content through its primary iconic domestic brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment and FOX Television Stations, and leading AVOD service Tubi.

Todd Brooks, FalconStor's Chief Executive Officer; and Vincent Sita, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's results and activities, and we'll then open the call to your questions. The company would like to advise all participants that today's discussion may contain what some consider forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in FalconStor's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the company's press release issued today. During today's call, there will be discussions that include non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to GAAP has been posted on FalconStor's website at www.falconstor.com under Investor Relations. After the close of business today, FalconStor released its Q4 2022 earnings. Copies of the earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on FalconStor's website at www.falconstor.com. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Todd Brooks.Robert Todd BrooksAll right. Well, thank you, Clark, I appreciate that. And I'd like to thank each of you for taking your time to participate in our call today. Q4 was obviously an important quarter for FalconStor as we increased our hybrid cloud annual recurring revenue, delivered positive net income, added new customers through our partnership with IBM, expanded our MSP business and improved legacy customer retention. FalconStor is a trusted data protection innovator, and we enable the world's most demanding managed service providers and enterprises to modernize their disaster recovery and data backup operations for the hybrid cloud world, protecting data across on-premise data centers, private cloud and public cloud environments. Migration to the cloud, data center rationalization and increased leverage of outsourced managed services are top priorities for enterprise CIOs. And our fundamental macro shifts to which FalconStor software and technology and 20 years -- 20-plus years of market experience are well aligned. Our solutions deliver increased data security and provide for quick data recovery, including recovery from ransomware attacks. And our solutions accomplished these while driving down long-term data storage footprints by up to 95%. Our hybrid cloud data protection solutions excel in 4 key areas: First, in scalability, as our solutions enable customers to protect their mission-critical enterprise workloads; second, in off-site protection as our customers have flexibility to leverage any data storage medium from tape to modern object storage, whether that storage exists on premises or in the cloud; third, in cost savings, as our industry-leading patented data de-duplication technology empowers our customers to decrease their data -- their backup data storage by up to 95%; and then fourth, in hardware vendor flexibility, as our solutions integrate with IBM's power system hardware and Intel-based hardware. So packaged together, these advantages give our solutions competitive differentiation, especially within the IBM-centric enterprise IT environments. We're excited by the growth markets that we serve and their ability to drive significant recurring revenue growth for FalconStor in the future. Data protection as a service, hybrid cloud and managed IT services are growing quickly and are clear reflection of macro shifts in our industry to which FalconStor technology and experience are well aligned. In fact, the data protection as a service market is predicted to grow by 31% annually to $104 billion in 2027. The worldwide hybrid cloud market is predicted to grow by 20% annually to $204 billion in 2027. And the managed IT services market is predicted to grow by 8% annually to $355 billion in 2026. Our go-to-market focus on hybrid cloud partners like IBM and managed service providers like Service Express will be key drivers for FalconStor to generate consistent and meaningful recurring revenue growth over the next several years. Now for 2023, we have initiated 4 -- or 3 key strategic initiatives -- one second here. Sorry about that. First, on expanding our differentiated hybrid cloud data protection leadership position for the tens of thousands of companies that operate IBM Power Systems environment. And then secondly, on extending our IBM-centric hybrid cloud data protection position into Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS public cloud environments. And then third, on accelerating our ARR run rate growth while continuing to deliver consistent profitability and limiting risk. So in line with these strategic initiatives, we are pleased with the hybrid cloud reseller agreement we launched in late Q2 2022 with IBM to provide several new joint solutions, which combine FalconStor's StorSafe VTL software with IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Power hardware, and IBM Power virtual server cloud. And we are even more pleased to report that our sales began to increase with IBM in Q4. Our joint solutions migrate and optimize data protection for IBM customers, and these joint solutions include: first, an optimized backup and restore solution where enterprises running their IBM applications on premises or in the IBM Power virtual server cloud can now utilize our joint solution to securely and efficiently back up to IBM Cloud Object Storage; second, our joint solutions include a cloud migration solution, where enterprise is needing to migrate their existing on-premises power applications to the IBM Power virtual server cloud can now utilize our joint solution to take a secure snapshot and restored in the cloud, maximizing application availability and security; and then finally, the joint solutions include an advanced hybrid cloud backup solution, where MSPs working to use the cloud for a superior air gap off-site location, can now utilize our joint solution on-premises and pair that with a cloud instance or multiple cloud instances for secure and encrypted off-site backups. So to partner with IBM is clearly a material step forward for us. It should be a significant contributor to our long-term strategic goal to significantly increase our hybrid cloud recurring revenue. Now let's move on to our results. And in line with -- actually, so we've seen a material revenue growth since launching sales with IBM and with IBM partners, especially in the second half of 2022. So to illustrate this growth since our relationship with IBM started right at the beginning of the second half, we believe it's helpful to compare the second half of 2022 with the first half. So while total GAAP revenue, as we reported this afternoon in our earnings release, for the full year of 2022 declined compared to 2021, our total GAAP revenue for the second half of the year increased 26% as compared to the first half of the year. Within that total GAAP revenue then, the ARR run rate of our hybrid cloud business increased by 48%. Then within the cloud -- hybrid cloud revenue piece, our MSP and the ARR run rate increased by 36% in the second half compared to the first half. So we are pleased with this early validation of our hybrid cloud relationship with IBM. But we believe that we can increase these growth rates even further. And then a couple of other points. As an aid to our hybrid cloud and MSP ARR run rate growth, we retained 100% of our hybrid cloud customers in the second half. And that storage capacity used by our installed base customers increased by 3.3% on average each month. In addition to the strong customer retention and to the installed base capacity growth, we saw wins across all 3 major global regions: The Americas; Asia Pacific; and EMEA. We also won our first customer with the Microsoft Azure, IBM Power virtual environment offered by Skytap. And then finally, we secured several key customer references, which we'll review in a minute. It's also important to note though, that we generated this revenue growth in the second half while controlling our operating expenses and delivering positive net income in the second half of the year. So as mentioned, we've secured several key customer references, and these include testimonials from Tupperware, Kyndryl, City Furniture and Service Express. I'm not going to take the time to read each of these references during the call, but they are available on falconstor.com, and we obviously leverage these within IBM and FalconStor marketing material. So at this point, I'll turn it over to Vincent to provide a more detailed overview of our Q4 and full year of 2022 financial results. Vincent?Story continuesVincent SitaThanks, Todd. So if we look at -- we start with the income statement, looking at Q4, so if we could flip to the next slide. So looking at Q4 results, so we closed Q4 with $2.5 million in revenues, $2.2 million in gross profit. Our operating expenses were also $2.2 million, so therefore, our net operating income was essentially breakeven or a net operating loss of $19,000, and our net income was positive $20,000. So this compares to year-over-year as follows. So revenues declined, as Todd mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, 30% from $3.7 million to $2.5 million, a decline of $1.2 million. Our operating expenses were 27% or $800,000 lower than Q4 of 2021, so $2.2 million versus $3 million prior year. Therefore, the revenue decline was partly offset by the revenue -- by the expense savings. So net operating income was $300,000 lower in 2022 versus 2021, so it was negative $19,000 versus $243,000 previous year, despite the top line revenue decrease of $1.2 million. After accounting for income tax provisions, our net income in Q4 was slightly higher -- was higher in Q4 this year than Q4 of last year. So it was $20,000 positive versus $333,000 negative. If we look at the second half of 2022 versus the first half of 2022, we see a marked improvement as clearly outlined with Todd's comments. So having launched the sales with IBM and IBM partners in the second half of 2022, we generated the following: So we closed second half of 2022 with $5.6 million in revenues compared to $4.4 million in the first half of 2022, an increase of 26%; gross profit was $4.9 million versus $3.6 million; operating expenses were $4.5 million versus $5.3 million in the first half, a decrease of 14%; operating income was $0.4 million in the second half compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million in the first half; and finally, from a net income perspective, we generated $0.2 million in the second half compared to a net loss of $2 million in the first half of 2022. If we move on to the next slide, and we look at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 million compared to $1.7 million on September 30, 2022, and compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2021. Therefore, an increase of $0.3 million from Q3 this year, but a decrease over last year of $1.2 million. Looking at net working capital. So net working capital cash excludes contract assets and deferred revenues, but includes the redemption value of our term notes, ended at $1.2 million, an increase of $0.3 million from Q3 2022 and a decline of $2.4 million from Q4 2021. So we closed the quarter with $2.3 million in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.8 million and deferred revenues of $5 million. Todd, I'll turn it back to you for some final comments.Robert Todd BrooksAll right. Thanks, Vincent. I appreciate that. So we are absolutely encouraged by the growth that we delivered in the second half of '22 and by the progress that we've made with our IBM relationship in other areas. But we obviously have a lot of work in front of us to increase those growth rates even more and to remain profitable, and to expand our growth into some other areas. But we are excited by the markets we're serving and the competitive differentiation that we deliver to our managed service provider partners and our enterprise partners and enterprise customers every single day. So with that, let me, Clark, ask you to see if we can open up the line for questions.Clark Liddell(Operator Instructions) I'm not seeing anything yet, Todd, and no hands raised. So we, obviously, really appreciate everybody attending.Robert Todd BrooksYes, absolutely, and we will see everybody next time. Thank you.]"

Our 3 Top Picks.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-quantum-computing-stock-buy-194554002.html,1678650354,STORY,['IBM'],"[Investors looking for the best quantum computing stock to buy now are set to be among the biggest beneficiaries of this new technology being adopted for everyday use. These computers are far more efficient than regular computers and can be scaled much more easily than transistor-based CPUs, which cannot get smaller than an atom. As a result, companies researching and developing these computers will address an estimated $125 billion market by 2030, representing a nearly 37% compound annual growth rate. Moreover, civilian usage and sales to the average American isn’t the only motivation for quantum computing companies. The performance and efficiency of quantum computers make them perfect for intelligence and military purposes as well. As such, the U.S. will have to boost quantum computing research to keep its lead in this sector. China currently plans to spend more than seven times the U.S. on quantum computing research.With that in mind, the following picks are tied for the best quantum computing stock to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMInternational Business Machines$125.45IONQIonQ$4.56HONHoneywell$193.33IBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIBM (NYSE:IBM) isn’t a quantum computing pure play and has been trading sideways for a long time. That said, the company arguably has the best quantum computing segment in the industry. The segment may not add much to its financials or stock performance right now, but once the tech goes mainstream, Big Blue won’t disappoint.The company has state-of-the-art hardware and software for quantum computing. That includes the debut of IBM Condor this year with 1,121 qubits. That’s 41.5x more than the IBM Falcon from 2019, and the company plans to have a processor with 4,158 qubits in two years. Other competitors certainly exist, and companies like D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) had a quantum computer with 5,000 qubits as far back as 2020. However, when it comes to computers for general use, IBM leads.Story continuesIBM has partnerships in place to take advantage of integrating quantum computing into the cloud. In fact, it introduced the world’s first circuit-based commercial quantum computer in January 2019. While it may take a decade or more before the company can provide powerful enough computers with a reasonable price tag, that’s fine with me since the company provides a hefty 5.2% dividend yield for those waiting.IonQ (IONQ)A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ StockSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for the best quantum computing stock to buy now, IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is the most reliable pure-play pick. The company is developing trapped-ion quantum computers for general use and has partnerships that’ll have a profound impact on its financials down the road. A number of these partners have very deep pockets, including Dell (NYSE:DELL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Hyundai Motor (OTCMKTS:HYMTF), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).IonQ also has a strong balance sheet with $57.2 million in cash and $348.4 million in short-term investments. This stockpile should allow the company to weather economic volatility for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management expects annual bookings of $25 million this year at the midpoint of their guidance, translating to 50% year-over-year growth in this metric.IonQ also kicked off a “$13.4 million contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab” and “a second exciting new project with the U.S. government in Q3,” CEO Peter Chapman said on the company’s most recent earnings call.Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified business that is well-suited to gain a foothold in quantum computing. It is an important player in the defense industry already and has formed Quantinuum, “the world’s largest integrated quantum computing company,” with Cambridge Quantum. Honeywell doesn’t have the most extensive quantum computing lineup. The company primarily uses its quantum computing tech to aid its other segments, such as defense, finance and pharmaceuticals. The tech, however, is impressive. Honeywell has a commercially available quantum computer, “Model H1,” with 20 qubits. This model broke records, achieving a quantum volume of 512.As Quantinuum’s COO and president of Honeywell Quantum Solutions Tony Uttley put it, “What makes our quantum computers so powerful is having the highest quality qubits, with the lowest error rates. This is a combination of using identical, fully connected qubits and precision control.”Admittedly, there hasn’t been much news in the past few months about Quantinuum’s advancements. However, Honeywell’s significant free cash flow of $4.5 billion last year and a growing top line means Quantinuum should see steady investments.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company’s refineries are located across the United States, Canada and the U.K. Valero, which has ownership interests in 15 petroleum refineries, has a combined throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day.Valero boasts that its premium refining operations are resilient even when the business operating environment is carbon-constrained. Its refining business has the capabilities to generate handsome cashflows, which would allow it to return capital to shareholders and back growth projects.Valero’s renewable diesel segment involves the Diamond Green Diesel (“DGD”) joint venture, which is a leading renewable fuel producer in North America. The joint venture is between Darling Ingredients Inc. and Valero. Low-carbon fuel policies across the globe are primarily aiding the demand for renewable diesel, driving Valero’s Renewable Diesel business.With the commissioning of the DGD Port Arthur facility in the fourth quarter of 2022, DGD’s combined renewable diesel production capacity increased by 470 million gallons per year to approximately 1.2 billion gallons per year. In 2023, Valero’s renewable diesel margins are expected to remain consistent with the current levels.In 2022, Valero’s total throughput volumes increased to 2,953 thousand barrels per day from 2,787 thousand barrels per day. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located in the Gulf coast area from where there is easy access to the export facilities. This Gulf coast presence helped Valero expand its export volumes over the last few years and gain from high distillate margins.Valero’s commitment to the energy transition is commendable. The company is on track to reduce and displace Refinery GHG emissions by 63% through investments in board-approved projects by 2025. Hence, Valero is actively investing in low-carbon businesses such as biofuels, renewable diesel and wind power generation.Story continuesOther Key PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Antero Midstream Corporation AM reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. The strong quarterly results were primarily driven by higher freshwater delivery volumes and increased average freshwater distribution fees.For 2023, Antero Midstream expects a net income of $340-$380 million, indicating an increase from $326.2 million reported in 2022.Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s MPC adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54. The bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and another $700 million worth of shares from the start of this year to Jan 27. Marathon Petroleum, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $7.6 billion.Murphy USA Inc.’s MUSA fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $5.21 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.16. The underperformance can be attributed to lower-than-expected petroleum product sales.Murphy USA projects a 2023 fuel volume of 240-245 thousand gallons on an APSM basis. Further, Murphy USA’s 2023 guidance includes up to 45 new stores, up to 30 raze-and-rebuilds, and $795-$815 million in merchandise margin contribution.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.MPC is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.27. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's industry has an average PEG of 0.56 right now. Within the past year, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.32.We should also highlight that MPC has a P/B ratio of 1.70. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.82. Over the past year, MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.21, with a median of 1.59.Finally, our model also underscores that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.26. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. MPC's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.15. Within the past 12 months, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 3.70.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Valero Energy (VLO). VLO is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Valero Energy is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 5.62 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.94. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 5.64 and average PEG ratio of 0.56.Over the past year, VLO's P/E has been as high as 12.62, as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.39; its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.10, as low as 0.73, with a median of 0.32 during the same time period.Additionally, Valero Energy has a P/B ratio of 1.87 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.82. For VLO, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.70, with a median of 2.01 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that MPC and VLO is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But what exactly happened, and what stocks can investors buy to avoid the fallout?One way to avoid more carnage is to focus on quality defensive stocks.Silicon Valley BankAs the name suggests, Silicon Valley Bank was an institution that catered primarily to start-ups and venture capitalists, although not exclusively. With the explosion of tech and venture funding that followed the Covid-19 pandemic so too did the growth of Silicon Valley Bank. Between 2019 and 2022 deposits at the bank grew from $60 billion to $190 billion.In response to this massive influx of new deposits, SVIB began to load up on ""safe"" assets. It bought $80 billion of Mortgage-backed securities and long-term Treasury bonds. While these are typically nearly risk-less assets, the bank unfortunately bought the top of the bond market. As interest rates climbed throughout all of 2022, bond prices fell in response, creating paper losses on the bank's portfolio. Additionally, SVIB did very little to try and hedge its interest rate risk.Compounding the issues, deposits started falling rapidly. With the cycle coming to an end, many of the venture backed businesses banking with SVB were losing money or outright failing, drawing down deposits from the bank.To protect against these drops in deposits, the bank began selling some of its bonds at a loss. To manage the losses, SVB attempted a stock offering to raise $2.25 billion. This is where it all went wrong. This unconventional means of filling a liquidity gap spoked investors and eventually depositors.Story continuesIn a single day, on March 9, $42 billion of deposits withdrew and induced a run on the bank. This came primarily in the form of venture investments, as many well-known investors pushed companies to withdraw as soon as possible. Panic ensued and before the end of the day, Friday, the bank had closed preventing further withdrawals.Thankfully, the Fed and Treasury had the whole weekend to figure out a solution. First there were whispers of an auction occurring for the banks' assets, but on Sunday evening the emergency action from the Fed was announced. They would open the Bank Term Funding Program to save the failing institution.The BTFP is an emergency solution allowing banks to borrow funds against their current bond positions. Most importantly, it allows them to borrow against the par value of the bonds, allowing the institutions to avoid realizing any more losses on their bond portfolios.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank marks the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.What Now?This is a tremendous event the full effect of which is still unknown. The situation is still extremely fluid, and although it seems like the largest banks such as J.P. Morgan JPM, and Bank of America BAC are likely safe from contagion they are still selling off. Furthermore, the Regional Bank ETF  was down -11% just yesterday.As tempting as it is for some investors to start scooping up shares of beaten down banks, I am not so confident. While the big banks, and even regional bank stocks may well recover from here it feels too risky to jump in now. I would much prefer to focus on buying defensive stocks in case this issue has legs.Safety StocksIn looking for stocks I think may perform well in a more challenging economic environment I focus on stocks with a high Zacks Rank, an established business, a low P/E, and a decent dividend yield.Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and a reasonable valuation.Trading at 7x one-year forward earnings, Marathon Petroleum is well below its five-year median of 11x and just slightly above the industry average of 6x. It also offers a dividend yield of 2.3%, which has increased by an average of 7% annually over the last five years.Archer Daniels Midland, one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients is another stock that should provide a safe and steady return. ADM has a long history of continual dividend increases, and currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings expectations have been revised higher across all timeframes by as much as 25% over the last 90 days.Additionally, ADM is trading at a very reasonable 11x one-year forward earnings, below its five-year median of 14x, and under the industry average 14x.ASE Technology is a provider of semiconductor manufacturing services for assembly and testing. ASX may not be the most exciting growth stock out there, but it has steady returns, consistent revenue growth, and a dividend yield of 4.9%.ASX is trading at 9x one-year forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 13x and well below the industry average 19x.ASE Technology also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating strongly upward trending earnings revisions.ConclusionThe failure of Silicon Valley Bank is a significant event with unknown and potentially very far-reaching effects. The rising rate environment has begun to show that points of weakness developed during the boom, and this may not be the last case. To remain risk-averse, identifying defensive stocks may be one safe way to trade through this challenging period.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at McCormick (NYSE:MKC) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on McCormick is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.096 = US$927m ÷ (US$13b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2022).Thus, McCormick has an ROCE of 9.6%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%. View our latest analysis for McCormick roceIn the above chart we have measured McCormick's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThere hasn't been much to report for McCormick's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if McCormick doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why McCormick is paying out 57% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From McCormick's ROCEIn a nutshell, McCormick has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 48% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.One final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with McCormick (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The views were revealed at the 2023 JP Morgan Industrials Conference.High fuel costs are likely to hurt results of these airline companies in first-quarter 2023. Weak demand due to seasonality and reduced capacity may also get reflected in the results.Read the last Airline Roundup here.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 For the first quarter of 2023, United Airlines now anticipates a loss per share of 60 cents-$1.00 against the prior expected band of earnings per share of 50 cents-$1.00 (provided with the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 17). UAL now anticipates first-quarter 2023 total revenue per available seat mile to increase 22-23% year over year (prior view: up almost 25%). The downbeat view is due to weaker demand growth witnessed in January and February 2023 compared to other months.UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), now forecasts first-quarter 2023 average aircraft fuel price per gallon between $3.31 and $3.41 (prior view: $3.19).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2. Spirit Airlines now expects adjusted operating expenses of $1.45-$1.47 billion for the first quarter of 2023 (earlier view: $1.39-$1.40 billion). The adjusted operating margin is expected between -7 and -9%. Fuel gallons consumed are expected to be 143 million in the first quarter. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated in the $3.45-$3.50 band (earlier view was $3.20). The effective tax rate is still expected to be 24%.

JetBlue’s management expects first-quarter 2023 capacity to increase in the 8-9% range. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 2-4%. Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 32-35% range (previous outlook was in the 28-32% band). Average fuel cost per gallon in the March quarter is now estimated to be between $3.50 and $3.60 (earlier guidance: $3.2-$3.35). CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is now expected to increase in the 1-2% range in the March quarter (earlier view hinted at a 2-4% year-over-year rise).Management still expects first-quarter 2023 loss in the range of 35-45 cents per share. For full-year 2023, capacity is expected to increase in the band of 5.5-8.5% from the 2022 actuals. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 1.5-4.5% from the 2022 actuals. Total revenues for 2023 are still forecast to increase year over year in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Management still expects 2023 earnings per share to be between 70 cents and $1.00.4. Due to high fuel costs, Alaska Air’s management trimmed its forecast for first-quarter 2023 adjusted pre-tax margin. The metric is now expected in the -3 to -6% band (earlier range: -1 to -4%).

Total revenues are still expected to increase in the 29-32% range year over year. Capacity is still expected to increase in the 11-14% band.5. Southwest Airlines’ management expects to incur a loss in the first quarter mainly due to high costs. Moreover, LUV continues to expect a negative revenue impact in the $300-$350 million band in first-quarter 2023, primarily limited to January and February, due to operational disruptions in December 2022. For first-quarter 2023, operating revenues are now expected to rise in the 21-23% range as opposed to 20-24% year-over-year growth estimated earlier.Available seat miles are still estimated to improve 10% from the year-ago reported figure. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now expected in the $3.1-$3.2 range (earlier expectation: $3.25-$3.35). LUV now expects cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 5.5-6.5% in the first quarter from the comparable period in 2022 (earlier expectation was in the 2-4% range). Approximately 50% of the increase is due to the rise in expenses pertaining to the December 2022 operational disruptions. Interest expenses are still expected to be $65 million in the first quarter.For 2023, LUV expects available seat miles to improve 15-16% from the 2022 level.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about United Airlines (UAL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.United currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.7% and 5.9% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for UALBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for UALCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for United here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying United, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is UAL Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for United, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 25.3% over the past month to $8.30.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for United. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for United may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

236,f63f497b-1fd6-3783-9b62-17c625475cb3,UAL,2023-03-16,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights United Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-united-125412372.html,1678884852,STORY,"['AAL', 'UAL', 'ALK', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 15, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Alaska Air Group ALK.Industry: AirlinesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2065295/3-airline-stocks-to-buy-now-amid-buoyant-air-travel-demandUpbeat air-travel demand, both domestic and international, is aiding stocks in the Zacks Airline industry.  Driven by strong air-traffic, passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines' top lines, are seeing an uptick. Airline players like United Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group are likely to benefit from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Moreover, the labor crunch that is currently being faced by the airline industry is another woe.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry  houses players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers.Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy.For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air-travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is another positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryBuoyant Air Traffic: The stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge positive for the industry, which was one of the worst-hit industries in the peak COVID-19 period. People are again resorting to air travel with the resumption of normal activities. The removal of COVID-related restrictions is aiding air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well.Story continuesRecently, the United States ended COVID testing requirements for passengers from China. The restrictions had been in effect since Jan 5, following the renewed outbreak in China. This rosy scenario with respect to air traffic is likely to stay as is evident from the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) expectation of airlines returning to profitability in 2023.Focus on Cargo Revenues Bodes Well: The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues bodes well for top-line growth, especially in the current scenario where passenger revenues are rebounding strongly from the pandemic lows. Highlighting the focus on cargo revenues, United Airlines' revenues from cargo improved 49.4% in fourth-quarter 2022 from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals to $472 million. Per IATA's forecast, cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which though lower than the 2022 levels are still $48.6 billion higher than the 2019 actuals.High Costs: Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to high fuel and labor costs. The spike in fuel costs (oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period) is not a welcome development as expenses on fuel represent a major input cost for airlines. Moreover, with U.S. airlines grappling with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked recently in the space. This will result in an increase in labor costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 29-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #42, which places it in the top 17% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up 13.5% since September 2022.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 3.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 10.9% and the broader sector's decrease of 10.3%.The Valuation PictureThe price/sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.40X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.35X. It is also below the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.57X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.02X, as low as 0.33X and at the median of 0.67X.3 Transportation - Airline Stocks to BuyAll three stocks discussed below presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).United Airlines has a market capitalization of $15.97 billion and is presently based in Chicago.

For more retailers, head on over to 5 Biggest Retailers in the World. The retail industry is one of the largest sectors in the world, and one that has been disrupted by the internet and technology revolution. While traditionally retailers were limited to the brick and mortar operating model, the growth of the internet and the increasing use of smartphones and computers has forced them to place their operations online and created new areas such as last mile delivery.Subsequently, some of the biggest retailing companies in the world are online retailers, with this fact holding true for none other than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose massive success all over the world has made its founder Mr. Jeff Bezos one of the world's richest men. Additionally, out of the myriad of industries out there, the retail sector is one of the most valuable since its value is often estimated not in billions but in trillions of dollars. For instance, a research report from The Business Research Company outlines that the global retail market was worth $23.65 trillion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3% to sit at $26.3 trillion by the end 2022. From then until 2026, the research firm believes that the industry will continue to grow at a 10.1% CAGR and be worth $38.71 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Adding to this, business consulting firm McKinsey believes that retailers will have to transform their business operations if they want to stay ahead in today's evolving environment.

The enhancements will further assist companies in locating properties that meet a wide range of development criteria, including sustainability factors.The CSX Select Site program, launched in 2012 in partnership with Austin Consulting, a global leader in site development and identification, was the first railroad-sponsored certification program to offer rigorous site due diligence and capture the essential factors needed to accommodate rail access. Since the program’s inception, Select Sites have attracted dozens of manufacturers, with capital investments projected to reach $14 billion and create nearly 11,000 jobs.“The CSX Select Site program has been a tremendous success and is increasingly in demand by companies seeking to access the advantages of rail for improving supply chain efficiency while reducing their carbon footprint and meeting sustainability goals,” said Kevin Boone, CSX executive vice president of Sales and Marketing.To further assist companies and communities amid increasing competition for rail-served sites, the Select Site program is introducing four levels of qualification — Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. The four levels will help companies identify sites that best align with their needs. All sites will be included in a searchable inventory, called Zoom Prospector, currently under development. Users will be able to access the inventory at csx.com/selectsite.Thirteen Select Sites previously identified by Austin Consulting that remain on the market are the first sites designated as Platinum, given their size and the rigorous vetting already accomplished. In addition to meeting minimum site thresholds, Select Site Platinum candidates and designees must engage in a rigorous evaluation, while also completing standard due diligence studies. Platinum sites are 100-plus acres along CSX’s rail network that are ideal for large rail-served industrial facilities.Story continues“The greatest impact of the Select Site program has been creating a mechanism to assist communities in identifying their best industrial sites and to preserve them for capital-intensive, rail-served manufacturers,” said Jonathan Gemmen, senior director at Austin Consulting.Under the enhanced program, the Gold, Silver and Bronze sites will be identified using two new tools — Lasso and Site Shepherd — provided through a partnership with Global Location Strategies (GLS). CSX works with landowners and county economic development organizations to capture the relevant site data in Lasso, which is imported into GLS’ customized location analytic platform, Site Shepherd. Lasso is a proprietary data collection platform built to retrieve site-specific information from program registrants, including acreage, site characteristics, utility infrastructure and more. Site Shepherd houses an analytics model custom designed to evaluate CSX-served sites for key rail-served industry siting requirements. The platform provides data-driven analytics that empower CSX and its economic development partners to optimize the marketability of these rail-served sites and identify areas of improvement. Additionally, for the first time, CSX, supported by GLS, added considerations for environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, such as those concerning renewable energy, community impacts, and brownfield site reuse.Based on the properties’ Site Shepherd score, CSX designates top-performing sites as Gold, Silver or Bronze. All sites will receive valuable feedback regarding potential areas of improvement and are encouraged to engage with CSX on how to continually improve their score.“Factors ranging from sustainability to shortening supply chains by bringing manufacturing capability back to the U.S. are driving companies’ growing interest in the economic and sustainability advantages of rail,” said Christina Bottomley, CSX vice president of Real Estate and Industrial Development. “The Select Site program is another way CSX is partnering with companies to meet their business objectives.”Didi Caldwell, GLS President, added that the demand for investment-readiness programs is being driven by communities recognizing the need to have an “inventory of ready sites, primed and on hand for prospects” to compete with other communities for projects that foster economic development through building the tax base and creating jobs.“At Global Location Strategies, we are witnessing an unprecedented client demand for speed-to-market,” she said. “Employing site selection technology streamlines data collection and empowers CSX to self-perform the evaluation; running sites through a custom analytics model and providing a clear roadmap for future investment.”About CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company. It provides rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services and solutions to customers across a broad array of markets, including energy, industrial, construction, agricultural, and consumer products.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Royal Caribbean basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Royal Caribbean imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Royal CaribbeanThis cruise operator is expected to earn $3.30 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 144%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Royal Caribbean. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.7%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Royal Caribbean to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ADI) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/88-institutional-ownership-analog-devices-110023196.html,1678964423,STORY,['ADI'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Analog Devices implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently A look at the shareholders of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Analog Devices. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Analog Devices. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Analog Devices, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Analog Devices. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Analog Devices, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$307m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Analog Devices. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

248,326a2a05-7cda-3ec8-b2fd-a4ced737e8cc,ADI,2023-03-16,Amazon (AMZN) to Launch Kuiper Internet Satellites in 2024,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-launch-kuiper-internet-190407704.html,1678907047,STORY,"['AMZN', 'ADI', 'ANET']","[Amazon AMZN reportedly intends to launch its first internet satellites in the first half of 2024, thus putting an end to the quest for these satellites.Further, the company plans to roll out more than 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit in the next few years.Project Kuiper, which focuses on the creation of a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites in order to provide high-speed broadband service, is set to conduct the mass production of these satellites in the latter part of 2023.The beta-testing of these satellites will be done in 2024.To execute its latest plan, the company unveiled three different terminals or antennas to connect customers with its Kuiper satellites in orbit.Notably, these terminals will help reduce the costs incurred by the company in providing high-speed internet to its customers.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote More on KuiperAmazon has been eyeing the satellite and space areas for quite some time now in a bid to explore opportunities.Under Project Kuiper, the company plans to launch a network of 3,236 satellites into space to create an interconnected network.The 3,236 satellites will be divided into three layers with 784 satellites at an altitude of 590 kilometers, 1,296 satellites at an altitude of 610 kilometers and the remaining 1,156 satellites at an altitude of 630 kilometers.Amazon’s latest plan to launch internet satellites in 2024 is in sync with its target to half its entire Kuiper network of 3,236 satellites by 2026.Last year, the company partnered with Arianespace, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance to execute Project Kuiper. Per the terms, this partnership will provide heavy-lift launch services to Project Kuiper.We note that the Internet is ubiquitous and its increasing user penetration across the world has created immense growth opportunities for several companies.Amid this backdrop, we believe that Amazon’s Project Kuiper will likely gain strong momentum. The company’s growing efforts and investments in Kuiper are expected to yield high returns over the long haul.This in turn will aid Amazon in winning investors’ confidence in the days ahead. Notably, AMZN has lost 33.1% over the past year.Further, we believe the latest plans are likely to strengthen Amazon’s competitive position against SpaceX, which has the same ambitions as AMZN.SpaceX runs the Starlink program, with the help of which it intends to deploy tens of thousands of small satellites to provide broadband internet. Notably, Starlink network already has 4,000 satellites in space.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Salesforce CRM and Analog Devices ADI.

249,d039d29a-235d-3370-b018-4b70c7eb8d82,ADI,2023-03-16,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Analog Devices, Microchip Technology and Silicon Laboratories",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-analog-124912190.html,1678884552,STORY,"['ADI', 'MCHP', 'SLAB', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 15, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Analog Devices ADI, Microchip Technology MCHP and Silicon Laboratories SLAB.Industry: SemiconductorsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2065607/3-solid-buys-from-the-semiconductor-industryThe strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, Microchip Technology and Silicon Laboratories.About the IndustryThis industry includes mostly semiconductor chip manufacturers like Intel Corporation (INTC).Major Themes for the IndustryThis is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.The industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Data center demand has also dropped off sharper than expected as leading tech players absorbed the reduction in advertising demand. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains. The situation is expected to gradually improve as we get into the second half partly because some of the demand is expected to come back, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didn't have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. That's because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As semiconductors become important in defense, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Relatively Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #57, which places it in the top 23% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates relatively strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, it appears that analyst opinion about the 2023 outlook has improved while that for 2024 has weakened slightly: 2023 estimates have risen 5.9% over the past year, while 2024 estimates have dropped 3.7%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance Is AttractiveThe Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the S&amp;P 500 through most of the past year and starting from November it has pulled way ahead as the S&amp;P essentially flatlined. The broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector has trailed the S&amp;P 500 since April.Overall, the industry gained 13.1% over the past year while the broader sector lost 14.1% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.0%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 17.12X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500's 17.33X and the broader computer and technology sector's 21.22X. At the current level, it is however trading at a premium to its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between a 13.80X and 18.74X multiple over the past year.3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc.: Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Analog Devices' strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. Demand in these markets, particularly for automation and electrification are currently driving its business. These along with pervasive sensing, AI-driven edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity that are enabling new capabilities, applications and markets at the Intelligent Edge are secular drivers.As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing its output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has allowed it to lower lead times. However, it still has a significant backlog, which would translate into a year's revenue at the current level.Shipments are expected to increase through the year, bringing the backlog back to normal levels. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 13%, making it the fifth consecutive double-digit increase, and the 19th straight year of dividend increase.The company beat January quarter estimates by 6.2% and in the last 30 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company dropped a couple of cents The 2024 estimate increased by 90 cents (9.0%).The shares are up 25.3% over the past year.Microchip Technology Inc.: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip's demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where supply constraints are only now beginning to ease up.Management is currently focused on bringing down its backlog while maintaining the quality of new orders. As supply continues to improve and lead times come down, profitability will also improve. However, China's imposing and then suddenly raising its lockdown has resulted in inventory gluts that are an overhang on Microchip's business.Investors would be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 41.5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 7 cents (1.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate increased 35 cents (6.0%) during the same period.#2 ranked Microchip's shares are up 19.3% over the past year.Silicon Laboratories Inc.: Silicon Laboratories is a fabless semiconductor company offering wireless microcontrollers and sensor products primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan. Its products are used in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including connected home and security, industrial automation and control, smart metering, smart lighting, commercial building automation, consumer electronics, asset tracking and medical instrumentation.Silicon Laboratories is seeing solid momentum in its business, which has allowed it to double its organic revenue in two years  and increase its design wins by 120%. Management continues to see significant opportunity and expects the design win momentum to continue, further building its leadership position in IoT, despite the macroeconomic uncertainties.Silicon Laboratories topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 35.1% in the last quarter. Its 2023 EPS estimate has jumped a dollar (25.3%) in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 49 cents (9.0%).Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 stock are up 26.2% over the past year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

250,869410a2-4023-34d3-94c7-1ec445e0cda7,ADI,2023-03-16,Volvo and MicroStrategy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volvo-microstrategy-highlighted-zacks-bull-114811496.html,1678880891,STORY,"['MSTR', 'VOLV-A.ST', 'VLVLY', '^GSPC', 'ADI']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 15, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Volvo VLVLY as the Bull of the Day and MicroStrategy MSTR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Meta Platforms META, Salesforce CRM and Analog Devices ADI.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Among automakers, Volvo stock is standing out at the moment with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an overall ""A"" VGM Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.As the parent company of Volvo Group, Sweden-based AB Volvo recently hit 52-week highs earlier in the month and looks poised to continue growing its products and services.The Volvo Group manufactures cars, trucks, buses, construction equipment, and diesel engines along with marine and industrial engines. In addition to this, its offering includes insurance, rental services, spare parts, and preventive maintenance among other services.EV GrowthVolvo had a record year for revenue in 2022 driven by its progression into the EV space. In fact, Volvo is making the push to be fully electric by 2030 with EVs accounting for 11% of its total sales last year compared to 4% in 2021.Even better, this strong performance is spilling over into 2023 with Volvo most recently reporting sales of 51,286 cars in February, up 22% year over year. February's growth was attributed to its Recharge hybrid vehicles which made up 40% of global car sales while its fully electric car sales increased an impressive 187% YoY and accounted for 19% of total sales.Volvo's earnings are expected to be up 6% this year and rise another 1% in FY24 at $1.72 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last 60 days.After its record year, Volvo's sales are forecasted to dip -1% in FY23 and be virtually flat in FY24 at $46.24 billion. However, Fiscal 2024 would still be above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $45.70 billion.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Valuation Volvo stock is up +9% year to date to outperform the S&amp;P 500's virtually flat performance and the Auto -Truck-Origional Equipment Markets +1%. Over the last three years, Volvo's +80% has also topped the benchmark and absolutely crushed its Zack Subindustry's -28% performance.Volvo's strong performance in recent years while other automakers struggled has been very impressive and this could continue based on the company's valuation.Shares of VLVLY trade at $19 and 11.1X forward earnings which is nicely below its industry average of 13.1X and the S&amp;P 500's 17.7X. Volvo stock also trades 65% below its five-year high of 31.7X and slightly below the median of 11.4X.TakeawayThe EV growth of Volvo is very intriguing and the strong February numbers are starting to reaffirm that 2023 could be another stellar year for the company. While there are many companies competing in the EV space Volvo is one that investors will not want to overlook as the company has a strong track record of automotive engineering that dates back to 1927.Bear of the Day:MicroStrategy currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and there could be more short-term weakness ahead for the business intelligence company despite the Computer – Software Industry being in the top 28% of over 250 Zacks Industries.Furthermore, some longer-term risks will also need to be monitored as MicroStrategy has struggled with profitability over the last few years and has burned through a considerable amount of cash from reinvesting in its enterprise analytics software and services business.Cash Crunch  Amid high inflation and broader economic concerns, investors may want to stay away from companies with weaker balance sheets. Unfortunately, MicroStrategy appears very risky in this regard with only $51 million in cash on hand compared to $567 million in 2019.While newer or startup tech companies get the benefit of the doubt in terms of cash flow and shoring up the balance sheet, MicroStrategy was founded in 1989 and has been public since 1998 making its cash crunch an indication that its business is ailing.EPS &amp; Poor PerformanceMicroStrategy's earnings are expected to be back in the black this year at $2.10 per share compared to an astonishing adjusted loss of -$124.61 a share in 2022. However, fiscal 2023 earnings estimate revisions have dropped 35% throughout the quarter and FY24 estimates have declined 27%.Adding fuel to the fire is MicroStrategy's poor performance over the last few years. Despite being up +62% year to date, MicroStrategy stock is still down -70% over the last two years to largely underperform the S&amp;P 500's -4% and the Nasdaq's -15%.Bottom LineWith earnings estimates revisions declining and a limited amount of cash remaining the rally in MicroStrategy stock this year appears overdone. Investors will want to be cautious of MicroStrategy stock which currently trades over $200 per share and question the premium they are paying for the company.Additional content:Investors Can't Get Enough of These 3 Tech StocksThis morning, investors were finally served the main course of the week, February's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.As we've all become aware, CPI releases have become pivotal for markets, especially following a historical year-long tightening campaign aimed at cooling an overheated economy.Core CPI (which doesn't include food and energy prices) Y/Y came in at 5.5%, meeting expectations and reflecting the smallest 12-month increase since December 2021.Further, the headline CPI came in at 6% Y/Y, again meeting expectations and representing the smallest Y/Y climb since September 2021.All in all, good news for the Fed, with stocks finding buyers early in the trading session following the release.However, several large-cap tech stocks have had no issue finding buyers all year long, outperforming the broader market by notable margins. This is illustrated in the chart below.For those interested in riding momentum, let's take a closer look at each one.Meta PlatformsThe tech titan META presently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings estimates increasing across all timeframes.The market liked META's latest quarterly report in early February, with the tech giant announcing a sizable $40 billion share buyback program.The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 40% and posted sales 3% ahead of expectations, sending shares flying. The green arrow in the chart below illustrates this.However, what the market really appreciated was news of cost-cutting measures; the company expects full-year 2023 total expenses in a range of $89 billion – $95 billion, down from prior views of $94 billion – $100 billion.SalesforceSalesforce is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management software, enabling organizations to better manage critical operations. CRM presently sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Like META, Salesforce posted notably strong results in its latest quarterly release, beating bottom line expectations by more than 25% and reporting revenue 5% above expectations. Below is a chart illustrating the company's revenue on a quarterly basis.Investors cheered on the results, with CRM shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings.Analog DevicesAnalog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal-processing integrated circuits. Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company's earnings outlook.ADI shares trade at a nice discount relative to historic levels, with the current 17.2X forward earnings multiple sitting well beneath the 21.1X five-year median and highs of 23.5X in 2022.In addition, ADI shares provide exposure to technology paired with an income stream; ADI's annual dividend presently yields 1.9%, nicely above the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Bottom LineWhile buyers step up following the release of CPI data, all three stocks above – Meta Platforms, Salesforce and Analog Devices – have found many buyers all year long, widely outperforming the general market.For those interested in targeting stocks displaying relative strength paired with rising earnings estimate revisions, all three deserve consideration.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

251,e98d7e4a-85d0-3d35-9514-71616f3513f5,V,2023-03-16,Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-favoured-130019914.html,1678971619,STORY,['V'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Visa implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Insiders have been selling lately If you want to know who really controls Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Visa. Check out our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Visa, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Visa is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.1% and 3.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of VisaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Visa Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$234m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Visa. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Visa has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the travel industry’s outlook, and go directly to the 5 Best Hotels in Canada.Travel and tourism experienced a revival in 2022, and despite rising costs globally, there are no indications that demand for travel will decrease. Travelers are feeling significantly more optimistic about traveling in 2023 than they did in 2022, according to a global survey by Booking.com. Approximately 72% of respondents think that traveling is always desirable despite a number of difficulties, such as inflation and ongoing geopolitical unrest.A Forbes survey found that 49% of Americans intend to travel more in 2023. Younger respondents are more likely to travel this year, with 59% of those between the ages of 18 and 26. About half of those surveyed said they planned to spend more on travel in 2023 than they did last year. The majority of respondents anticipate spending around $4,000 or more on travel over the year.Even in the face of economic upheaval, Americans continue to travel. As per The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) report, international tourist arrivals are expected to reach 80% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels this year. The ongoing recovery is a result of the significant pent-up demand for foreign travel along with the current relaxation or removal of travel restrictions. Nonetheless, the report claimed that because of financial concerns, travel patterns will be impacted. Domestic and regional travel demand is anticipated to remain high and support the sector's broader recovery. According to the report, the Middle East and Europe will see the biggest growth in travel demand. This year, travel and tourism in these two regions are anticipated to reach pre-pandemic levels.The hotel industry is also expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels this year as a result of rising international tourist arrivals. According to the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association’s 2023 State of the Hotel Industry Report, state and local tax revenue from hotels is predicted to increase to $46.71 billion in 2023 from $41.11 billion in 2019.Story continuesCanadian Hotel Industry: An AnalysisAccording to an industry analysis report by CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE), an American commercial real estate services and investment firm, Canadian hotel industry will return to pre-pandemic revenues in 2023. The firm anticipates national Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), a key indicator of hotel performance, to grow 11% to hit a high of $107 this year. Strong leisure travel and the ongoing recovery of US overnight visits are the main drivers of this growth. However, there are still difficulties with travel from several important markets, particularly the Asia/Pacific region.The analysis also said that that leisure demand in Eastern Canada is anticipated to remain high, with overall RevPAR forecast to increase 12% in 2023 to reach $114. Quebec, and specifically Montreal, is expected to drive the region's growth. Western Canada, on the other hand, is expected to see RevPAR gains of 11% to finish at $104.Another report by Mordor Intelligence estimates that the Canada hospitality market has generated a revenue of $22 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% from 2019 through 2028. The significant recovery in the hospitality sector in Canada has aroused the interest of investors who predict ongoing income growth in the near- to mid-term.Some of the top international brands holding a sizable portion of the Canadian hospitality market include Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH), Choice Hotels International, Inc. (NYSE:CHH), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR). As of February 15, 2023, Marriott International, Inc.

258,f735096a-3ae6-3fd2-9bf0-206d9c23d202,SNA,2023-03-16,Why Snap-On (SNA) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-snap-sna-top-dividend-154503780.html,1678895103,STORY,['SNA'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Snap-On in FocusHeadquartered in Kenosha, Snap-On (SNA) is a Consumer Discretionary stock that has seen a price change of 5.37% so far this year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.62 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.69% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.22% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.77%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.61%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Snap-On's current payout ratio is 39%. This means it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, SNA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.10 per share, with earnings expected to increase 1.66% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SNA presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Management is on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives.This led to a robust surprise trend, which continued in fourth-quarter 2022, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It marked the 10th straight earnings beat and the 11th consecutive sales surprise. Earnings and sales improved year over year.Adjusted earnings of $4.42 per share improved 7.8% from earnings of $4.10 reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales grew 4.3% to $1,155.9 million driven by organic sales growth of 8%, partly offset by $37.7 million of negative impacts of foreign-currency translations. Sales and organic sales grew 21% and 22.7%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.Adjusted gross profit grew 5.1% year over year. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 48.5%. The upside was backed by higher sales volume and gains from the RCI initiatives, which more than offset higher material and other costs.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $248 million, up 6.8% year over year.As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 50 bps to 21.5% in the fourth quarter.Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $311.9 million, up 4.2% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings were flat year over year at 25.1%.Other Factors Driving the StockSNA remains on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs, besides helping in boosting sales and margins, and generating savings. Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from continuous productivity and process improvement plans.Management intends to boost customer services, and enhance manufacturing and supply-chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments.Snap-on’s ability to innovate bodes well. The company has been investing in new products and increasing brand awareness across the world.Robust business model helps in enhancing the value-creation processes, which improves safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation. The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, namely enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers, and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has gained 6.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.4%.Wrapping UpDespite these upsides, the company continues to reel under macroeconomic headwinds, which are likely to persist in 2023. Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses and increased transportation costs, is likely to remain a deterrent. Also, unfavorable currency movements are concerning.All said, Snap-on’s cost-cutting efforts, RCI plan and solid business momentum are likely to help sustain its momentum and offset inflation and currency woes. The earnings estimate for the current financial year have increased by a penny to $17.1 over the past 30 days. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 7% reflects its inherent strength.Have a Look at These PicksHere we have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks.BJ's Wholesale Club BJ operates warehouse clubs.

The company is also publicly releasing the DLSS Frame Generation plug-in to further ease developer adoption of the technology.“Neural graphics has revolutionized gaming since its introduction with NVIDIA DLSS, and we’re now taking it to new heights,” said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. “PC gaming super-franchises such as Diablo and Forza Horizon and Bethesda’s new Redfall are raising the bar for image quality with stunning graphics while using DLSS to keep gameplay smooth as silk.”Since its launch in 2018, NVIDIA DLSS has driven a neural graphics revolution in PC gaming. Neural graphics intertwines AI and graphics to create an accelerated rendering pipeline that continuously learns and improves. Instead of natively rendering every pixel in a frame, DLSS allows the game to render 1/8th of the pixels then uses AI and GeForce RTX™ Tensor Cores to reconstruct the rest of the pixels, dramatically multiplying frame rates, while delivering crisp, high-quality images that rival native resolution.Diablo IV, Forza Horizon 5, Redfall — DLSS 3 is in the Biggest Games and Biggest FranchisesTo date, over 270 games and applications use NVIDIA DLSS as an AI-powered performance accelerator. DLSS 3, the latest version of the technology, is available in 28 released games and has been adopted 7x faster than DLSS 2 in the first six months of their respective launches.Story continuesAmong the highly anticipated games being added to the DLSS roster is Forza Horizon 5, named the best open-world racing game of all time by several media outlets and currently holding the highest rating of any racing game tracked by OpenCritic. Forza Horizon 5, which already supports ray tracing, will update to DLSS 3 on March 28.Redfall, Bethesda’s highly anticipated, open-world, co-op first-person shooter from Arkane Austin, the award-winning team behind Prey and Dishonored, is launching on May 2 with DLSS 3.In addition, Diablo IV, the latest installment of the genre-defining Diablo franchise — multiple games of which are considered among the best of all time — will be launching on June 6 with DLSS 3.“Supporting smooth gameplay in Diablo IV is a priority for Blizzard,” said Michael Bukowski, Diablo IV technical director at Blizzard Entertainment. “We’re excited by the high frame rate of Diablo IV running on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series hardware and DLSS 3.”Additional PC games announcing support of NVIDIA DLSS at GDC include Deceive Inc., Gripper, Smalland: Survive the Wilds and THE FINALS. View the complete list of 270 games and apps that support DLSS.DLSS Frame Generation Publicly Available for Developers at GDCNVIDIA will make DLSS Frame Generation plug-ins publicly available during GDC, allowing even more developers to integrate the framerate boosting technology into their games and applications.DLSS Frame Generation will be available to access via NVIDIA Streamline, an open-source, cross-vendor framework that simplifies the integration of super-resolution technologies in 3D games and apps.DLSS technology is always improving through ongoing training on NVIDIA’s AI supercomputer. The public release will incorporate the latest DLSS enhancements made earlier this year, including:DLSS Frame Generation takes better advantage of game engine data, improving user interface stability and image quality during fast movement.DLSS Super Resolution improves Ultra Performance mode, with finer detail stability and overall better image quality.DLAA improves image quality, reduces ghosting and improves edge smoothness in high-contrast scenarios.Unreal Engine 5.2 Integration, Adding DLSS 3 to Unreal Engine Games Simpler Than Ever NVIDIA and Epic announced the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 into the popular Unreal Engine (UE) game engine. Unreal Engine is an open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool that gives game developers and creators the freedom and control to deliver cutting-edge real-time 3D content, interactive experiences and immersive virtual worlds. The DLSS 3 plug-in will debut in UE 5.2, making it simpler for any developer to accelerate the performance of their game or application.“NVIDIA DLSS 3 introduces truly impressive frame generation technology and the Unreal Engine 5.2 plug-in will offer developers a great choice for increased quality and performance of their games,” said Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering at Epic Games.About NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

Looked at another way, Netflix's stock has tanked 9.3% since the pricing announcement compared to a 2.5% drop for the S&amp;P 500.The company slashed prices by 50% in about 100 smaller overseas markets such as Slovenia and Jordan, representing 6% of its subscriber base, according to Citi research. Roughly 60% of the markets were in Europe and the Middle East and Africa region, while 20% each came in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America.Citi analyst Jason Bazinet thinks the price cuts reflect the pending ""global enforcement of password sharing."" By lowering prices, Bazinet says, Netflix may be aligning the retail price of a subscription with the utility each user derives from the service.Whatever the reason, Bazinet believes Netflix's decision isn't sitting well with investors as it could weigh on profit margins and free cash flow.""We believe such dramatic price reductions across so many markets confused the Street,"" Bazinet says.

285,d565ee7f-4be8-3c3c-9e74-37cada2ba8fd,DIS,2023-03-16,2 Stocks to Buy with Strong Economic Moats,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-buy-strong-economic-192307163.html,1678908187,STORY,"['OTIS', 'DIS']","[What is an “economic moat?” A term widely popularized by Warren Buffett; it describes a business’ unique competitive advantage. Moats function to protect long-term profits. They come in many forms such as geographical location, technological edge, and brand among others.The simplest example of a moat is a geographical one. Something like a port, used for shipping and trade is a very powerful competitive advantage. Businesses that own a port have the distinct advantage of a geographical monopoly. If someone wants to move freight over water and do so through that location, they have no other option than to do so though the business’ port.Another way of defining a moat is a monopoly. The competitive advantage for some reason or another makes it is incredibly hard if not impossible to knock the incumbent from their dominant position.Below I cover two stocks for investors to consider each with its own distinct moat.Otis WorldwideOtis Worldwide OTIS is one of the leading elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation, and service companies in the world. The company operates in two segments, New Equipment and Service. The New Equipment segment designs, manufactures, sells, and installs a range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators. The Service segment performs maintenance and repair services, as well as modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. OTIS was originally founded in the 1800s before it was acquired in the 1970s. Otis was most recently spun off as its own company in 2020. The elevator business is no longer a rapidly growing industry, but because of its dominance, difficulty of entry, very long-term business contracts, and competitive advantage Otis is a very appealing stock.The moat for Otis Worldwide is multipronged. The elevator business has many barriers to entry. Building elevators is extremely capital intensive, complicated. There is also some liability risk involved considering how devastating an elevator related accident can be. Otis, as one of the oldest and largest producers of elevators, is the most recognizable name in the industry. So it has a technological advantage in the actual production, and a branding advantage as the most reputable name in the business.Story continuesAdditionally, elevators are installed and left in buildings for very long periods of time, decades usually. So long as a building stands there is no reason to change elevators. This provides the next competitive advantage, which is the very extended contracts. Elevators require regular maintenance and repairs, and who better to do so than the people that built them. These cashflows exist so long as the building functions and uses its elevators.With slowdowns in the economy likely on the horizon, OTIS sales forecasts are expecting a near-term slowdown in growth. Current quarter sales are expected to decline -4% to $3.3 billion, but are expected to reaccelerate as next quarter, current year and next year sales are expected to flip back to growth. Earnings expectations are expected to follow the same path.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOtis is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 24x, which is below its three-year median of 26x. OTIS also offers a dividend yield of 1.4%, which it has raised by an average of 20% annually for the last three years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisneyMedia and amusement park conglomerate Disney DIS has a particularly unique and powerful economic moat. Disney, is of course, known for its media franchises, studio capabilities, parks and direct to consumer streaming app, Disney+.Disney’s brand is known around the world, and it is thanks to its brilliant flywheel. Children watch Disney movies and become familiar with characters, series, and movies. Their parents bring them to the parks where they have the time of their lives on rides while also meeting the characters from movies. Then they go home and watch Disney content, more connected to the characters than ever. When they grow older and have children of their own the cycle starts again.Disney is creating content for the adults now too. With Marvel and Star Wars franchises, DIS can entertain the whole family. There are few if any businesses that have connected to people the way Disney has, and that recognition, and those timeless stories and characters are its economic moat.Disney has been publicly traded since 1962, and its returns since then are astronomical. DIS stock has returned some 80,000% since 1962, which is 20% annualized over 60 years. Over the last 20 years, the performance has been strong as well, but a bit slower than the early years, compounding at about 10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisney currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the near term earnings estimates have been revised lower. It should be noted that both next quarter and next year have been revised higher recently.Current quarter sales are expecting to climb 15% higher, while earnings are projected to drop -13%. Looking farther out all other projections look promising. Next year sales are expected to grow 7%, and earnings are expected to jump 36%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter the release of Disney Plus, along with the mania that followed the Covid pandemic, Disney was bid up to unreasonable levels. Since then the stock has corrected over 50%, and valuations have become more reasonable. Disney is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 23x, which is above its 10-year median of 19x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionProtect your profits and protect your portfolio with stocks that have significant competitive advantage. Of course, that isn’t always the simplest thing as even stocks with considerable moats deal with periodic mismanagement, and deep drawdowns. These are stocks that should be held for the long term, and you really have to understand what the competitive advantage is, and make sure it is maintained. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In 2022, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index outperformed its American counterpart, falling by 8.5% as of December 30, 2022, compared with a much harsher 19% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Even with this outperformance, analysts are expecting the Canadian economy to contract this year. According to a report by Deloitte, a US recession will take down Canadian economic growth for three consecutive quarters, with an expected overall contraction of 0.9%. However, this recession will be relatively mild in comparison with the previous market downturns, the professional services company noted. This current stock market’s condition has called for investment in dividend equities because they can generate stable income for investors.According to a report by RBC Global Asset Management, dividends have represented 30% of the total return from the Canadian equity market. The report also mentioned that dividends accounted for 39% of the market’s total return over the last 10 years. In the current environment, it is imperative to gauge the performance of dividend stocks relative to inflation. The report by the same capital market company highlighted that the S&amp;P/TSX Dividends delivered an annual average return of 7.9% in the last 20 years, widely outpacing inflation which returned at an annual average rate of 2.2%.Overall, dividend stocks in Canada have shown a strong performance in comparison to their peers. Especially companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period remained big winners. Another report published by RBC revealed that dividend growers delivered a compound annual return of 10.8% from 1986 to 2022, compared with a 9.1% return from the dividend-payers. During this period, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index returned 6.2%, falling behind dividend growers by a wide margin. The report has additionally mentioned that dividend growers have displayed less volatility of 13.3% during this period, compared with a 23.4% volatility of non-dividend stocks.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So while Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Colgate-Palmolive is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 31%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 13%. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceIn the above chart we have measured Colgate-Palmolive's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Colgate-Palmolive.So How Is Colgate-Palmolive's ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Colgate-Palmolive doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 42%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.In Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And with the stock having returned a mere 19% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Colgate-Palmolive that you might find interesting.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(and why it's never moved away); increasing access to financial services for people who may have systemic barriers to using those products; and why the pandemic was an accelerant for new ideas.Listen to the episode or read the full transcript below.TranscriptAlan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte, who, like me, are super focused on how CEOs can lead in the context of disruption and evolving societal expectations.Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray. And I'm here with the amazing Ellen McGirt, who is the rock of Leadership Next. You know why I'm saying that Ellen?Ellen McGirt: I know what you're doing there, Alan. Yes I do. You're so clever. Such a wordsmith. Thank you for that beautiful greeting. And I'm so excited to say that one of my newly favorite CEOs is in the studio with you today, Charlie Lowrey of Prudential Financial, and I'm a little jealous that you're spending time with him because I, I wasn't able to make it into the studio today. But I was able to have breakfast with Charlie recently, which was a great experience, not only because it was the first power breakfast I've had since the pandemic, but because this is Leadership Next, it was definitely a new power kind of conversation.Murray: Are you going to explain the rock? Are you just going to leave me hanging out there? You want me to do it?McGirt: Yeah, yeah.Murray: It's the Rock of Gibraltar, which for almost 150 years has been the symbol of Prudential. I'm not sure there are many advertising symbols that have persisted for that long. Charlie is, as I just said, the CEO of one of the oldest companies we've ever had on Leadership Next. Prudential was founded in 1875 as an insurance provider for everyday American families.Story continuesMcGirt: Well, I was just going to say that, in the last 150 years or so, Prudential is everywhere. They've grown to have offices all over the world and provide investment management and other financial services, along with insurance. And fun fact: I learned that they had, they actually had more employees in Japan than they do in the U.S., Alan.Murray: Which is fascinating. And Charlie and Ellen, the other thing that impresses me is, Prudential is one of those companies that has remained committed, firmly committed to its hometown, to Newark, New Jersey. We're going to talk about all of that, we'll get into it. But let me first formally welcome you to Leadership Next, Charlie, and get you to tell us a little bit about what Prudential is today.Charles Lowrey: I am just delighted to be here with you. So, Prudential is an international company, almost 50% of our revenues come from international operations. Ellen, as you said, we have a large operation in Japan, in Latin America, and the rest of Asia, in Africa as we go forward. But we are a purpose-driven company, first of all, and our purpose is to make lives better by solving financial challenges of a changing world. That is what drives us every day. And we do that through our strategy of expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement security. And we chose the two words ""expanding access"" very carefully, because those words really go back to our roots of what John Dryden wanted when he came to the United States to—Alan, as you said—form the company in 1875, which was to provide dignity to working class families to be able to bury their loved ones. And he felt very strongly about that. That same sentiment is carried over today. Now today, we have 50 million customers in 40 countries around the world. But the point is that we still have that purpose as we go forward. And that's, that's in large part who we are.McGirt: You became CEO at the end of 2018. You and I have talked about and Alan, there's a clue in here for you as well, that you and the board leadership were in agreement that a total transformation was necessary. And you were thinking about not just to address the short-term pain, which includes low interest rates—Alan, that's the clue for you—but bigger growth and market opportunities. And you mentioned that the strategy you designed had both a business purpose, but also had a purpose purpose. Perhaps you could just walk us through what that strategy was and how it's playing out in the years since then.Lowrey: When we took over, we decided that we needed to have a different strategy. And that strategy was to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble company. Because what we said is, we've almost been—we've been in existence for almost 150 years, that doesn't give us the right to be around for another 150 years. We have to earn that right every single day. The context of our operation was changing, our competition was changing, our customers are changing. You think about the demographic, they're now demanding to have their solutions and their products when, where, and how they want. So there's a technological transformation that needed to take place. So we knew we had to take the best parts of Prudential and keep them, but change—Ellen, to your point—a lot of other things in order to respond to both the context, the competitive context and to our customers as we went forward.Murray: And where are you on that journey at this point, Charlie?Lowrey:  It's a long journey, but we are deeply into it. So we've sold a number of businesses, we bought other businesses, we've cut our expense space, we're modifying products. We're in the midst of that transformation, Alan.Murray: I want to go back to the Newark question, because over the course of the nearly 150 years you've been in existence, we've seen a lot of companies, global companies, abandon their original hometowns, move to other places because it was convenient, because the tax treatment was better, because the environment was better. Newark is a tough city, and Prudential has stuck with it and invested pretty heavily in it. Why?Lowrey: Because it's our home. We have always been there. We've been committed to the city. It is a wonderful city in so many ways. And it is core to our purpose, when you think about it. So I'll give you an example. During the pandemic, we hit three $1 billion marks. We gave away our billionth dollar from our foundation. Our impact investing portfolio hit a billion dollars. And we invested our billionth dollar in Newark. And so if you think about our purpose and the importance of the purpose to our employees, being able to support the communities in which you live and work is a fundamental part of that purpose. And what greater community than Newark? So they look at what we do—and believe me, employees look at what we do all the time—and they see our commitment to the city, they see our commitment to the cultural institutions, the educational institutions, a variety of other things, housing, etc., etc. And they take huge pride in that, and they get involved in it. We have hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours of employees that get involved in their communities, but many of them choose to get involved in Newark. It's a big part of who we are.Murray: If I can follow up on that, in the years after World War II, there were, you know, quite a few companies like that. You could point to a Xerox and Rochester or Cummins Engines in Indiana, or quite a few companies that were identified with the cities that they were located in and most of those are gone. Why haven't other companies stuck to that kind of a commitment to their home, as you put it?Lowrey: I don't know. But there are many that have—Cummins Engine is one, Ford in Detroit, who has taken over the the old train station, I think and it's turning that into their headquarters. There are many companies that have chosen to stay and support the communities in which they sort of were raised, if you will. And I think that's an important part of the ethos of those companies. It's not to say that other companies who move are wrong. It's just to say that for those companies that have chosen to stay, there's a special relationship between their hometown and who they are.Murray: And their purpose.Lowrey: Yeah, absolutely.McGirt: So let's talk a little bit about increasing access to people who haven't typically been invited to think about a retirement plan or are unfamiliar with financial services or have been underrepresented in all the ways that we know people have been. What have you learned in the last few years about reaching those people? About overcoming their skepticism and about helping them build a financial future?Lowrey: Ellen, so many things. And part of it comes through the education that we do for customers and for potential customers. Part of it comes through technology, and being able to reach those customers in different ways. And part of it comes through solutions, providing simplified solutions, which are tailored for certain socioeconomic demographics. So, you know, many people don't need super complex products that are distributed by highly sophisticated financial advisors. What they need are simplified products that are affordable, that they can relate to, and that they can have access to quickly. So with our simplified insurance as an example, what used to take 22 days now takes 22 seconds. You can go online, you can get a policy, you can understand that policy, and you can have it much more quickly. That expands access to more people by virtue of reach and by virtue of the product itself.McGirt: Charlie, I wanted to ask you about the pandemic. It was a terrible time for everyone, but so many companies that we've spoken to have found like, a kind of speed to execution of new ideas and new solutions that they didn't expect. What was that like for you?Lowrey: That's exactly right. It was, as awful as a pandemic was and remains, it was also an accelerant. So if you had asked us, can you go remote, fully remote? And ask that question before the pandemic, we would have put together a cross-functional team, spent two years studying, and deemed it impossible. And yet we did it within 48 hours. Fifty thousand people, 40 countries, 48 hours, we were fully remote. And that was an extraordinary proof point to all our employees of the art of the possible, what you can actually do. And as we moved through the pandemic, especially in the early days, when people, customers were scared, they were calling in, you know. We had we had delays in terms of being able to answer their calls. We actually created chatbots, we created new ways of reaching out to customers in record time. And all of a sudden employees realize that they could do more, and they could do it faster. And that was one of the great parts about the pandemic, if you can say there's a great part about it. And we were convinced that what we were doing was right, and that we could continue that as we went forward. So as we think about our overarching goal, again, to be higher growth, less market sensitive and more nimble, this fits squarely in the more nimble part of our overarching goal of what we want to become.Murray: And have you been able to keep that nimbleness as the pandemic passed?Lowrey: We've been able to keep a large part of it, yes. There was an urgency that came from fear early on. And what we're trying to do is, is lessen the fear and keep the urgency, if you will.[Music starts]Murray: I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, the CEO of Deloitte and the sponsor of this podcast for all of its seasons. Thank you for that, Joe.Joe Ucuzoglu: Pleasure to be here, Alan.Murray: Something big seems to be going on in the world of business. There's a shift from a focus on shareholders to a focus on stakeholders. I'm hearing this everywhere. Why is it happening?Ucuzoglu: This is a realization that if you effectively serve a broad cross section of stakeholders, that's actually conducive to generating a premium return for shareholders. This is not an either/or. Maybe in the short term, one could prioritize profits at the expense of other constituents. But in the long term, you have to align those interests to deliver premium shareholder returns consistently.Murray: A lot of people I talk to want to know, is this real, or is this just a public relations exercise?Ucuzoglu: This is being built into the core of leading companies strategies, and you're seeing the landscape shift drastically. Views from leading investors around the way in which this is driving capital allocation decisions, very tangible climate commitments for many large organizations, and a very significant interest from our employee base around their desire to make certain that the organization they work for aligns with their values.Murray: Joe, thanks for being with us.Ucuzoglu: Alan, it's a real pleasure.[Music ends]Murray: You know, we were talking a few minutes ago about your purpose, which has been there for the company since its beginning almost 150 years ago. The commitment to providing access to ordinary working people to necessary financial products, your commitment to Newark and helping a city that has had its share of troubles try and stay on its feet. Today all of that comes under the initials of ESG, which, for a while was a popular trend in the investing markets, but now is subject to all this political pushback. You have governors in Florida and Georgia who are attacking investment companies like yours that use ESG principles. You have state attorney generals in red states who are saying don't do your ESG investing here. How do you think about that?Lowrey: If you take a step back and ask ourselves what we'll do—this is a roundabout way to get to the answer—and ask ourselves, what what do we really do? We create long-term promises. Those long-term promises are measured in decades—50, 60, 70 years. We sell you an insurance policy. You need to have the trust in us that we're going to be here in 70 years to fulfill that policy. So we think in decades. How do we do that? Because we have to create a sustainable company that is sustainable through the cycles.So let's break ESG down for a minute. So if you look at E, the environment, we need to know that the world is going to be here in 50 years. You need to know it's going to be here. So we're going to support, we're going to support efforts both within Prudential and outside of Prudential to make sure that the world is better and it's here in 50 years. That means climate change, it means a whole variety of things.If you look at the S, it means the societies and the communities in which we work. So we're going to invest in those societies, we're going to invest in communities, we're going to support racial equity, we're going to do all those things.And then if you look at G, there are two parts to G. One is good governance, so having a governance framework by which we can run the company and make sure that it is a sustainable franchise for the next 150 years. The other part of G has to do with the governance in terms of DE and I, right? Diversity, equity, and inclusion. So that starts at the board level. We have one of the most diverse boards in the in the country. And as of September was 82%, diverse. We have diversity modifiers we put into place. We started that in 2017, long before George Floyd and BLM and everything else. We have a whole series of commitments, racial equity commitments that we put into place to make sure that our workforce mirrors the demographic of the country, because we're serving the customers we want. So when you break it down and look at the ESG, the components and depoliticize it, it's about creating sustainability, and a sustainable company so that we can fulfill our long-term promises.Murray: Yeah, if I can follow up on that Ellen, I hear you. This is really just good long-term business. You have to care about the environment. You have to care about the stability of the communities you're operating in. You have to make sure that you're taking advantage of the full talents of the workforce, and not just a portion of that. But you also have to have a stable, accepting political environment. And what do you do at a moment like now, when you have, you know, the governor of Florida and a candidate for the presidency, saying people who talk about ESG like you are woke CEOs? How do you stay out of that political crossfire? How do you create a political environment that's sustainable in the long term?Lowrey: Well, we have employees, you know, we have red employees, we have blue employees, what we like to say is, we're not a red company, we're not a blue company, we're an American company. And as an American company, obviously, with international focus as well. But as the American side of it, we focus on our customers and we focus on what's doing right by our customers. And if we have the faith, that if we do that, and if we solely focus on our customers, we will be doing what's right for them, we'll be doing what's right for this country, and we'll be creating a strong culture and a strong company going forward. So we sort of put our heads down and seek to fulfill our purpose. And if we do that, we think we'll get through this.Murray: So you think all this anti-ESG noise is just going to go away?Lowrey: I don't think it's going to go away. But I think, again, if you focus on your purpose and you focus on doing right by your customers, you can get through it.McGirt: Alan, you know what I heard just there, I think he plans to sail right past it. You're one of the most unbothered CEOs I have ever met or spoken to.Murray: It could be rough sailing. There could be some rough sailing in there.McGirt: It's going to be tough, but yeah, I bet that's what he plans to do. I have sort of a philosophical question, you know, insurance at its form is such an interesting tool to manage risk in society, it's as old as dirt. You know, when it works well, it works beautifully. And when it doesn't, that's, you know, like any financial product, it's a huge problem. So I'm curious about you and your development as a leader and your development and your ascension into the C-suite at such a complex time for the economy, for people's lives, or our awareness of what's possible and what's not possible and the injustices in the world. And you're sort of in this really, incredibly important spot just moving forward, looking, thinking about purpose and thinking about using the tools that are at your collective fingertips to make the world better. So I'm curious if you have any advice or just any thoughts about how you've learned to think about risk writ large? Because at the end of the day, it feels to me like that's what you spend your time thinking about.Lowrey: I spend my time really doing three things. I think as a leader, at least for me, these are the three things that I focus on. One is setting the strategy of the company. The second is putting the right talent in the right seats in order to execute on that. And the third is then enabling that talent, being the servant leader, enabling that talent to do the best job they can. So Ellen, I think the key to your question about risk is having the right talent in place. Certainly you have to have a robust risk framework and governance framework, but at the end of the day, if you don't have a culture of people doing the right thing—and we talk about that constantly, of having an ethical culture and people doing the right thing—you can have all the governance in place and it doesn't matter, the risk framework. So what it boils down to is the quality of the people you have, and the attitude they have on always doing the right thing for the customer.Murray: That's really interesting, and not what I was thinking as I was listening to you is, is it an advantage that you're not in New York City? Is it better to be in Newark in order to establish the kind of culture that you're trying to establish, and not necessarily get caught up in the cultural norms of the financial center?Lowrey: I would argue not. I think there are plenty of ethical companies in New York City. I think it gets back to the roots of the company and the culture of the company, and the culture you're trying to create over time. I think Prudential has a very, very special culture, and we attract a certain type of person to come that is competitive, that is smart, but also is absolutely 100% committed to doing right by the customer. That is our ethos. That is our purpose. That is what we do.Murray: Let me dive a little deeper into the Charlie Lowrey story if we can. You didn't start out as an insurance guy, you wanted to be an architect. How did you get into this place?Lowrey: Well, if you had asked me, my younger self, I would have looked at you and recoiled at the thought of being in business because I was going to be an architect. Careers both have a degree of serendipity to them, as well as a degree of non-linearity. So careers aren't linear. And so I started as an architect. I had my own firm after I went to both graduate and undergraduate in architecture. But having my own firm, I thought I needed some more business experience. So I went back to business school after four years to get more business experience with a thought of coming back into architecture. But then took a detour into investment banking to get more business experience for a few years, always with the idea of coming back into architecture. Thirteen years later, I was still in investment banking, when Prudential, who had been a client for 10 years, called and said, would you ever be like to be considered to come over and run our real estate investment management group? And I thought that would be fascinating, and so I did that, and the rest is history. I joke I haven't been able to keep a job at Prudential. I've been moved around a lot. But I've never would have thought in the beginning, Alan, to your point, that I would be in business at the end of the day.McGirt: So looking ahead, I don't want to spend too much time on the risks, you know, out in the world. But we do live in a rapidly changing world, lots of opportunity, lots of potential problems. How are you thinking about charting Prudential's course forward five years out, 10 years out? What are the some of the key things that we could be talking about in 10 years that would affirm that you were on the right track?Lowrey: So in 10 years, we hope to be a larger, and yet similarly sustainable, company as we go forward, that has a distinctive competitive advantage by which we can continue to grow. And we began to articulate that in the the fourth quarter of this year, by talking about the self-reinforcing business system. In other words, that the composition of businesses we have between insurance, retirement, and asset management, both domestically and internationally, are self reinforcing and will, by virtue of each of their success, create success in the other groups. And I'll give you just one specific example. In our retirement group, we did a pension risk transfer transaction with the largest in history in the third quarter, and that was for $8 billion. Those assets that we got through the retirement business are being managed by PGIM. So PGIM grew by $8 billion, our retirement group grew by $8 billion, and it was sort of it was self reinforcing. In addition, the extraordinary performance of our asset management group helps our insurance and retirement group, because they can price their products more attractively for our clients and therefore can grow more. So we are creating a self reinforcing business system, which we think, by virtue of the businesses we have, which others don't, that we will be able to compete effectively in the marketplace.Murray: I got a couple of quick questions before we let you go. Are you ready for these?Lowrey: I'm ready.Murray: First of all: Recession in 2023?Lowrey: No.McGirt: Here we go. Here we go.Lowrey: Sluggish landing but no recession.Murray: Inflation at the end of the year? Over or under 5%?Lowrey: Over.Murray: Over 5%. So we're stuck with it for a while. And given that, sluggish economy, inflation over 5%, where should I put my money?[Lots of laughter]Lowrey: I am not an investment advisor, so I'm not going to put my foot in that trap.McGirt: Have you considered an annuity, Alan?Murray: Oh, he converted you to a salesperson at your breakfast?McGirt: Well, it was the only insurance term I could just pull off the top of my head.Lowrey: I'm impressed.Murray: What good books have you read recently?Lowrey: Well, I've been on, and it wasn't because of this podcast, I've been on a purpose kick. So I read Mountains Beyond Mountains, Tracy Kidder's book about Paul Farmer. And then at a New York Times deal logic conference, I met a gentleman named Jake Wood, who created a book Once a Warrior, which was about his creation of Team Rubicon. It's quite an amazing story about bringing veterans purpose when they come back from service. And it's the largest veterans' volunteer organization in the country. I then read a book by Alan somebody, I forget his last name, about purpose and stakeholders, which I found, I actually found fascinating. And the first two chapters about going from Milton Friedman's ""greed is good,: essentially, that shareholders are everything to stakeholder capitalism, I found an amazing transformation, articulation of the transformation taking place.Murray: Well, I'm very proud to be in that collection of books. So thank you for that. Is it on your shelf there, Ellen? I can't tell. Is Tomorrow's Capitalist behind your head?McGirt: No. Usually I travel with it everywhere I go. You caught me short this time, it's never far from me. Also, I wrote the preface, so I do like to read that. The one thing I managed to get in on time in the last year.Murray: It was a beautiful preface. It's the only place in the book that we deal with sausage and eggs.McGirt: It's a joke. Charlie, since you're still talking, I thought, and it's something you just said sort of inspired me, if you wouldn't mind. I do find this remarkable, only because my beat is equity and inclusive leadership and race. It's been such an interesting few years. You stepped into the CEO role really prepared to embrace inclusion, to share power, to, you know, think very carefully about system design. I know how much time you spend just checking in with people across the organization about who's rising up through the organization [and] what do they need to succeed. And a lot of other leaders, good of heart, very smart, struggled there. It seemed like a tradeoff that they weren't necessarily prepared to make, or they just weren't fluent in the language of inclusion. What helped you get prepared to take that moment and run with it?Lowrey: I think it was my passion for talent. I, you know, I've always said, If I end up working one day for someone that I hired, I will have been, that will be the greatest success of my life. I don't know whether that will ever happen. But it shows that you want to hire really good people. And in order to have a really good workforce, it has to be both diverse and inclusive. And I'll say something that may be controversial, but diversity is easy, inclusion is hard. Diversity is about numbers, and you can get there. Creating an inclusive workforce, where everyone can bring their whole selves to work, and they feel heard and they feel useful, and they feel like they are being contributory to the purpose, that's hard. And so, my passion is to create both a diverse, but more importantly, an inclusive workforce. And if I can do that by the time I leave Prudential, I feel I will have succeeded.Murray: Fascinating conversation. Inspiring company. Purpose driven. Great history. I have great confidence you'll be around 150 years from now, and I can tell you Fortune is going to be around 150 years from now to cover you.Lowrey: Absolutely.

What Went Wrong?Ryan Reynolds-Backed Mint Is Bought by T-Mobile for $1.35 BillionCredit Suisse Reels After Top Shareholder Rules Out Raising StakeThe Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the US made the demand recently to TikTok’s owner, ByteDance Ltd., the people said, indicating that the Biden administration has given up on a security review that was intended to blunt potential Chinese influence regarding the app. They asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.Under the demand, Cfius would start a process to approve a buyer for TikTok’s US assets, according to one of the people. The objective would be to find a purchaser that could reconstruct the algorithm for the US operations, walling off access by the Chinese to US users and their data, the person said. There are a number of potential buyers who might be interested, including content companies, tech players and private equity, said the person.At the same time, ByteDance is determining whether to sue, the person said. A forced sale of TikTok’s operations under former President Donald Trump was stayed while the Biden administration reviewed the national security risks posed by the social media app.TikTok’s leadership has been discussing the possibility of separating from ByteDance Ltd., its Chinese parent, to help address concerns about national security risks, Bloomberg News reported. One person said TikTok’s owners could retain some form of ownership but through a passive structure.“If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn’t solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,” TikTok spokeswoman Maureen Shanahan said in a statement. “The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing.”Story continuesEarlier: TikTok Considers Splitting From ByteDance If US Deal FailsUnder the Cfius security review, the company agreed last year to implement a number of changes in a plan it calls Project Texas. The proposal includes bringing in American technology giant Oracle Corp. to host US user data and review its software, and appointing a three-person government-approved oversight board. Many of the moves are already under way.The Cfius divestiture demand signals that US regulators don’t think Project Texas goes far enough to address security concerns. The administration was unconvinced by TikTok’s proposal to add layers of oversight and separation from ByteDance, according to another person familiar with the matter.It administration’s stance would likely face renewed legal challenges — just as a similar attempted ban did under Trump. His Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, oversaw an agreement under which ByteDance would sell its American assets to the Oracle-led group, but the sale was delayed after the Chinese company scored a series of legal victories.Early on, the Biden administration asked a federal judge to pause a lawsuit over that ban while it reviewed its options.Still unclear is how Beijing would respond to a forced sale by TikTok’s owner, the world’s largest startup at a valuation of $220 billion and considered one of China’s highest profile companies abroad. The government in the past has indicated it would scrutinize such a deal carefully, for fear of data or algorithms ending up in foreign hands.TikTok itself could be valued at $40 billion to $50 billion based on social media multiples and other factors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz. TikTok has poured $1.5 billion into Project Texas, but the details have been met with skepticism on Capitol Hill as well.The move will only add to strain in the US relationship with China at a time when the two countries are already clashing over issues ranging from the fate of Taiwan to export controls of microchips to China’s strengthening partnership with Russia.The US National Security Council and the Treasury Department declined to comment on Wednesday night. The Justice Department declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported the Biden administration’s demand earlier Wednesday.US officials have been airing longstanding national security concerns about TikTok. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers in November that China’s government could use the app to control millions of users’ data or software, and its recommendation algorithm — which determines which videos users will see next — “could be used for influence operations if they so choose.”“Under Chinese law, Chinese companies are required to essentially — and I’m going to shorthand here — basically do whatever the Chinese government wants them to do in terms of sharing information or serving as a tool of the Chinese government,” Wray told the House Homeland Security Committee. “That’s plenty of reason by itself to be extremely concerned.”The issue had also become a focus of US lawmakers as part of intensified hawkishness against China. Several lawmakers had proposed bills that would ban TikTok in the US or force its sale.TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew has been asked to testify before a House committee next week about the app’s data privacy and security practices, and the company’s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.--With assistance from Alex Barinka, Daniel Flatley and Sara Forden.(Updates with additional reporting on Trump administration lawsuit, possible divestiture.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyNaples, Florida, Is Getting So Expensive That City Workers Can't Afford It72 Hours in Washington: How the Frenzied SVB Rescue Took ShapeDrugs in Orbit: One Startup’s Big Idea for MicrogravityGlencore CEO Rides Coal Windfall on the Way to a Low-Carbon World©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Micron (MU).Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 7.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MU Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 8.3% over the past month to -$2.28.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

FIS need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 21, 2023 $35.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Fidelity shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Fidelity is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Financial Transaction Services industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.39 per share to $1.20 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Fidelity right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

317,1d52b878-4595-37d9-809a-28ad26053ac4,AON,2023-03-16,"In the wake of Aon plc's (NYSE:AON) latest US$2.2b market cap drop, institutional owners may be forced to take severe actions",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wake-aon-plcs-nyse-aon-120445442.html,1678968285,STORY,['AON'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Aon implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 13 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Aon plc (NYSE:AON) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$2.2b. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 8.9% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Aon which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Aon. See our latest analysis for Aon ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Aon?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Aon does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Aon's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Aon. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. With 8.0% and 7.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and Massachusetts Financial Services Company are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Gregory Case directly holds 0.7% of the total shares outstanding.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AonThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Aon plc. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$684m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Aon. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Aon is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is concerning...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the travel industry’s outlook, and go directly to the 5 Best Hotels in Canada.Travel and tourism experienced a revival in 2022, and despite rising costs globally, there are no indications that demand for travel will decrease. Travelers are feeling significantly more optimistic about traveling in 2023 than they did in 2022, according to a global survey by Booking.com. Approximately 72% of respondents think that traveling is always desirable despite a number of difficulties, such as inflation and ongoing geopolitical unrest.A Forbes survey found that 49% of Americans intend to travel more in 2023. Younger respondents are more likely to travel this year, with 59% of those between the ages of 18 and 26. About half of those surveyed said they planned to spend more on travel in 2023 than they did last year. The majority of respondents anticipate spending around $4,000 or more on travel over the year.Even in the face of economic upheaval, Americans continue to travel. As per The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) report, international tourist arrivals are expected to reach 80% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels this year. The ongoing recovery is a result of the significant pent-up demand for foreign travel along with the current relaxation or removal of travel restrictions. Nonetheless, the report claimed that because of financial concerns, travel patterns will be impacted. Domestic and regional travel demand is anticipated to remain high and support the sector's broader recovery. According to the report, the Middle East and Europe will see the biggest growth in travel demand. This year, travel and tourism in these two regions are anticipated to reach pre-pandemic levels.The hotel industry is also expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels this year as a result of rising international tourist arrivals. According to the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association’s 2023 State of the Hotel Industry Report, state and local tax revenue from hotels is predicted to increase to $46.71 billion in 2023 from $41.11 billion in 2019.Story continuesCanadian Hotel Industry: An AnalysisAccording to an industry analysis report by CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE), an American commercial real estate services and investment firm, Canadian hotel industry will return to pre-pandemic revenues in 2023. The firm anticipates national Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), a key indicator of hotel performance, to grow 11% to hit a high of $107 this year. Strong leisure travel and the ongoing recovery of US overnight visits are the main drivers of this growth. However, there are still difficulties with travel from several important markets, particularly the Asia/Pacific region.The analysis also said that that leisure demand in Eastern Canada is anticipated to remain high, with overall RevPAR forecast to increase 12% in 2023 to reach $114. Quebec, and specifically Montreal, is expected to drive the region's growth. Western Canada, on the other hand, is expected to see RevPAR gains of 11% to finish at $104.Another report by Mordor Intelligence estimates that the Canada hospitality market has generated a revenue of $22 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% from 2019 through 2028. The significant recovery in the hospitality sector in Canada has aroused the interest of investors who predict ongoing income growth in the near- to mid-term.Some of the top international brands holding a sizable portion of the Canadian hospitality market include Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH), Choice Hotels International, Inc. (NYSE:CHH), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR). As of February 15, 2023, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), offering the most powerful portfolio in the industry with almost 33 brands, has 275 Marriott Group Hotels &amp; Resorts in Canada. The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, The Ritz-Carlton, and JW Marriott Parq Vancouver, some of the company's premier hotels in Canada, are discussed below.Now that we are familiar with the hotel industry In Canada, let’s get to our list of the 30 best hotels in Canada.Our MethodologyWe used a hotel-addict.com article titled ""50 Best Hotels in Canada"" to compile our list of the 30 best hotels in Canada. HotelAddict is a popular website to learn about everything related to hotels. In order to ascertain the best hotels, we only shortlisted the top 30 hotels mentioned in the article. We then assigned a score to every hotel in the article. For instance, a hotel receives a score of 30 if it is ranked #1 in the article. If it is ranked #2, the score is 29, and so on. We then cross-referenced the resultant list with articles from Curiocity, Condé Nast Traveler, Tripadvisor, and Travel + Leisure. After that, we averaged out the rankings to derive an average score for each hotel.For example, since Rosewood Hotel Georgia receives a score of 10 in HotelAddict, 30 in Curiocity, 16 in Condé Nast Traveler, 17 in Tripadvisor, and 29 in Travel + Leisure, its average score for the purpose of this article is 20.4.After replicating the process for every hotel, we chose the top 30 hotels based on their average score and ranked them from lowest to highest.Please note that a hotel did not obtain a score if it was not mentioned in an article.Best Hotels in CanadaDoublePHOTO studio/Shutterstock.comBest Hotels in Canada30.

322,a2793deb-0116-35fe-bbc1-9298ff720d6d,NWL,2023-03-16,Is Now An Opportune Moment To Examine Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-newell-112522202.html,1678965922,STORY,['NWL'],"[Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$16.47 and falling to the lows of US$11.82. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Newell Brands' current trading price of US$12.20 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Newell Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Newell Brands Is Newell Brands Still Cheap?Newell Brands appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Newell Brands’s ratio of 25.61x is above its peer average of 7.35x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Consumer Durables industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that Newell Brands’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Newell Brands generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Newell Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NWL’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NWL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWL for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NWL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Newell Brands at this point in time.

323,734bf280-0183-308d-ae9a-d0ac80eecfc7,TROW,2023-03-16,Is T. Rowe Price Global Stock (PRGSX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-global-stock-110011945.html,1678964411,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TROW']","[Have you been searching for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? You might want to begin with T. Rowe Price Global Stock (PRGSX). PRGSX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerPRGSX finds itself in the T. Rowe Price family, based out of Baltimore, MD. Since T. Rowe Price Global Stock made its debut in December of 1995, PRGSX has garnered more than $2.55 billion in assets. David Eiswert is the fund's current manager and has held that role since October of 2012.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 9%, and is in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 9.78%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, PRGSX's standard deviation comes in at 23.15%, compared to the category average of 18.76%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 20.56% compared to the category average of 16.3%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 1.02, the fund is likely to be as volatile as the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. PRGSX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -0.62, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.ExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, PRGSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.82% compared to the category average of 1.10%. So, PRGSX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Story continuesThis fund requires a minimum initial investment of $2,500, and each subsequent investment should be at least $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Global Stock ( PRGSX ) has a neutral Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Global Stock ( PRGSX ) looks like a somewhat average choice for investors right now.Don't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds. We also have plenty more on our site in order to help you find the best possible fund for your portfolio.

Since its relaunch, the company's high-value customers have increased by approximately 50%. These high -value customers shop more frequently and spend more money, thereby increasing sales of the company.TSCO announced its fiscal 2022 results wherein net sales increased 11.6% to $14.2 billion. The company stated that 75% of the sales during fiscal 2022 was contributed by Neighbor's Club Program and the program’s membership exceeded 28 million members.Tractor Supply announced expansion of the Neighbor's Club program with Petsense, one of the brands under TSCO. This expansion will deepen the relationship with existing customers and help attract new pet customers. The company noted that Neighbor's Club membership represented approximately 50% of sales at Petsense.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 20.8% in the past six months compared with the industry's 16.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Driving Growth?Tractor Supply is on track to build a new distribution center in Arkansas to support its expansion of supply chain and higher volumes in its existing stores. Post completion of its new distribution center in late 2023, management expects to generate 450 new full-time jobs and service about 250 stores at full capacity. On Jan 18, 2023, management also launched its largest and ninth distribution center located in Navarre, OH.Earlier, the company launched the field activity support team (FAST) and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise. FAST has made powerful contributions to the company’s in-stock performance and execution of its sales-driving initiatives.Given the changing consumer trends, Tractor Supply is focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience.The company is on track with the ONETractor strategy to connect stores and online shopping. Its e-commerce business witnessed mid-single-digit growth from the prior year. As of year-end, the Tractor Supply app has had over 4.4 million downloads since its launch.TSCO’s store expansion initiatives bode well. It is well-positioned to expand its store base. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company opened 39 Tractor Supply stores and six Petsense stores. During the said quarter, the company acquired 81 stores from Orscheln Farm and Home that will be rebranded to Tractor Supply by the end of 2023. Management is on track with its store-opening initiatives. It plans to open approximately 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.Driven by these factors, management announced compelling guidance for fiscal 2023. The view reflects the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home and the cost for new distribution center.For fiscal 2023, the company expects net sales in the range of $15.0-$15.3 billion, up from $14.20 billion reported in the prior period. Comps are likely to grow 3.5-5.5% on a year-over-year basis. The operating margin is anticipated to be 10.1-10.3%. Earnings per share is likely to be $10.30-$10.60, up from $9.71 reported in the previous period.Story continuesWrapping upTractor Supply has been facing challenging macro environment factors for a while now. The company has also been witnessing cost pressure across the supply chain. Management expects transportation costs to continue to be higher year over year in the first quarter of 2023 with recovery in the second half of 2023.Nonetheless, the upsides mentioned above will likely to help Tractor Supply to battle such hurdles.3 Solid PicksSome top-ranked stocks are Inter Parfums IPAR, The Kroger Co.

335,b104f8f1-4acc-3907-aaff-e8c3b9ffc84d,OXY,2023-03-16,Is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-nyse-oxy-using-120039097.html,1678968039,STORY,['OXY'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What Is Occidental Petroleum's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Occidental Petroleum had debt of US$19.1b at the end of December 2022, a reduction from US$29.8b over a year. However, it also had US$984.0m in cash, and so its net debt is US$18.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Occidental Petroleum's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$7.76b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$34.8b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$984.0m in cash and US$4.56b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$37.0b.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$51.1b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Occidental Petroleum's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Occidental Petroleum's net debt is only 0.88 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 24.4 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Better yet, Occidental Petroleum grew its EBIT by 213% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Occidental Petroleum can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last two years. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.Our ViewThe good news is that Occidental Petroleum's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Occidental Petroleum's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

Through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), the so-called “Oracle of Omaha” has amassed a huge investment portfolio that is today worth $333 billion.Warren Buffett is a classic value investor and discerning in his stock picks. He searches out companies that have a moat around their business and a durable competitive advantage. Additionally, he tends to focus on undervalued stocks, noted for his prescient stock purchases when markets are selling off. Indeed, this was certainly the case over the past year.And while Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends, Buffett prefers stocks that offer a quarterly payout to shareholders. Also known for concentrating his positions, Warren Buffett has said that when he finds a stock he likes, he buys as much of it as he can. This approach has made him the biggest shareholder in several important businesses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are eight stocks where Warren Buffett is the number one shareholder today.AXPAmerican Express$165.70BACBank of America$30.27CVXChevron$159.67KOCoca-Cola$59.21HPQHP Inc.$27.45MCOMoody’s$285.09OXYOccidental Petroleum$59.86PARAParamount Global$19.89American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockWarren Buffett has held positions in American Express (NYSE:AXP) since the 1960s. However, his current work in the credit card giant dates to the 1980s.Today, the Oracle of Omaha owns more than 150 million shares of AXP stock, worth $26 billion or about 20% of the company, making him its largest shareholder. The next largest shareholder, Vanguard, owns only 6% of American Express. Buffett has long been a fan of American Express and its business model, mainly because its credit cards are used for business and leisure pursuits.In interviews over the years, Buffett has expressed his admiration for American Express’ strong brand and customer loyalty. He also likes the fact that American Express caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, during recessionary environments, the company has managed to keep its bad loan totals down.Story continuesThese factors give American Express a wide moat around its core business, which is what Buffett looks for when deciding to take a position in a stock.Lastly, American Express is more diversified than other credit card issuers, having an end-to-end payments network that Buffett has singled out as beneficial to the company and its shareholders.Bank of America (BAC)As It Tests Support, Bank of America Stock Provides a Trading OpportunitySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett has long been a fan of bank stocks and has held positions in most major U.S. lenders at one time or another. However, his most prominent position in a bank stock is in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Berkshire Hathaway owns over one billion BAC stock shares, worth nearly $34 billion, amounting to a 12.9% stake in the lender. Bank of America is Berkshire Hathaway’s second-largest holding after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Its Bank of America position is 10% of Berkshire’s current portfolio.Buffett dramatically increased his Bank of America position in recent years, buying the stock hand-over-fist during the pandemic in 2020 when BAC stock fell below $20. The stock has since recovered, and is now trading above $30 per share. However, BAC stock is currently 27% below its 52-week high of $44.63, as it declined over the past year along with the broader market.That said, Buffett remains committed to Bank of America. While he has recently trimmed his position in other bank stocks, notably in US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Bank of America appears to be his long-term pick in this sector. That’s something all investors should take into consideration.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThe media tends to focus on Buffett’s other significant oil holdings, but Berkshire Hathaway is now the single largest shareholder in Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The company’s stake in Chevron grew steadily throughout 2022 as crude oil prices crested above $120 a barrel. Today, Berkshire owns more than 167 million shares of CVX stock, which comprises nearly 9% of the company and is valued at $27.55 billion. Berkshire’s Chevron holding makes up roughly 8.3% of the company’s overall portfolio.Warren Buffett had incredible foresight regarding Chevron, first buying the stock in mid-2020 before oil prices took off. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in CVX stock five-fold as crude prices increased following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Chevron’s share price has retreated alongside declining energy prices in recent months, and are now trading 14% lower than its 52-week high of $189.68 reached last November. However, Buffett, no doubt likes that Chevron pays a hefty quarterly dividend that currently yields 3.8%. Chevron has also used its windfall profits from the past year to launch a new $75 billion stock buyback program.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is arguably the stock Buffett is most associated with. Holding the same position in the Atlanta-based beverage giant since the late-1980s, Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million KO stock worth $24 billion, making up approximately 7.2% of Buffett’s portfolio.With a 9.2% ownership stake, Buffett is Coca-Cola’s largest shareholder. He’s also one of the biggest soft drink fans, so much so that he has had a Coke dispenser installed at Berkshire Hathaway’s head office in Omaha, Nebraska.In addition to being a reliable stock in good and bad economic times, Coca-Cola has also been a dividend powerhouse for Berkshire Hathaway. With a current dividend yield of 3.1% and a quarterly payout of 46 cents per share, Berkshire Hathaway will make $736 million from Coca-Cola’s dividend payments this year alone. No wonder Buffett frequently boasts that his investment in Coca-Cola has paid for itself many times over the past three decades.HP Inc.

While many people know Buffett’s biggest holding is tech giant Apple, few people would know that Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder of legacy tech company HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ).A personal computer and printer maker, HP has been in business since 1939, and the home where the company was founded in Palo Alto, California, has been designated as a historical landmark and marked with a plaque that reads: “Birthplace of ‘Silicon Valley.'”Buffett’s interest in HP’s stock likely has nothing to do with sentimentality. Berkshire Hathaway owns 120 million HPQ shares valued at $3.35 billion. While the HP stake makes up only 1% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, it constitutes 12.3% of Hewlett-Packard’s outstanding shares, making Buffett its largest shareholder.HP stock has been a bit of a laggard among tech firms, having risen only 14% over the last five years to $28 a share. However, the stock does pay a hefty dividend yield of 3.8%, with a quarterly payout of 26 cents per share.Moody’s (MCO)A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comLike most of Buffett’s stock holdings, credit rating agency Moody’s Corp. (NYSE:MCO) has a wide moat and durable competitive advantage. The New York City-based company is part of a duopoly with fellow credit rating agency S&amp;P Global Ratings (NYSE:SPGI). Currently, Moody’s and S&amp;P Global each control about 40% of the global market for credit ratings. This puts Moody’s in a strong position and makes it a solid long-term investment.Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 25 million shares of MCO stock, giving it a 13.5% stake in the credit rating agency and making it the company’s largest shareholder. Valued at $7.26 billion, Moody’s position accounts for 2.2% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.Indeed, Moody’s stock has been a solid performer for Buffett. The company’s share price is up 7% this year in what continues to be a volatile market, and it has gained 73% over the last five years to trade at $294 per share. Furthermore, Moody’s quarterly dividend of 77 cents a share (1% yield) provides another reason to get excited about this stock.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comNews just broke that Buffett is again buying shares of energy giant Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Regulatory filings show that Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 5.8 million oil company shares at the start of March, paying between $59.80 and $61.90 per share. The latest purchase means that Berkshire now owns 200 million shares of OXY stock, or 22% of the company, worth $12 billion based on the current share price of around $60.Occidental Petroleum is now among the top 10 holdings in Berkshire Hathaway’s $332 billion portfolio. Last year, Buffett received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of OXY stock, raising speculation that he might buy all of the Houston-based oil company.Buffett tends to buy the stock any time it falls to around $60 a share or lower. Occidental’s stock is flat on the year after more than doubling in price during 2022 when global prices for crude oil were elevated.Paramount Global (PARA)girl looking fascinated eating popcorn watching a movie at the local movie theatreSource: Zoriana Zaitseva / Shutterstock.comThis is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s newest positions in the company. As is typical, Warren Buffett has been buying shares of entertainment company Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) in droves. The latest regulatory filings show that Buffett bought 2.4 million shares of PARA stock in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the price slumped. He started purchasing the stock in the first quarter of 2022, and now holds more than 93.5 million shares worth $2 billion.Although Paramount Global’s position makes up less than 1% of Berkshire’s portfolio, the holding company is now the largest shareholder of the entertainment conglomerate. Currently, Berkshire owns a 15.4% ownership stake in the media giant. Today, Paramount Global owns the Paramount Pictures film studio, the CBS television network, and a host of specialty TV channels such as MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central. Additionally, the company is ramping up its Paramount+ and Pluto TV streaming services.PARA stock likely appeals to Buffett as it is relatively cheap at $21 a share and with a price-earnings ratio of 21-times. Plus, the company pays a chunky dividend that yields 4.6%, or quarterly payment to stockholders of 24 cents per share.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in BAC and AAPL.

AMKD is caused by variants of the APOL1 gene and affects approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. Inaxaplin is an APOL1 inhibitor aimed at treating the underlying cause of AMKD.The manuscript presents results from the Phase 2 study of inaxaplin, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction in proteinuria of 47.6% (95% CI: 60.0%, 31.3%) at 13 weeks compared to baseline, which was the primary endpoint of the study. Reduction in proteinuria was observed early and continued throughout the 13-week treatment period. Results were consistent regardless of baseline proteinuria or background standard-of-care therapy. Inaxaplin was generally well tolerated in the study. The most common adverse events (occurring in &gt;15% of subjects) were headache, back pain and nausea. These results provide the first clinical evidence that an oral small molecule APOL1 inhibitor can decrease proteinuria in patients with AMKD.""Inaxaplin has the potential to be a breakthrough for people living with AMKD by addressing the underlying cause of this devastating disease,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. ""We look forward to exploring the full potential of this molecule in the ongoing Phase 2/3 pivotal trial and bringing this potential therapy to patients who are waiting.""""The results from the Phase 2 inaxaplin study show real promise for patients suffering from AMKD,"" said Glenn Chertow, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine and Chair of Vertex’s APOL1 Program Steering Committee. ""APOL1-mediated kidney disease can progress swiftly to kidney failure, and the potential for inaxaplin to precisely target the underlying cause of AMKD should bring hope and excitement to persons living with AMKD and those of us who care for them.""Story continuesAbout InaxaplinEarlier last year, Vertex initiated a pivotal Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the impact of inaxaplin, on top of standard-of-care, on kidney function and proteinuria in people with AMKD. The primary endpoint of the study is reduction in the rate of decline of kidney function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope in patients receiving inaxaplin compared to placebo after a minimum follow-up of approximately two years. The study is also designed to have a pre-planned interim analysis at Week 48 evaluating eGFR slope, supported by a percent change from baseline in proteinuria, in the inaxaplin arm versus placebo. If positive, the interim analysis may serve as the basis for Vertex to seek accelerated approval of VX-147 in the U.S. for patients with AMKD. Enrollment in the study is ongoing, with more than 100 sites open in the U.S. and internationally, with 250 planned sites in total globally.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted inaxaplin Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for APOL1-mediated FSGS. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted inaxaplin Priority Medicines (PRIME) and Orphan Drug designation for AMKD.About APOL1-Mediated Kidney DiseaseAPOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD) is a form of chronic kidney disease caused by variants in the APOL1 gene. Approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe have two APOL1 genetic variants and proteinuric kidney disease. People who inherit two variants in the APOL1 gene have a course of disease that is far more aggressive than in the absence of APOL1 genetic variants. Inherited APOL1 genetic variants cause kidney disease through a toxic gain of function, which leads to podocyte injury. This injury disrupts filtration, resulting in proteinuria and rapidly progressive kidney disease. Progressive kidney disease can result in dialysis, kidney transplant or death.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF.

Griffin was killed while the conductor was seriously injured.A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the train on which Griffin and the conductor were traveling passed a stationary train on an adjacent track, and an angle iron that had been welded to a gondola car hooked to the other train had broken loose. The hanging, broken angle iron pierced the left front-door window of the train in which Griffin was riding.Griffin's widow, Sherita Fields, filed suit in Alabama against Norfolk Southern, along with U.S. Pipe Fabrication LLC and one of U.S. Pipe's employees. According to the lawsuit, Griffin was his family's primary wage earner, and he leaves behind one child who is a minor.NORFOLK SOUTHERN CONDUCTOR DEAD AFTER TRAIN COLLIDES WITH DUMP TRUCK IN CLEVELAND; NTSB INVESTIGATINGNorfolk Southern did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment on the lawsuit, but it said in an earlier statement following Griffin's death that the company was ""grieving the loss of a member of our team"" and ""our hearts go out to his loved ones during this extremely difficult time.""READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPThe lawsuit adds to Norfolk Southern's mounting legal troubles.The rail freight behemoth has been hit with multiple class-action lawsuits from residents in and around East Palestine, Ohio, after a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed on Feb. 3 in the town, causing untold environmental damage.Story continuesMore than 1,000 people were evacuated immediately following the spill, with many reporting health concerns.On Tuesday, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against Norfolk Southern over the East Palestine derailment, looking to hold the railway company responsible for the disaster.NTSB OPENS ‘SPECIAL INVESTIGATION’ INTO NORFOLK SOUTHERNNorfolk Southern president and CEO Alan Shaw has apologized for the derailment and vowed to make things right with the community, pledging that the company — which has set up a family assistance center in East Palestine to help families affected by the disaster — is committed to cleaning up the area affected by the spill.So far, Norfolk Southern has paid out more than $20 million in reimbursements and investments for residents, Shaw told a Senate committee last week, calling the payouts a ""down payment.""In response to Yost's lawsuit, Norfolk Southern issued a statement that addressed several of the concerns in his complaint and noted that company officials had met with the attorney general this week ""to discuss three additional programs we plan to develop in conjunction with his office and other community leaders and stakeholders.""In the statement, Norfolk Southern committed to setting up a long-term medical compensation fund for East Palestine residents, making investments to bolster the local economy and ""provide tailored protection for home sellers if their property loses value due to the impact of the derailment"" and take action to protect the area's drinking water over the long term.]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has gained 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. This estimate has changed +1.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.79 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.85 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $44.82 billion and $47.07 billion estimates indicate +4.2% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.13 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To encourage anyone in this situation, it’s never too late to start planning ahead. And certainly, it’s better to do something now than not do anything at all. Further, with medical advancements and innovations in the broader health and wellness space, it’s quite possible that what we consider the 30s today may actually be the equivalent of the 20s. In addition, the wider changes in the global economy pinpoint certain market ideas that may stand the test of time.So, if you’re interested in building a robust retirement, these are compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors.WMWaste Management$149.33IBMIBM.$125.45RIORio Tinto$78.59CVXChevron$159.67CAGConagra$35.01PFEPfizer$39.39NEENextEra Energy$73.01InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWaste Management (WM)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin.

And of course, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) makes for an intriguing idea because somebody has to deal with all the waste products that individuals and corporate entities create. In other words, WM most likely represents a permanently relevant market idea.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Waste Management is modestly undervalued. Objectively, though, the company’s greatest strengths center on its operational attributes. For example, WM’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 9.5%, outpacing 60% of sector peers. In terms of profitability, the enterprise features a net margin of 11.36%, above 74.19% of the industry. Also, it’s worth noting that the firm’s return on equity (ROE) is 31.68%, dominating the sector. It also signifies an extremely high-quality business. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg WM as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $165.60, implying 10% upside potential.Story continuesIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVTo be frank, legacy technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn’t offer the most exciting investment. However, as one of the compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors, it more than holds its own. In recent years, management made a concerted effort to lean off less-relevant endeavors for contemporary solutions such as cloud computing. As well, it’s made forays into genuinely exciting sectors such as blockchain and machine learning.While IBM’s financials could use some shoring up, at the moment, it makes for an enticing market idea. For example, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 13.2. As a discount to earnings, “Big Blue” ranks better than 80.62% of the competition. In addition, the company benefits from an ROE of 8.25%, outpacing 62.68% of its peers. Also, it’s well worth mentioning that IBM carries a forward yield of 5.23%. Plus, it features 29 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg IBM as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $143.56, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Rio Tinto (RIO)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comOver the next few decades, it’s quite possible that auto manufacturers may make conspicuous inroads into the electrification of mobility. However, what’s not so clear is which brand will end up dominating the electric vehicle market. Sure, everyone wants to say the T-word. However, no one has a lock on what might happen 20 to 30 years down the road. But that’s the beauty behind Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).If you’re looking for investment opportunities for beginning investors, RIO deserves more than a second look. As a metal and mining stalwart, Rio Tinto specializes in several key commodities. However, for EVs, their lithium and copper units should perform very well. Throw in some geopolitical tensions and competition and RIO can truly fly. Not only that, RIO offers an undervalued opportunity. Presently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 9.09. As a discount to earnings, Rio ranks better than 62.35% of the mining industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg RIO as a consensus hold. Still, their average price target hits $79.27, implying over 16% upside potential.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAs one of the world’s top hydrocarbon specialists, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) does not initially appear as a viable candidate for investment opportunities for beginning investors. After all, I just got done talking about EVs and their implications for the future of transportation. However, it’s also wise to hedge against this grandiose wager. Frankly, it’s not guaranteed that EVs will take over. For one thing, EVs remain expensive for the average-income household. Yes, economies of scale may address this conundrum. But it’s also possible that the cost profile might not shrink fast enough. Second, EVs may remain inconvenient regarding quick-charging capabilities unless some radical invention materializes.For those that don’t believe in the electrification narrative, Chevron offers an operationally robust and profitable enterprise. Also, the company carries a forward yield of 3.76% with a relatively low payout ratio of 41.4%. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target pings at $189.69, implying over 18% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhile no guarantees exist in the capital markets, over time, it’s almost a sure thing that Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) will be a relevant enterprise for many years to come. A consumer-packaged goods holding company, Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names. These products find themselves in supermarkets, restaurants, and food-service establishments.Put another way, no matter what happens in future economic cycles, people got to eat. This obvious framework should keep the lights on at Conagra. Even better, the market prices CAG at a forward multiple of 12.34. As a discount to earnings, the food giant ranks better than 67.87% of sector peers. Regarding passive income, Conagra carries a forward yield of 3.76%. As well, the payout ratio sits at 47%, symbolizing confidence in yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CAG as a moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $41.70, implying nearly 19% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the compelling investment opportunities for beginning investors.Pfizer (PFE)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comA world-renowned pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) makes for an intriguing candidate for investment opportunities for beginning investors. Naturally, during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, Pfizer gained considerable attention for forwarding a vaccine. However, with Covid-19 fears fading into the background, PFE lost its relevance. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled by 23%.Here’s the thing – Pfizer never lost its scientific relevance. In addition, with its acumen in messenger-RNA-based vaccines, it could potentially forward other significant medical advancements. It’s not just an upside catalyst for the Covid crisis. Indeed, the market prices PFE at a forward multiple of 11.5. In contrast, the sector median value pings at 16.65. Beyond that, Pfizer carries an attractive forward yield of 4.16%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PFE as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $49.67, implying nearly 26% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockProbably one of the most obvious ideas for investment opportunities for beginning investors, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a renewable energy stalwart. While the broader political ecosystem has been gradually pushing toward renewables, the military conflict in eastern Europe accelerated this initiative. With Russia’s hydrocarbon supplies largely offline for western nations, they will need to find workable solutions.Over time, many climate advocates hope for a completely green energy infrastructure. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure we’ll get there. However, in the meantime, plenty of politically motivated funds will move into this space. Therefore, NEE should be one of the intriguing investment opportunities for beginning investors. Financially, NextEra’s greatest strength arguably lies in its profitability metrics. For instance, the company’s net margin pings at 19.79%, outpacing 85% of the competition. Lastly, covering analysts peg NEE as a consensus (and unanimous) strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $94.55, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The companies teamed up last year to introduce MA’s personal payments service platform - Mastercard Send across Italy.After extending the multiple benefits of the platform in Europe, Mastercard has decided to further expand its platform’s reach to the Asia Pacific region. Some of the countries in the region that will reap the benefits of Mastercard Send, by virtue of the expanded collaboration, include Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong SAR. While customers of Checkout.com in Singapore can already avail the Send service, the same is expected to roll out in Australia and Hong Kong SAR in later 2023.The Mastercard Send platform remains the preferred choice for merchants and acquirers owing to the numerous tailwinds that it offers. Instant payout capabilities for fintechs, banks and insurance companies or easing wages payment by gig platforms are some of the benefits of the platform. It also extends a helping hand to merchants and online marketplaces while processing refunds or settlements or to governments for giving tax rebates and subsidies.A booming digital economy and promising growth opportunities for acquirers in the Asia Pacific region might have promoted Mastercard to unveil Mastercard Send across the region. With the Mastercard Send platform, MA remains well-poised to relieve consumers from challenges inflicted by the use of age-old traditional payment methods that continue to be in use across the globe. Such methods cause delays, are time-consuming and pose threat with regard to the safety of payments.Mastercard leverages the platform to work closely with digital messaging and payment platforms thus empowering consumers of around 50 markets to use an app for seamless and immediate transfer of funds to other consumers in over 100 markets. Also, issuers have witnessed utilization of the Send Service, which leads to speedy payments, leading to higher average monthly debit card spending. This clearly demonstrates the potential exhibited by the MA platform.Story continuesSuch platforms are built leveraging the multi-rail payment capabilities of Mastercard and aim to offer increased speed, choice and convenience while simultaneously assuring the safety and control of transactions as well. Apart from Mastercard Send, it also has a cross-border platform in place that facilitates easy transfer of funds. Mastercard Cross-Border Services is frequently chosen by various financial institutions from all over the world to bring about simplified cross-border payments. The platform remains lucrative as it boasts a strongly interconnected banking network and is backed by more than five-decade expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments.Shares of Mastercard have gained 2.3% in a year against the industry’s 5.6% decline.

KMT is benefiting from innovation capabilities, solid product offerings, commercial and operational excellence and a wide geographical presence. In addition, the company’s diversified customer base in various end markets enables it to avoid customer concentration risks. It expects sales of $520-$530 million, driven by continued growth in energy, aerospace, general engineering and earthworks in third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ending March 2023). The midpoint of the guided range of $525 million implies a 2.5% jump from the fiscal third-quarter 2022 figure of $512 million.Kennametal’s Metal Cutting segment is benefiting from strength in its general engineering, transportation, aerospace and energy end markets. Also, its strong pricing actions along with improvements in customer service and labor and material productivity bode well.

This has outpaced the Conglomerates sector's loss of 2.33% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.06% in that time.General Electric will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, General Electric is projected to report earnings of $0.12 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 50%.

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

361,253bc570-7e13-4b26-b840-3eb4ac8fb9eb,GE,2023-03-16,Jack Welch's GE legacy ended last week: R.I.P.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-welchs-ge-legacy-ended-last-week-rip-134345986.html,1678887825,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Jack Welch, the legendary long-time chief executive of General Electric, died on Mar. 1, 2020, almost two decades after he left the company. His corporate legacy died at GE’s recent Investor Day event: Mar. 9, 2023.And thereby lies a tale. Actually, two tales.The first is about how Welch, who many people considered a management genius, ended up leaving a mess behind when he retired from GE (GE), which is now being dismantled in a total reversal of Welch’s heritage.The second is about how buying stock in a company because you think the CEO is a genius—and will appoint a genius to succeed him—can be dangerous to your financial health.For those of you who aren’t familiar with Welch, who at 45 became GE’s youngest-ever CEO in 1981 and retired in 2001, much of corporate America and the business press came to consider him a financial god with a divine touch.During his tenure, GE’s stock outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (^GSPC) index, Wall Street’s favorite comparative-performance metric, by an astounding 8-to-1 margin. GE rose 5,600% from $2.38 the day before Welch took over to $135.69 the day he left, compared with a 700% rise in the S&amp;P.(All the numbers in the story, from Yahoo Finance, don’t include dividends, and are adjusted for GE’s 1-for-8 reverse stock in 2021 and this year’s spinoff of GE HealthCare.)Welch was widely worshipped. Among his other honors, Fortune magazine named him Manager of the Century in 1999, and in 2000, the Financial Times named GE “The World’s Most Respected Company” for the third straight year.People wrote books about Welch’s management skills and what a genius he was. During his 20-year run, GE made hundreds of acquisitions and became a gigantic enterprise that for parts of his tenure had the highest stock market value of any U.S. company.However, after Welch retired, it became clear that he'd been playing earnings and accounting games, and loading up on financial assets, which allowed far more flexibility in reporting gains and losses than GE’s old-line manufacturing businesses did.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Welch’s successors—Jeff Immelt for 16 years and John Flannery for 14 months—couldn’t keep the game going the way Welch did. Welch, who talked a lot about how important it was for a CEO to appoint a terrific successor, sponsored a public competition among Immelt and two other GE executives, both of whom left the company after Welch appointed Immelt.But because Immelt had inherited all sorts of problems and made a number of mistakes, his tenure was no triumph for GE investors—or for Welch as it turned out. Under Immelt, GE stock rose 6.5%, but the S&amp;P more than doubled, up 128% during his tenure. Under Flannery, the stock fell 51% while the S&amp;P rose 18%.The stock went from being a can’t-lose under Welch to a can’t-win under his successors.Which is why, in 2018, GE’s board named Larry Culp CEO to try to clean up the mess. Culp, a member of GE’s board who became the first GE CEO who hadn’t previously been an employee, had an outsider’s view of the company and saw how fouled up the company was. Culp, previously the highly-successful CEO of Danaher Corp. (DHR), began selling off pieces of GE. At the recent Investor Day meeting, Culp said that he’d cut GE’s debt by $100 billion.How times change. I watched virtually the whole four-hour Investor Day presentation and didn’t hear Jack Welch’s name mentioned even once.Culp spun off what’s now called GE HealthCare (GEHC) in January, will spin off GE’s energy business next year into what will become GE Vernova, and will stay as CEO of the remaining company, which will be called GE Aerospace.""Neutron Jack"": Former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, speaks during the World Business Forum in New York in 2010. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonWall Street loves Culp’s breakup plan. And when various GE executives exuded optimism at Investor Day, GE stock rose 5% or so. Through Monday, GE stock had risen 25% during Culp’s tenure, compared with 32% for the S&amp;P.Those aren’t Welch-like statistics—Welch’s outperformance of the S&amp;P will likely never be matched—but they’re a lot better than Flannery and Immelt did.However, although Welch’s GE legacy has been terminated, his influence on much of corporate America continues. Welch had GE adopt what’s known as “rank and yank,” firing the bottom-ranked 10% of GE’s managers every year and lavishly awarding top performers. He sliced tens of thousands of employees from GE’s payroll and became known as Neutron Jack—a name he hated—because he vaporized jobs but left the buildings standing.These days you see evidence of Welch’s fingerprints all over big-time corporate America. Many companies, for instance, report “adjusted earnings”—meaning earnings as they define them rather than as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles define them.And companies issue what’s called “earnings guidance,” often keeping the number on the low side so that profits will “exceed expectations,” as they say on Wall Street. When things get a bit tight, many companies will cut back on capital expenditures and play legal but misleading accounting games to beat the earnings numbers they’d promised Wall Street. And, of course, employees frequently become human sacrifices.That to me is the real GE story. And Welch’s real legacy.-Disclosures: I have a small GE holding, which I bought after Culp became its CEO because I have a substantial investment in Danaher, which prospered under Culp’s leadership. I also have small investments in GE and GE Heathcare, and I gave each of my four grandkids a share of GE as a year-end present.Allan Sloan, who has written about business for more than 50 years, is a seven-time winner of the Gerald Loeb Award, business journalism’s highest honor.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Valero Energy, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$16b ÷ (US$61b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 36%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Oil and Gas industry average of 21%. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Valero Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Valero Energy.So How Is Valero Energy's ROCE Trending?Valero Energy's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 294% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Bottom Line On Valero Energy's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Valero Energy has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 67% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Valero Energy can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Valero Energy   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The company’s refineries are located across the United States, Canada and the U.K. Valero, which has ownership interests in 15 petroleum refineries, has a combined throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day.Valero boasts that its premium refining operations are resilient even when the business operating environment is carbon-constrained. Its refining business has the capabilities to generate handsome cashflows, which would allow it to return capital to shareholders and back growth projects.Valero’s renewable diesel segment involves the Diamond Green Diesel (“DGD”) joint venture, which is a leading renewable fuel producer in North America. The joint venture is between Darling Ingredients Inc. and Valero. Low-carbon fuel policies across the globe are primarily aiding the demand for renewable diesel, driving Valero’s Renewable Diesel business.With the commissioning of the DGD Port Arthur facility in the fourth quarter of 2022, DGD’s combined renewable diesel production capacity increased by 470 million gallons per year to approximately 1.2 billion gallons per year. In 2023, Valero’s renewable diesel margins are expected to remain consistent with the current levels.In 2022, Valero’s total throughput volumes increased to 2,953 thousand barrels per day from 2,787 thousand barrels per day. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located in the Gulf coast area from where there is easy access to the export facilities. This Gulf coast presence helped Valero expand its export volumes over the last few years and gain from high distillate margins.Valero’s commitment to the energy transition is commendable. The company is on track to reduce and displace Refinery GHG emissions by 63% through investments in board-approved projects by 2025. Hence, Valero is actively investing in low-carbon businesses such as biofuels, renewable diesel and wind power generation.Story continuesOther Key PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Antero Midstream Corporation AM reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. The strong quarterly results were primarily driven by higher freshwater delivery volumes and increased average freshwater distribution fees.For 2023, Antero Midstream expects a net income of $340-$380 million, indicating an increase from $326.2 million reported in 2022.Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s MPC adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54. The bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and another $700 million worth of shares from the start of this year to Jan 27. Marathon Petroleum, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $7.6 billion.Murphy USA Inc.’s MUSA fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $5.21 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.16. The underperformance can be attributed to lower-than-expected petroleum product sales.Murphy USA projects a 2023 fuel volume of 240-245 thousand gallons on an APSM basis. Further, Murphy USA’s 2023 guidance includes up to 45 new stores, up to 30 raze-and-rebuilds, and $795-$815 million in merchandise margin contribution.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.MPC is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.27. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's industry has an average PEG of 0.56 right now. Within the past year, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.32.We should also highlight that MPC has a P/B ratio of 1.70. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.82. Over the past year, MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.21, with a median of 1.59.Finally, our model also underscores that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.26. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. MPC's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.15. Within the past 12 months, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 3.70.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Valero Energy (VLO). VLO is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Valero Energy is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 5.62 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.94. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 5.64 and average PEG ratio of 0.56.Over the past year, VLO's P/E has been as high as 12.62, as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.39; its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.10, as low as 0.73, with a median of 0.32 during the same time period.Additionally, Valero Energy has a P/B ratio of 1.87 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.82. For VLO, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.70, with a median of 2.01 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that MPC and VLO is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

366,313a0ec3-6e1f-340d-b142-004aa84fce91,VLO,2023-03-16,Exxon’s Texas Plant Is Likely the Last Major US Refinery Project,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-texas-plant-likely-last-130003239.html,1678885203,STORY,"['XOM', 'VLO']","[(Bloomberg) -- When Exxon Mobil Corp.’s newest addition to its southeast Texas refinery ramps up to full production in the next few weeks, it’ll be the first major expansion of US fuel-making capacity in at least a decade. And probably the last.Most Read from BloombergCredit Suisse Reels After Top Shareholder Rules Out Raising StakeRyan Reynolds-Backed Mint Is Bought by T-Mobile for $1.35 BillionStocks See Some Relief After Bank-Driven Selloff: Markets WrapBofA Gets More Than $15 Billion in Deposits After SVB FailsSignature Bank Faced Criminal Probe Ahead of Firm’s CollapseFor Exxon, the timing has worked impeccably: It’s expanding supplies of diesel and a gasoline ingredient called vacuum gasoil, or VGO, just as customers are struggling to replace sanctioned Russian cargoes.In addition, the refinery expansion in the small industrial city of Beaumont, about a 90-minute drive from Houston, gives Exxon a guaranteed outlet for oil produced in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. Using domestic crude nets Exxon more than $40 for every barrel of diesel produced, a historically eye-popping margin.Exxon’s feat is unlikely to be replicated, given the industry-wide push to reduce carbon footprints and concurrent refinery construction across Africa, the Middle East and Asia that’ll swell global oil-processing capacity. In the US, gasoline consumption already has peaked, reducing any incentive for refiners to spend billions expanding output.Even as US rivals like Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. put the finishing touches on expansions at their own Texas refineries, they pale in comparison to Exxon’s mammoth 250,000-barrel increase in daily capacity that will make the Beaumont complex second in size to Saudi Aramco’s enormous plant in nearby Port Arthur.“We’re pretty bullish on this project,” John Auers, managing director of RBN Energy’s Refined Fuels Analytics, said of Exxon’s expansion. “Theirs is likely the last major expansion in the US. They’re the last guys in.”Story continuesWhen Exxon launched the $2 billion Beaumont expansion project five years ago, the global refining industry was on the precipice of a dramatic slump that would see almost 4 million barrels of daily fuel-making capacity mothballed as the pandemic gutted energy demand and tougher environmental rules made the oldest, dirtiest plants unprofitable to operate.Read More: Peak Gasoline Will Bring US Price Shocks and Inflation HeadachesBut for Exxon, the mathematics of what a bigger Beaumont would mean for its bottom line were compelling. Despite what was transpiring in the wider world of refining, Exxon’s Permian crude was so cheap to produce and inexpensive to haul to the plant that the investment was justified, said Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.Exxon “justified that project purely on logistics optimizations and lower-cost transportation to feed that refinery” Woods told analysts during a Jan. 31 conference call. “We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom.”The refinery’s daily capacity will increase almost 70% to about 619,000 barrels, becoming almost as large as the Saudis’ 626,000-barrel complex in neighboring Port Arthur.In contrast, Exxon’s smaller rivals are engaged in less ambitious projects. Marathon Petroleum is close to completing an expansion of its Galveston Bay refinery that will add 40,000 barrels of daily crude capacity. Meanwhile, Valero is scheduled to add 100,000 barrels of daily capacity to its Port Arthur complex.Exxon’s advantage over both of those peers is that it has its own source of crude. Because they don’t possess wells, pure-play refiners such as Marathon Petroleum and Valero are more exposed to oil-market gyrations.Exxon’s expansion also creates a new source of vacuum gasoil, or VGO, which is in high demand among US refiners cut off from Russian production that was their single largest foreign source of the component prior to the war in Ukraine.“When Exxon conceived the expansion, I’m sure it was about feedstock,” said Amrita Sen, co-founder and director of research at London consultancy Energy Aspects. “Now it’s more about refinery shortages.”To be sure, there are major refinery expansions underway outside the US. A slate of new Middle East projects are in various stages of coming online, according to Sen.So-called refinery runs are seen rising by 1.7 million barrels this year compared with 2022, according to Energy Aspects, with most of it concentrated in the second half and dedicated to a class of fuels called middle distillates that includes diesel. In the US, the expansion trend may be offset somewhat by LyondellBasell Industries NV’s planned closure of a Houston complex as well as the conversion of two California refineries to renewable-diesel production.Exxon’s new firepower comes as domestic stockpiles of diesel and similar fuels are 10% below the 10-year average for this time of year. The shortfall is even more acute along the East Coast, where the deficit is 16%.Unpredictable MarketsThe Beaumont plant in the state’s far southeast tip close to the Louisiana border sits at the nexus of fuel production and demand: The Colonial Pipeline can haul the region’s fuel to East Coast markets while nearby Gulf Coast ports can load it onto tankers bound for international destinations.For his part, CEO Woods doesn’t pretend the expansion was undertaken with an eye to capturing profits from an upward cycle no one else saw coming.“We can’t call the cycles,” Woods said during the late-January conference call. “We can’t predict where the markets will go and over what time frame, but we can control the cost of the barrels that we’re bringing on.”--With assistance from Kevin Crowley.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNaples, Florida, Sees a Rush of New Money—But City Workers Are Getting Priced OutThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile Economy72 Hours in Washington: How the Frenzied SVB Rescue Took ShapeDrugs in Orbit: One Startup’s Big Idea for MicrogravityFree IRS TurboTax Competitor Is Closer After Biden Funding©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.7%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.87%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.77%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the beauty products company had lost 5.91% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 1.52% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.06% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Estee Lauder as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Estee Lauder to post earnings of $0.49 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 74.21%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.71 billion, down 12.56% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.96 per share and revenue of $16.93 billion. These totals would mark changes of -31.49% and -4.55%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Estee Lauder should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Estee Lauder is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Estee Lauder has a Forward P/E ratio of 48.46 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 33.63, so we one might conclude that Estee Lauder is trading at a premium comparatively.Investors should also note that EL has a PEG ratio of 5.28 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Cosmetics industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.06 as of yesterday's close.The Cosmetics industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 183, which puts it in the bottom 28% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Airline players like United Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group are likely to benefit from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Moreover, the labor crunch that is currently being faced by the airline industry is another woe.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry  houses players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers.Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy.For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air-travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is another positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryBuoyant Air Traffic: The stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge positive for the industry, which was one of the worst-hit industries in the peak COVID-19 period. People are again resorting to air travel with the resumption of normal activities. The removal of COVID-related restrictions is aiding air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well.Story continuesRecently, the United States ended COVID testing requirements for passengers from China. The restrictions had been in effect since Jan 5, following the renewed outbreak in China. This rosy scenario with respect to air traffic is likely to stay as is evident from the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) expectation of airlines returning to profitability in 2023.Focus on Cargo Revenues Bodes Well: The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues bodes well for top-line growth, especially in the current scenario where passenger revenues are rebounding strongly from the pandemic lows. Highlighting the focus on cargo revenues, United Airlines' revenues from cargo improved 49.4% in fourth-quarter 2022 from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals to $472 million. Per IATA's forecast, cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which though lower than the 2022 levels are still $48.6 billion higher than the 2019 actuals.High Costs: Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to high fuel and labor costs. The spike in fuel costs (oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period) is not a welcome development as expenses on fuel represent a major input cost for airlines. Moreover, with U.S. airlines grappling with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked recently in the space. This will result in an increase in labor costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 29-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #42, which places it in the top 17% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up 13.5% since September 2022.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 3.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 10.9% and the broader sector's decrease of 10.3%.The Valuation PictureThe price/sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.40X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.35X. It is also below the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.57X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.02X, as low as 0.33X and at the median of 0.67X.3 Transportation - Airline Stocks to BuyAll three stocks discussed below presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).United Airlines has a market capitalization of $15.97 billion and is presently based in Chicago. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding UAL. However, high fuel costs are affecting its bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL's 2023 earnings has been revised 22.1% upward. United Airlines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters (missing twice), the average beat being 5.42%.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereAmerican Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX and has a market capitalization of $9.67 billion, presently.

The motion seeks a speedy review of the California Public Utilities Commission’s recent decision concerning the Pure Water Monterey Expansion (PWMe) water purchase agreement. California American Water’s response supports the PAO’s request.The PAO’s motion, if adopted in a rehearing decision, would correct two of the most problematic aspects of the original decision. It would secure funding for two new extraction wells vital to delivering water from the PWMe to customers on the Monterey Peninsula. Also, the decision, as modified, would partially address legal errors related to how infrastructure funding is accounted for during the construction period. California American Water’s response affirms that the company would move forward with the PWMe water purchase agreement if the PAO’s changes are adopted in a rehearing decision. While the motion doesn’t address all of the legal and factual errors of the original decision, California American Water supports PWMe as a critical component of the future water supply portfolio for its Monterey Peninsula customers and urges the CPUC to move forward expeditiously.""California American Water is committed to moving forward with the Pure Water Monterey Expansion agreement with the corrections the PAO has proposed. We encourage the CPUC to grant a rapid rehearing and address the errors in the original decision,"" said Kevin Tilden, president of California American Water. ""California American Water has built new infrastructure and advanced funding to our partner agency supporting the expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project. We want to quickly resolve the key issues with the CPUC decision and move forward with the new supplies to protect the Carmel River.""Story continuesIn its PWMe decision (D.22-12-001), the Commission delayed recovery of infrastructure investments made by the company to support the project, changed capital structures for project development and contradicted CPUC precedent and practice. The decision as written would have substantial negative impacts on the company, its customers and the region. California American Water has requested the CPUC review the decision to correct clear legal and factual errors and allow the company to move forward with the project water purchase agreement.In November 2021, California American Water, Monterey One Water and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District all signed a Memorandum of Understanding to proceed with a purchase agreement for water provided by Monterey One Water Expansion if the CPUC approved recovery of infrastructure costs advanced by California American Water. The company remains committed to the terms of the memorandum.Together, the recently approved desalination plant and the Pure Water Monterey Expansion will allow the community to replace water no longer available from the Carmel River and comply with the orders of the State Water Resources Control Board.About California American Water:California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 700,000 people.

The deal was closed after it received approval from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) in February 2023.Benefits of the BuyoutSince September 2022, Washington Water has been serving Bethel Greenacres customers through an operation and maintenance agreement. The Bethel Greenacres system includes 200 residential customer connections, adjacent to Washington Water’s East Pierce system.The acquisition of Bethel’s water system assets would give Washington Water access to these 200 connections, which would increase CWT’s customer count. Such improvements can be expected to boost the company’s revenues in the future.The acquisition is also expected to bolster CWT’s strategic investment plans to support the provision of safe, reliable water service for both routine and emergency needs.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionPer the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently in service.Per the ASCE finding, 6 billion gallons of treated water go waste every day in the United States due to a delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance. Essential upgrades and infrastructure repairs get delayed at times, owing to lack of adequate funds and a large number of small operators in the industry.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities is the need of the hour, as it ensures necessary investments for infrastructure upgrade and continuation of high-quality services to customers. The reason behind CWT’s aforementioned acquisition appears to be the same.Water Utilities Continue to ConsolidateCalifornia Water Service has been expanding operations through strategic acquisitions to offer infrastructural upgrades and reliable services to customers. The latest acquisition is a testament to the same.In November 2022, Washington Water Service acquired Driftwood Valley Association’s water system assets. This is expected to add 62 customers to CWT’s database. Also, in October 2022, Washington Water received approval to acquire Stroh’s Water Company’s assets, which will add another 900 customers on closing by the first quarter of 2023.Other water utilities like American Water Works AWK, Consolidated Water Co. CWCO and Essential Utilities WTRG are also expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.American Water Works continues to expand operations through acquisitions and organic means. In 2022, AWK added 70,000 customers through 26 closed acquisitions in seven states. AWK’s 21 pending acquisitions (as of Dec 31), when completed, will add another 32,400 customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWK's 2023 earnings implies a 5.8% increase year over year. Its current dividend yield is 1.9%.In January 2023, Consolidated Water acquired the remaining 39% of PERC Water Corporation's equity ownership for $7.8 million. PERC’s strong operating performance, revenue growth and profitability, as well as its synergies with other areas of CWCO’s business and future growth prospects, are expected to boost CWCO’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings implies a 143.5% increase year over year. The company’s current dividend yield is 2.3%.In 2022, Essential Utilities acquired three water and wastewater systems, which expanded its customer base by 23,000. Recently, Essential Utilities signed eight purchase agreements to acquire nine additional water and wastewater systems for $380 million. These systems are expected to serve 219,000 retail customers or equivalent dwelling units.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG's 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 5.7%.

According to a report by Deloitte, a US recession will take down Canadian economic growth for three consecutive quarters, with an expected overall contraction of 0.9%. However, this recession will be relatively mild in comparison with the previous market downturns, the professional services company noted. This current stock market’s condition has called for investment in dividend equities because they can generate stable income for investors.According to a report by RBC Global Asset Management, dividends have represented 30% of the total return from the Canadian equity market. The report also mentioned that dividends accounted for 39% of the market’s total return over the last 10 years. In the current environment, it is imperative to gauge the performance of dividend stocks relative to inflation. The report by the same capital market company highlighted that the S&amp;P/TSX Dividends delivered an annual average return of 7.9% in the last 20 years, widely outpacing inflation which returned at an annual average rate of 2.2%.Overall, dividend stocks in Canada have shown a strong performance in comparison to their peers. Especially companies that have raised their dividends for a significant period remained big winners. Another report published by RBC revealed that dividend growers delivered a compound annual return of 10.8% from 1986 to 2022, compared with a 9.1% return from the dividend-payers. During this period, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index returned 6.2%, falling behind dividend growers by a wide margin. The report has additionally mentioned that dividend growers have displayed less volatility of 13.3% during this period, compared with a 23.4% volatility of non-dividend stocks.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 8.4% loss over the past four weeks.The uptick followed the approval by the Surface Transportation Board, the economic regulator that oversees freight railroads, of the deal of Canadian Pacific to takeover Kansas City Southern. The approval paves the way for the creation of the first freight rail network linking Canada, the United States and Mexico. The approval, following the conclusion of the two-year review process, implies that the first major railroad merger has been cleared by regulators in the United States in more than two decades.This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%. Revenues are expected to be $2 billion, up 37.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Canadian Pacific, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on CP going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -18.7%). The company is facing the heat due to the escalation in fuel costs, as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front.In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+14.0% vs. +7.8%). The company is benefitting from solid global brand recognition supporting which management focuses on increasing global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, and remodeling existing stores.North America comps continue to impress investors. The company also aids from successful menu innovations and digital initiatives along with its exceptional loyalty programs.However, its performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market.

The company’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk due to higher technological resource prices. A comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Sales ratio shows a gloomy picture that may concern investors.Nevertheless, Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider which focuses on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities by investing heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects. During the 2023-2027 period, the company plans capital investments of $65 billion. It also plans to expand in the electric vehicle segment.(You can read the full research report on Duke Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Eni S.p.A.

AMP, Everest Re Group Ltd.'s RE, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP, Henry Schein Inc. HSIC and HSBC Holdings plc HSBC.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Fed May Stock to 25bps Rate Hike After SVB Fiasco: 5 PicksWall Street tumbled last week following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank — the biggest bank failure since the days of the great recession of 2008. Market participants remained highly concerned that the ripple effect of the bank's failure may shake the broad market. However, a sliver lining in the SVB disaster is that the Fed may be compelled to stick to a 25 basis points hike in interest rate in its March FOMC meeting.A Hawkish FedThe Fed hiked the benchmark interest by a staggering 4.25% in 2022 to combat 40-year high inflation. The inflation rate reached its peak at 9.1% in June 2022 and thereafter declined to 6 — 6.5% in December, though it stayed significantly higher than the central bank's 2% target rate.A steady decline in the inflation rate in the last three months of 2022 enabled the Fed to reduce the magnitude of rate hike to 25 basis points. However, a sudden spike in inflation in January and a series of strong economic data changed the whole scenario.On Mar 7 and 8, in his testimony to the U.S. Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that interest rates are likely to head higher than what central bank policymakers had anticipated. In the December FOMC meeting, Fed officials had estimated the terminal interest rate to be at 5.1% for this rate hike cycle.However, after Powell's testimony, the CME FedWatch showed that market participants expect the terminal interest rate to be within the 5.5% to 5.75% range. Moreover, the CME FedWatch showed a 73.5% probability that the Fed would hike the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in the March FOMC meeting while the probability of a 25 basis-points hike is just 26.5%. These situations were almost reversed just before the release of Powell's testimony.Story continuesGovernment Assures SVB Depositors About Their MoneyMarket participants' expectations regarding rate hike have changed significantly after last week's SVB debacle. The bank is the first major casualty of the Fed's aggressive rate hike. A large section of economists and financial experts have warned that the Federal Government should immediately find a buyer for SVB or else the ripple effect of the bank's failure will shake the broad market.Investors are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. Clients of SVB's startup companies, especially from the technology sector, will find it hard to run their business. Venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital. This has forced the U.S. government to assure all SVB depositors about their money.Moreover, the Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls came in at 311,000 in February, beating the consensus estimate of 227,000. However, the number declined significantly from January's data of 504,000.The unemployment rate increased to 3.6% in February from 3.4% in January. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% in February compared with a 0.3% rise in January. Year over year, hourly wage rate rose 4.6% in February, below the consensus estimate of 4.8%.Consequently, the CME FedWatch is now showing an overwhelming 70.9% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the March FOMC meeting. Importantly, 29.1% respondents expect the central bank to keep the interest rate static at the current range of 4.5 to 4.75%. No respondent expects a more than 25 basis point rate hike.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have applied our VGM Style Score to narrow the search to select five companies that have strong earnings growth potential for 2023.

389,074670e7-8dcd-3f5f-8566-a9a044edf607,CSCO,2023-03-16,Companies say they want diversity. So why are Latinos left off corporate boards?,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-diversifying-corporate-boards-latinos-120047085.html,1678881647,STORY,['CSCO'],"[ (Ludi Leiva / For The Times)Cisco Systems, the multinational tech giant based in San Jose, has no Latino on its board of directors.Ditto for Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif.Ditto for Tesla — which moved offices to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto last year — and for a host of other Fortune 100 companies with millions of Latino customers, employees and suppliers. Among them: Amazon, FedEx, Albertsons, Kroger, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Exxon Mobil, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, United Parcel Service and Berkshire Hathaway.Latinos are the nation’s largest ethnic or racial minority — accounting for 18.9% of the population — and its fastest-growing group. In California, 40% of residents trace their roots to Mexico or Central or South America.Yet even as companies tout their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Latinos are far less likely to ascend to the pinnacle of business power in mostly white boardrooms than Black Americans, who account for 13.6% of the U.S. population, or Asian Americans at 6.1%.“We remain a blind spot for corporate America,” said Esther Aguilera, chief executive of the Latino Corporate Directors Assn., an advocacy group founded in 2013. “The narrative has been, ‘We can’t find qualified Latinos.’ But there’s ample talent.""Across a huge screen at a recent San Diego business conference, before 6,300 executives and professionals, Aguilera splashed the names of 47 of the nation’s Fortune 100 corporations with no Latino directors.Beyond the naming and shaming, she contrasted Latinos with other people of color. A slide showed what she called “the stark reality” of S&amp;P 500 boards: Black directors at 11%, Asian directors at 6% and Latino directors at 5% in 2022.Companies, she said later, promote people based on “perceptions of who’s worthy … and Latinos are at the bottom of the barrel. Yet Latino talent is right under their nose.”The issue of who benefits from inclusion initiatives — and who doesn’t — is at the heart of affirmative action debates across the nation. California ballot initiatives have outlawed preferences in public university admissions and government contracting. A high-profile case before the U.S. Supreme Court argues that Asian students lose out when colleges favor Black and Latino applicants.Story continues“We don’t want anybody to be under-engaged, whether they’re African American or Asian American or Anglo American. But we do want to see Latino and Latina Americans at par,” said Solomon Trujillo, a former chief executive of telecommunications firm U.S. West who joined Western Union’s board in 2012.“When you hear CEOs and everybody talk about ‘I believe in diversity and inclusion,’ I say show me the numbers.”Solomon Trujillo, right, talks with Kevin Reilly of Warner Media at the 2019 L'Attitude conference in San Diego. (Alexandra Mendoza / San Diego Union-Tribune)Trujillo co-founded the Latino Donor Collaborative, a Beverly Hills nonprofit that publishes an annual Latino GDP report. Its latest research, by scholars at UCLA and California Lutheran University, pegs the economic impact of the nation’s 62 million Latino consumers at $2.8 trillion in 2020. And in 2018, he co-founded L'Attitude, the conference where Aguilera shared her findings, as a way to showcase Latino contributions.Trujillo condemns the dearth of Latino board members, given the size of the Latino market and the importance of cultural knowledge. Companies without Latino directors risk “leaving money on the table,” he said.From the dais at L’Attitude, he asked attendees: “How many of you use an Exxon station to refuel? Guess who are the most people on the road, commuting to work every day? It tends to be Latinos in many of the major markets in our country. So you have to ask, why don't they want a Latino or Latina on their board?”An Exxon Mobil spokesperson declined to comment on the lack of Latinos on the company’s 13-member board, which has two Black directors, but said the board “believes diversity of thought, experience, and background is critical for successful governance.”Cisco and Intel spokespeople said their leaders value diversity but declined to elaborate on why their boards, which include Black and Asian directors, have no Latinos. Other Fortune 100 companies called out for lacking Latino directors offered statements of support for diversity without addressing the composition of their own boards.Bold tactics, mixed resultsCorporate boards, ranging from about five to more than a dozen members, wrestle with complex challenges, including fluctuating profits, shareholder revolts and corporate raiders. Also on their agendas: environmental impact, climate change, social justice and how the company is governed.Directors — chosen for their expertise in strategy, finances, legal issues, digital transformation and marketing — attend an average of eight meetings a year and their compensation at the 500 most valuable U.S. companies averaged $316,000 last year, according to consulting firm Spencer Stuart.“Corporate boards are where companies’ culture is established, how they make decisions and target resources,"" said Assemblyman Chris Holden (D-Pasadena), a former Black caucus chair and the main author of a landmark California law in 2020 that mandated racial and ethnic diversity on company boards.Diverse directors can offer fresh perspectives.Aguilera cites a large consumer products company, which she declined to name, whose board planned to look for new markets abroad. A Latina director pushed back. “She argued, ‘We have an untapped market here, right in our back yard, which is the Latino market.’ She influenced growth and shareholder value.”But frustration over the slow pace of progress is spurring bold tactics. Latino Voices for Boardroom Equity, a coalition including civil rights groups UnidosUS and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, has launched a public online tracker showing how many Latinos, if any, are on the board of each Fortune 1000 company.So far, 650 lack any Latino director. The group's mission: Increase the ratio of Latino directors to 1 in 5 — equivalent to the Latino share of the U.S. population.The coalition first targeted U.S. companies based in the Golden State, and not just due to its huge Latino population. The group aimed to boost enforcement of that 2020 director law, Assembly Bill 979, which was the first in the nation to target race and ethnicity.The measure required publicly traded companies based in California to appoint directors from “underrepresented” communities."" The definition included individuals self-identifying as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.An earlier law in 2018, also a first, had ordered California companies to appoint female directors. Both board measures are mired in litigation. Conservative challengers argue that any quotas violate the California Constitution's equal-protection clause.“We are outraged that companies like Facebook, Netflix, PayPal, PG&amp;E, Molina Healthcare, Ross Stores, Chipotle Mexican Grill, El Pollo Loco, and Del Taco Restaurants have no Latinos on their board of directors,” declared a coalition statement in late 2020, amplified by a social media campaign.The strategy drew results. Since the call-out, seven of the nine companies have added Latinos to their boards — all except Netflix and Molina Healthcare.A Molina spokesperson said the company’s next new director will be Latino or Latina. A Netflix spokesperson said, “We've met with the Latino Voices for Boardroom Equity and look forward to continued discussions.""Over the last two years, the coalition has written to more than 580 chief executives of publicly traded California corporations declaring it “unacceptable” that “your company profits from Latino culture and Latino purchasing power, but your corporation has no Latinos on its board of directors.”The letters, offering to provide lists of “highly qualified” candidates, request meetings to discuss diversity plans “inclusive of Latinos.” But the tally is so far underwhelming: Just 3.7% of the directors of California’s largest 505 companies are Latino, according to a January survey by the data analytics firm ISS Corporate Solutions. That compares with 14.6% who are Asian and 6.2% who are Black.Why boards lack LatinosLatino leaders say their corporate struggles are in part related to a dearth of positive portrayals in movies and television along with the media’s intense focus on illegal immigration, leading to negative stereotyping.“We’re often seen as the housekeepers, the farmworkers, the mechanics,” said former California Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens), co-author of the board diversity bill. “Culturally, this sense of what we are eligible to do limits us.”Among U.S. professionals, a quarter are Latino, a five-point gain over the last decade and higher than Latinos' general population share, according to a McKinsey report last year.But recently a Latina financier who manages client assets of $2 billion told Aguilera that she has attended business meetings where “someone will tell her, ‘Oh, can you clean the table?’ That's people's perceptions,” Aguilera said.Momentum and timing are also factors.The Executive Leadership Council, a group aimed at promoting Black executives, was formed in 1986 — 27 years before the Latino Corporate Directors Assn. And George Floyd’s murder in May 2020, while fueling the push to hold corporate boards accountable on diversity, boosted the appointment of Black directors far more than those from other racial and ethnic groups.Among the largest 3,000 public corporations, the proportion of Black directors has surged 90% since 2019 — more than any other racial or ethnic group, according to an ISS Corporate Solutions analysis.By comparison, the share of Asians rose 55% and Latinos, 37%. The proportion of white directors fell 9% to 79.9% of the more than 26,000 directors.“The civil unrest brought issues of equity and disenfranchisement to the fore,” said Holden, the California diversity law author. “In a state with a majority minority population, why weren’t we seeing greater progress?”After the Floyd video release, ""you had a lot of corporations making promises about diversity,” co-author Garcia said. “We saw an opportunity — let’s make good on those promises, starting with corporate boards.”But merely requiring companies to source from a broad swath of underrepresented communities, without differentiating by race or ethnicity, ended up shortchanging Latinos, she said.“Companies think, ‘We checked off the minority box. We have a Black person or a gay person.’ But they haven’t lifted all boats equitably.”Holden calls the law “a toe in the water. If you pick one director from any one of these underrepresented groups, you’re in compliance,” he said. “But the numbers show a gross under-representation for Hispanics. Companies must find ways of recruiting [and] maybe add more positions to their boards.”Even if ultimately invalidated in court, the California law’s approach — measuring diversity through a wide lens of underrepresented groups — dovetails with a national template.Corporations on the Nasdaq stock exchange must publicly disclose their board demographics. They must have at least one female director or one “underrepresented minority” or LGBTQ+ director by the end of this year, and, for larger boards, two by the end of 2025. Or they must explain why they don’t.But companies can satisfy the rule without appointing any Latinos — and many have done so. They “clump” diverse directors together, Trujillo said. “A minority is a minority is a minority, right?”The percentage of Asian directors has also grown faster than that of Latinos, in part because companies expanding into China, India and Southeast Asia “wanted Asian board members that could relate to the Asian market space,” Trujillo said.Julie Daum, a board expert at Spencer Stuart, said companies particularly focused on recruiting Black directors after the George Floyd murder, and if fewer Latinos are appointed, “it’s not that they’re excluding people.""“The notion of diversity is that you have different points of view in the room, people who don’t all look alike,” Daum said. “So they're using the category ‘underrepresented,' but I don’t think it’s that you need one of this and one of that.“Are we going to say, ‘I'm blond. Now we need a person who has dark hair in the room because blonds have a different experience’? We have to be very careful about dividing us all into teeny tiny little bits.”Diversity boosts profitsAguilera and other activists are leaning on institutional investors, including pension funds and banks, to pressure companies to appoint Latino directors. They cite recent studies from organizations such as McKinsey,  Carlyle Group and the nonprofit BoardReady, reporting that diversity correlates with higher profits.Although large investors are not pledging to specifically advocate for Latino directors, they are pushing for general diversity, including women and minority directors.Goldman Sachs has said it would help companies go public only if they have at least two diverse board members. Glass Lewis, the proxy advisory services firm, is recommending voting against board nominating committee chairs at companies with no directors from underrepresented communities.“Institutional investors are powerful,” Aguilera said. “They want different perspectives in the boardroom. They’ve been writing letters for women. I said, ‘Why aren't you writing letters for Latinos?’ And they said, 'Give us the data.’”The collaborative’s GDP report makes an economic case: From 2010 to 2020, Latinos accounted for more than half of U.S. population growth and their consumption grew more than three times faster than that of non-Latinos.The directors association offers a database of several thousand experienced Latino executives eager for board appointments, many of whom have trained in the organization’s workshops.""The saying is, if you’re not in the boardroom, you’re on the menu, right?"" Aguilera said. ""Well, Latinos, we’re not even on the menu. We’re not in the room. We’re not even in the darn elevator.”The group plans to ramp up public pressure, launching media campaigns comparing companies by industry — for instance, contrasting Target, with three Latina directors, to other large retailers with none.“There’s a lot of competition between companies,"" Aguilera said. ""When you put their names out there, they’ll listen.”Target’s Latino board members are Monica Lozano, former chair of U.S. Hispanic Media Inc., Grace Puma, the retired PepsiCo Inc. chief operations officer, and Melanie Healey, a former Procter &amp; Gamble group president. And that diversity won CEO Brian Cornell a high-profile slot at the San Diego conference, where he stressed “how important the Latino consumer is for our future growth” and pledged to keep expanding Target's staff of 120,000 Latino employees.“Give Brian a great round of applause,” Trujillo urged the crowd. “We don't talk about diversity and inclusion. We talk about business. And if you're a good businessperson, you're going to know who your customers are.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"
