Like many energy companies, it returned much of the free cash flow to shareholders in the form of $39 million in dividends, $400 million in share repurchases and $1.1 billion in debt reduction.The key for the energy producers is the 2023 production and the capital guidance plan.

Aflac, Unum Group, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees.While it boosts employees’ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates should continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #4, which places it in the top 2% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has moved up 4.9% in a year.We present a few stocks one can buy or retain, given their business advancement endeavors. But before that it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Accident and Health Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 13.5% in the past year against the Finance sector’s decline of 8% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decrease of 11% over the same period.Current ValuationOn the basis of a trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.61X compared with the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s 5.49X and the sector’s 3.5X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.69X, as low as 0.58X and at the median of 1.15X.4 Accident &amp; Health Insurance Stocks to Add for Better ReturnsWe are presenting two Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks and two Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks from the Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at CF Industries Holdings' (NYSE:CF) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for CF Industries Holdings, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.45 = US$5.6b ÷ (US$13b - US$995m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, CF Industries Holdings has an ROCE of 45%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Chemicals industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for CF Industries Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for CF Industries Holdings.The Trend Of ROCECF Industries Holdings is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 2,478% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo bring it all together, CF Industries Holdings has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.CF Industries Holdings does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for CF Industries Holdings  that you might be interested in.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Canadian Natural delivered strong operational results in 2022, as we achieved record annual production of approximately 1.28 million BOEs per day, an increase of 4% over 2021 levels, which included approximately 933,000 barrels a day of liquid production and record annual natural gas production of approximately 2.1 Bcf per day. As a result of our diverse portfolio, which is supported by our robust long-life, low-decline assets, primarily in the Oil Sands Mining and thermal in situ combined with our capital discipline, we generated significant free cash flow. And as we continued balancing free cash flow to our four pillars of capital allocation maximizing value for our shareholders.Story continuesIn 2022, we exited with a net debt of approximately $10.5 billion. We returned approximately $10.5 billion to our shareholders, $5.6 billion in share repurchases and $4.9 billion in dividends. And today, we announced a further 6% increase in our dividend. In 2022, the company's total proved reserves increased by 6% to nearly 13.6 billion BOEs, this resulted in a 265% replacement of 2022 production, at an FD&amp;A metric of $8.39 per BOE, including changes in further development costs. Notably, greater than 50% of the company's total proved reserves are high-value, zero-decline SCO. As we continue to progress our ESG initiative, deliver industry leading performance across the board, a significant factor in our long-term sustainability. In November 2022, we announced our new environmental GHG target to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute emissions by 40% by 2035, as we leverage technology, innovation to reduce our environmental footprint while ensuring safe, reliable, effective and efficient operations.We are working collaborative through the Pathways Alliance to achieve our goal of net zero in the Oil Sands, equally as important is that we work together with both Federal and provincial governments to achieve climate goals in an economically sustainable manner. As well, Canadian Natural is an industry leader in abandonment and reclamation as we have abandoned over 3,000 wells in the last two years, each in the last two years. And at this pace, we could have abandon our current inventory of inactive wells in just 10 years. I will now do a brief overview of our assets, starting with natural gas. Overall, 2022 annual natural gas production was approximately 2.1 Bcf per day, which is a 23% increase over 2021 production levels. For North American operations, 2022 annual natural gas production was approximately 2.08 Bcf per day versus the 1.68 Bcf for 2021, up almost approximately 395 million cubic feet per day, primarily as a result of the company's strategic decision to invest in liquid-rich natural gas areas through our drill-to-fill strategy, adding low-cost, high-value, liquid-rich gas production as well as opportunistic acquisitions completed late 2021 and early 2022.On an annual basis, our 2022 North American natural gas operating cost was $1.19 per Mcf, an increase of 3% from 2021 of $1.15 per Mcf, primarily due to increased energy costs. For the fourth quarter of 2021, North American natural gas production was approximately 2.1 Bcf versus 1.84 for Q4 2021, with operating cost of $1.22 per Mcf versus $1.08 in 2021, once again, reflecting the higher cost of energy. Our teams continue to focus on operational excellence, and we had a successful natural gas drilling program, which included 50 net wells in Q4 2022, bringing the total natural gas wells drilled in the year to 72 net wells. For North American light oil and NGL the 2022 annual production was approximately 110,000 barrels a day, up 16% from 2021, primarily as a result of strong drilling results.Annual operating costs were strong at $15.91 per barrel versus 2021 operating costs of $15.28. Q4 production was 112,989 barrels per day, again, up 16% when comparing to Q4 2021, with quarterly operating costs of $16.47 per barrel as compared to Q4 '21 costs of $14.61 per barrel, again, primarily a result of higher energy costs. The company delivered strong execution and results in the high-value Montney light crude oil and Deep Basin developments in 2022. And as budgeted, a total of 32 net wells were brought on stream. For international assets in 2022 had an annual production of 27,233 barrels a day, a 14% decrease versus 2021 levels, primarily due to maintenance activities in the North Sea and natural field declines. Offshore annual production was 14,343 barrels per day versus 2021 of approximately 14,000 barrels with annual operating costs in 2022 of $17.25 per barrel versus 2021 at $14.73.In the North Sea, annual production averaged 12,890 barrels in 2022, down from the 2021 level of 17,633 barrels per day and an annual cost of approximately $89 per barrel. As a result, of the North Sea regulatory and economic conditions, including the impact of higher natural gas and carbon prices going forward, we're accelerating our plan for the COP and abandonment of the 2 Ninian platforms by four to five years earlier than originally envisioned. This follows the company's successful abandonment to the Ninian North platform using the single lift technology in 2022. Moving to heavy oil, the 2022 annual production was approximately 67,700 barrels a day in 2022, an increase of 5% versus 2021, reflecting strong drilling results, increased development activity offset by natural field decline.Annual operating costs were $21.84 per barrel versus the 2021 operating cost of $19.37 per barrel. Fourth quarter 2022 production was 72,161 barrels per day, primarily a result of strong drilling activity versus the Q4 2021 production of 64,866 barrels a day. Operating costs were $21.28 per barrel versus Q4 operating costs in 2021 of $19.72 per barrel, again impacted by higher energy costs. In 2022, the company drilled a total of 127 net horizontal multi-lat heavy oil wells, including 52 net wells at Smith in the Clearwater. The company's Clearwater production averaged approximately 13,000 BOEs per day in Q4 2022, up approximately 9,100 BOEs per day from the start of the year. A key component of our long life, low decline assets is a world-class Pelican Lake pool, where our leading-edge polymer flood continues to deliver significant value.Oil, Gas, EnergyPhoto by Grant Durr on UnsplashThe 2022 annual production was 50,333 barrels per day versus the 2021 average of 54,390 barrels per day, a 7% decline. The team continues to focus on operating costs with the annual operating costs of $8.36 per barrel, an increase from our 2021 operating cost of $6.75 per barrel, again, primarily a result of increased energy costs incurred during the year. Fourth quarter 2022 production was approximately 48,000 barrels a day, down 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately 53,000 barrels a day. This primarily is a reflection of the temporary injection reduction in Q4 2022 and natural field declines. In February, injection rates have been fully restated and the polymer flood is expected to return to its historical low decline rate of approximately 5% in the second half of 2023.Operating costs in Q4 2022 were $9.14 per barrel versus Q4 2021 of $6.78 per barrel. With our low decline, low operating costs, Pelican Lake continues to have excellent netbacks. We had a good year in our thermal in situ operations in 2022 as we continued to leverage our continuous improvement culture and our expertise to deliver effective and efficient operations. In 2022, we had annual production of approximately 252,000 barrels a day versus 2021 levels of approximately 259,000 barrels a day. Thermal annual operating costs were $16.50 per barrel, up from 2021 levels of $12.14 per barrel, primarily as a result of increased energy costs. Q4 2022 production was strong at 253,188 barrels per day, down 4% from Q4 2021 levels, with operating costs of $17.20 per barrel, reflecting higher energy costs when compared to Q4 2021 of $13.08 per barrel.At Primrose, we finished drilling at two CSS pads in Q4 and we target to bring these pads on in early Q3 2023. At Kirby, the development of the four SAGD pads is on track. The first pad began steaming late December 2022 and targets to wrap up the full production capacity in Q3 2023, with the remaining three pads targeted for full ramp-up in 2024. At Jackfish, the company is currently drilling a SAGD pad, which is targeted to be its steam in early Q4 2023 with the ramp-up of full production capacity in 2024. As well, we are continuing to progress our engineering design of the commercial scale solvent SAGD development at Kirby North and target to commence solvent injection in early 2024. At Canadian Natural's world-class Oil Sands Mining and upgrading assets, we had an annual production averaging 425,945 barrels a day of SCO, a decrease of 5% from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of unplanned downtime at both Scotford and Horizon during the year.We had annual 2022 operating costs averaging $26.04 per barrel versus 2021 operating costs of $20.91 per barrel. The company continues to focus on high reliability, cost control as well as operational enhancements. At our Oil Sands Mining operations, we had production of 428,784 in the fourth quarter of 2022, with a fourth quarter operating costs of $25.48 per barrel of SCO. Our quarterly production was impacted as a result of the October unplanned maintenance at both Scotford and Horizon, which we talked to in our November Q3 2022 results. Then with the extreme cold weather in December, we had to complete multiple mining equipment repairs, resulting in the reduced rate at Horizon for both December 2022 and January 2023. This event is targeted to impact Q1 production by approximately 25,000 barrels a day.Production from the Oil Sands Mining and upgrading assets averaged approximately 483,000 barrels a day in February 2023. The reliability enhancement project at Horizon continues to progress well and is now targeted to be 45 days ahead, increasing SCO production capacity earlier than originally budgeted. The impact of this project was approximately 5,000 barrels a day on an annual basis for 2023, increasing to approximately 14,000 barrels a day in 2025. As a result of the advancement of the reliability project, and the reduced rates in Q1 and the thermal and Oil Sands Mining and upgrading 2023 production guidance remains unchanged. For the second quarter, both Scotford and Horizon will start their planned 2023 turnaround. Scotford targeted to start in April at reduced rates for 73 days and Horizon is targeted for a full shutdown in May for 28 days.I will now turn it over to Trevor for our 2022 reserves review.Trevor Cassidy: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Consistent with previous years, 100% of Canadian Natural's reserves are externally evaluated and reviewed by independent, qualified reserve evaluators. Our 2022 reserve disclosure is presented in accordance with Canadian reporting requirements, using forecasted commodity pricing and escalated costs. Canadian standards also require disclosure of reserves on a company working interest before royalty basis. As you just heard from Tim, Canadian Natural had another strong year, and the results are also demonstrated in Canadian Natural's reserves. Total proved and total proved plus probable reserves increased 6% to 13.6 billion BOE and 18 billion BOE, respectively. Of the 13.6 billion BOE of total proved reserves, 65% or 8.8 billion BOE are proved developed producing reserves.The strength and depth of Canadian Natural assets are evident as approximately 77% of total proved reserves are long-life, low-decline reserves. Again, it's also important to note that approximately half of Canadian Natural's total proved reserves are high value, no decline synthetic crude oil at 6.9 billion BOE. Also worth noting is that the company's total proved plus probable natural gas reserves increased 10% to 22.3 Tcf, the largest natural gas reserves in Canada. This provides Canadian Natural with top-tier, long, reserve life index of 32 years for total proved and 42 years for total proved plus probable. Findings and development costs and reserve replacements are key indicators of the strength of our assets. In 2022, Canadian Natural continued to achieve strong performance as reflected in our finding and development costs and reserve replacement metrics.The corporate finding, development and acquisition costs, including changes in future development costs, are $8.39 per BOE for total proved and $7.62 per BOE for total proved plus probable reserves. Canadian Natural replaced 2022 production by 265% for total proved and 334% for total proved plus probable reserves. The net present value of future net revenues before income taxes using a 10% discount rate and including the full company ARO, is approximately $151 billion for total proved reserves and approximately $184 billion for total proved plus probable reserves. In summary, these strong results reflect the strength and depth of Canadian Natural's asset base, the value of the company's long-life, low-decline reserves and our ability to execute and maximize value from our reserve base.Thank you. I'll now hand it over to Mark for financial highlights.Mark Stainthorpe: Thanks, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter financial results were strong and adjusted funds flow of $4.2 billion and adjusted net earnings from operations of $2.2 billion, driving full year 2022 adjusted funds flow of $19.8 billion and annual adjusted net earnings of $12.9 billion. Net earnings for 2022 were $10.9 billion, including a onetime noncash charge in Q4 of $651 million related to the acceleration of abandonment on two platforms in the North Sea. These strong financial results drove material free cash flow in 2022 as we balance our four pillars, including returns to shareholders. We returned a total of approximately $10.5 billion to shareholders through $4.9 billion in dividends and $5.6 billion through share repurchases, equaling about 77 million shares repurchased in 2022; while at the same time, reducing our net debt level by $3.4 billion.Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.90 per common share from $0.85 per common share. This follows the two dividend increases totaling 45% in 2022 and demonstrates the confidence that the Board has in the sustainability of our business model, the strength of our balance sheet and the nature of our diverse long-life, low-decline assets and high-value reserve base. This continues the company's leading track record now with 23 consecutive years of dividend increases, with a significant compound annual growth rate of 21% over that period of time. Our strong financial position continues to get stronger. Debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is up 0.5x at the end of 2022. We've reduced net debt by approximately $10.7 billion since the beginning of 2021, and we continue to maintain strong liquidity.Including revolving bank facilities, cash and short-term investments, liquidity at the end of 2022 was approximately $6.9 billion. As a result of this strong financial position and having a sustainable cash flow profile, particularly when you compare our debt levels to the size, diversity and long life, low decline nature of our high-value reserves, we have enhanced our free cash flow allocation policy. As the Board of Directors has confidence in the sustainability and resilience of the company to support accelerating incremental shareholder returns to a 100% of free cash flow when the company's net debt reaches $10 billion instead of the previous $8 billion net debt level. Once the company's net debt reaches $10 billion, the free cash flow allocation will be adjusted to define free cash flow as adjusted funds flow less dividends, less total capital expenditures.Based on strip prices today and taking into account the final 2022 tax installment in Q1, capital profile and our current shareholder return framework, including dividends and a significant share buyback program, we target to reach the $10 billion net debt level late this year. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation, our focus on a strong financial position and our effective and efficient business model is unique and drives material free cash flow. This provides significant returns to shareholders and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Tim, for some final comments.Tim McKay: Thank you, Mark. Canadian Natural's advantage is our ability to effectively allocate cash flow to our four pillars. We have a well-balanced, diverse, large asset base, which a significant portion is long-life, low-decline assets, which require less capital to maintain volumes. We are balanced in our commodities. In 2022, approximately 44% of our BOEs, light crude oil and SCO; 29% heavy oil and 27% natural gas, which lessens our exposure to the volatility in any one commodity as we move through 2023. We continue to allocate cash flow to our four pillars in a disciplined manner to maximize value for our shareholders, which is all driven by effective capital allocation, effective and efficient operations by our teams who deliver top-tier results.We have a robust, sustainable free cash flow; and through our free cash flow allocation, returns to shareholders have been significant. For 2022, $4.9 billion in dividend and $5.6 billion in share repurchases for a total of $10.5 billion. And today, our dividend was increased by 6% for the 23rd consecutive year and has a CAGR of 21% -- approximately 21% over that time. In summary, we will continue to focus on safe, reliable operations, enhancing our top-tier operations and we'll continue to drive our environmental performance. We are in a strong position and being nimble enhances our capacity to create value for our shareholders. Canadian Natural is delivering top-tier free cash flow generation, which is unique, sustainable and robust, and clearly demonstrates our ability to both economically grow the business and deliver returns to shareholders by balancing our four pillars.With that, I will now open the call for questions.See also 12 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy and 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Winning bidders are expected to be picked next month.Guyana Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo on Monday spoke at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston to drum up support for the country's first competitive bidding round.""We see this as big, transformative for our people. We are in a mad rush to get this done before net-zero comes,"" he told Reuters, referring to the target to slash fossil fuel use by 2050.He plans to meet with U.S. government officials, international and state-run oil firms while in Houston.Companies interested in the April round have paid for seismic data to evaluate the blocks and decide whether to submit offers, according to the government. They include six big international producers, Energy Minister Vickram Bharrat has said, without identifying the companies.None of the companies have decided on bids as they wait for the government to release contract terms, the people familiar with the matter said.Guyana is considering a state investment firm that would hold stakes with partners in offshore blocks offered through government-to-government talks, Jagdeo said. The investment firm would not be an operator, he added.Guyana estimates it has up to 25 billion barrels of oil and gas in place off its coast. A consortium that includes Exxon Mobil, Hess and CNOOC operates the country's most important area, the 6.6-million-acre (26,800 sq km) Stabroek block, with more than 30 discoveries to date.Exxon, QatarEnergy, Shell PLC, Chevron Corp and Petrobras are among the oil giants that have paid $20,000 for the geologic information available on the 11 shallow water and three deep-water blocks, the people familiar with the matter said.Story continuesChevron's main interest is to gain access to Guyana's geological data, three of the people said, noting the company has blocks in neighboring Suriname and Venezuela.Exxon and QatarEnergy have said they are waiting for the full contract terms to consider a bid. Shell said it is evaluating the offshore lease sale to determine a possible participation. Chevron and Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment.Guyana also has begun direct negotiations on the 14 blocks and other areas with governments that have state-controlled oil companies.

According to the bidding round plan, the winners would be disclosed between late May and early June after an evaluation, Jagdeo said.The proposed rules will nearly double the government's take from oil production to 27.5% of royalties and profit oil, plus a new 10% corporate tax, compared to Exxon's main contract.The new agreement also will require producers provide more information to Guyana, the vice president said.""We believe it is asymmetric now, and a bit in favor of the companies,"" Jagdeo said. ""We want more information to come from the oil and gas companies.""The new agreement will request details of the production costs that companies deduct before splitting oil revenue with the country, he said. The Exxon group can now use 75% of the oil production to offset a variety of costs, including construction of its new Guyana headquarters.The oil model also will set stricter terms for tendering and procurement, covering everything from production vessels to drilling suppliers. However, the terms will not affect Exxon's Stabroek block.""We are not renegotiating Stabroek,"" Jagdeo said.

The company’s main Arab Light grade was lifted to $2.50 a barrel above the regional benchmark, 50 cents more than the level for March.That was in line with a Bloomberg survey of refiners and traders, which forecast a rise of 55 cents. It’s the second month running for which Aramco has increased prices for Asia, it’s biggest market.Prices for US customers were left unchanged. Those for North-West Europe and the Mediterranean jumped by as much as $1.30 a barrel.Brent crude has dipped 1% this year to just above $85 a barrel. It’s fallen from around $115 since mid-2022, with a slowing global economy and higher interest rates countering supply disruptions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Aramco’s chief executive officer suggested last week he sees a turnaround.“The demand from China is very strong,” Amin Nasser told Bloomberg in Riyadh on March 1. It’s also “excellent” in Europe and the US, he said.Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter and leads the OPEC+ group of producers along with Russia. The 23-nation alliance has suggested it will not raise production until at least next year.Aramco sells about 60% of its crude shipments to Asia, most of them under long-term contracts, pricing for which is reviewed each month.

14,3d906773-e481-34bb-8fc0-bacc52060de3,OMC,2023-03-06,TBWA's Backslash Reveals 39 Cultural Shifts Shaping Our World,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tbwas-backslash-reveals-39-cultural-120000708.html,1678104000,STORY,['OMC'],"[In the face of cultural chaos, Edges offer a strategic blueprint for the year aheadLOS ANGELES, March 6, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Backslash, the cultural intelligence unit of TBWA\Worldwide, has released its annual glossary of Edges. More than a trend report, Edges are defined as meaningful cultural shifts that have the scale and longevity to help brands capture a greater share of the future.Backslash 2023 Edges""Culture is not only accelerating, it's also becoming messier—making it harder for brands to keep up, make sense of where they can play, and determine what to act on. That's where Edges come in,"" says Agathe Guerrier, TBWA\Worldwide's Global Chief Strategy Officer.Backslash's rigorous set of criteria requires Edges be rooted in human values, be recognizable through consumer behaviors, and lead to clear business implications. In order to be declared an Edge, identified shifts must have sustained relevance for over a year and should continue to matter for the foreseeable future. Each Edge must also be globally relevant, manifesting in a majority of the world's regions.This year's 39 Edges span categories and countries, offering a comprehensive forecast of what's to come. Six new Edges have been identified for 2023, including:Artificial Creativity: Creativity is undergoing an AI revolution. Giant leaps in the progression and availability of generative AI tools are driving a shift from purely logical, task-oriented applications to more artful, previously impossible outputs. As AI pushes further into creative industries, culture wars around ownership, value, and definitions of ""real"" creativity will ensue.Lab-Made World: Beef, blood, building materials: the future is being grown in a lab. While ""all-natural"" was once thought to be better for people and the planet, our current environmental reality calls for a different approach. One that begins with science. As resources run out and supply chains fall under scrutiny, ""lab-made"" will go from sterile and apologetic to responsible and aspirational.Story continuesNeo-Collectivism: A renewed emphasis on collectivism is redistributing power at scale. Realizing that individualism can only get us so far, brands and organizations are relinquishing control and inviting participation in the form of decentralization, crowdsourcing, and co-creation. The future belongs to all of us.When looking across the 2023 Edges, major themes like resource scarcity, taboo toppling, and tech backlash sit at the root of several separate but related shifts. Each of these conversations have become seismic pressures underpinning the rest.""Together, overlapping Edges tell a larger story about where culture is heading. Other Edges inherently contradict one another, which creates an even more interesting narrative full of cultural tensions,"" says Backslash's Director of Cultural Strategy, Cecelia Girr. ""The reality is that no cultural shift is good or bad. They all encompass various perspectives and a great deal of nuance, which means there's several different ways for brands to leverage them.""To help clients better understand which Edges influence their audiences, TBWA' Disruption Index—a data product spanning 18 countries— collects cultural relevance and economic impact data from thousands of people worldwide. This has allowed TBWA to quantify the impact of Edges against a particular brand or category, giving clients the confidence to build a long-term strategy upon them.For instance, Disruption Index data found Body Debates (an Edge introduced in 2021) was the most relevant Edge in around 70% of the markets last year—with an average of 84% of consumers saying it is ""very important to be able to make decisions about their body and health."" For healthcare clients, such an insight can unlock richer creative territories centered around body autonomy and empowered decision making.To help further inspire business action, this year's Edge glossary also includes provocations for the future of brand experience. These insights were born from a partnership between Backslash and TBWA's global innovation practice, NEXT.The complete glossary of 39 Edges can be downloaded at https://www.backslash.com/edgesAbout BackslashBackslash is a cultural intelligence unit powered by a global network of over 300 Culture Spotters from 70 offices across the TBWA collective.

The lower court in Islamabad said it was rejecting the petition as Khan did not make an appearance during the hearing of his petition.Khan, 70, plans to appeal to the Islamabad High Court while a verdict from the Lahore court is still pending, another of his lawyers Gohar Ali Khan said.Pakistan authorities on Sunday moved to arrest Khan in central city of Lahore for not showing up to a court hearing but said he wasn’t immediately found. Khan later addressed supporters at his home and his party has now told the police that the leader will comply with the legal process, Islamabad police spokesman Taqi Jawad said in a text message.Khan, who has drawn tens of thousands to his rallies in recent months, has been pressurizing the government for early elections since he was ousted from power in April last year. Khan has seen multiple legal cases filed against him in the past year while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has vowed to complete his term that ends in August.The arrest warrant was issued last week after Khan did not appear several times for a hearing related to a complaint over his failure to declare his assets. The Election Commission had disqualified the former cricket star in October for allegedly hiding money earned from selling state gifts that he received when he was prime minister.Story continuesThe next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday and police were supposed to arrest Khan and bring him to court.The episode underscores how Pakistan’s political tensions are only set to heat up ahead of the election, posing a risk to Sharif’s efforts to secure bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund to fend off potential bankruptcy.Pakistan’s central bank last week raised its benchmark interest rate to a 25-year high as Moody’s Investors Services downgraded the nation deeper into junk on concerns about debt payments as default nears.

According to Forbes, Gates' net worth was at a staggering $110 billion as of March 2023.Check Out: Dave Ramsey's 7 Tips for Paying Off a Mortgage FasterAdvice: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000These days, Gates is more interested in giving his money away than he is in acquiring more. In 2010, Gates -- along with his now ex-wife, Melinda, and fellow multi-billionaire Warren Buffett -- co-founded The Giving Pledge, which encourages the world's wealthiest people to give away most of their fortunes to charity. He has donated at least $35.8 billion in stock from Microsoft, the company he co-founded, to his own Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, according to Forbes. In 2021, they made a multiyear pledge of $15 billion to the foundation, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported.Budding entrepreneurs and philanthropists want to know how Gates amassed his fortune so that they might join the Billionaires' Club one day. Here are a few habits that helped Bill Gates become a massive success.©Cj Gunther/EPA/ShutterstockHe Has a Thirst for KnowledgeGates attended Harvard University only briefly before he dropped out, yet he attributes his time there to his success.""It was an amazing privilege (studying at Harvard); and, though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made, and the ideas I worked on,"" Gates said in a 2007 commencement speech.Gates studied computers, but he also dabbled in many other subjects that interested him at the Ivy League school.""Academic life was fascinating,"" he said during the speech. ""I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn't even signed up for.""This thirst for knowledge and his willingness to always improve and learn contributed to the growth of his eventual business.He remains a staunch supporter of education. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation launched the Global Education Program in 2018 with a focus on teaching reading and math skills to primary school children in sub-Saharan Africa and India.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Would You Move for a Job That Paid You a $10,000 Signing Bonus?©John Froschauer/AP/ShutterstockHis Parents Were SupportiveWhen asked in 1998 about his role models, Gates said he looked up to his parents. Gates' parents nurtured and supported his interest in computers as well -- even after he decided to abandon his Harvard education. Gates' father, Bill Gates Sr., told Forbes that his son's decision to drop out of college ""wasn't precisely what my wife and I had envisioned for any of our children.""However, Gates' parents were extremely supportive of his endeavors after that. After Gates' mother died in 1994, she helped her son ""get the contract that led to a lucrative relationship with IBM for his fledgling Microsoft Corporation,"" according to The New York Times.As for his father, Gates long cited him as an inspiration for his philanthropic work, which has dominated the younger Gates' time and energies since he left his day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008. The elder Gates was actively involved in his son's philanthropic work -- he even wrote the first check for Gates' foundation -- until his death in 2020 at the age of 94.Bill Gates is the father of three children -- daughters Jennifer and Phoebe, born in 1996 and 2002, and son Rory, born in 1999. In interviews and speeches, he has given his ex-wife credit for 80% of the child rearing and said they followed the ""love and logic"" parenting method of the 1970s.Leon Neal / AP / Shutterstock.comHe Reads a LotIn the Forbes interview, Gates' father said his son was an incredibly avid reader as a child.""Just about every kind of book interested him -- encyclopedias, science fiction, you name it,"" he said. ""I was thrilled that my child was such an avid reader, but he read so much that Bill's mother and I had to institute a rule: no books at the dinner table.""That hasn't changed. In 2021, in honor of World Book Day, he tweeted about his passion.""I try to read every day, whether I have a busy day at the office or am out for a hike,"" he wrote. ""It's one of my favorite ways to learn new things and better understand the world.""Reading likely contributed to Gates' net worth, as it helped provide him with the knowledge he would need to become a successful entrepreneur. He recommends books on his blog, GatesNotes.©Photo courtesy of Living Computers: Museum + LabsHe Chose a Great Business PartnerGates has made countless brilliant business decisions, many of which have involved the people he has chosen to work with.""I'd say my best business decisions really have to do with picking people,"" Gates said in the 1998 interview. ""Deciding to go into partnership with Paul Allen is probably at the top of the list.""Allen and Gates were friends growing up, and they co-founded Microsoft in 1975. Allen left the company eight years later, after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. A fellow philanthropist who gave away more than $2 billion, Allen owned the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers at the time of his death, at age 65, in 2018 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Throughout the years, Gates and Allen had a ""complex relationship,"" as outlined in Allen's book, ""Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft."" However, Gates attributes Microsoft's early success to his partnership with Allen and the many lessons they learned along the way.$2,000 Quarter? Check Your Pockets Before You Use This 2004 Coinlembi / Shutterstock.comHe Has Remained Passionate About His WorkAs many entrepreneurs have said, you must love what you do if you hope to be successful. Bill Gates fell in love with computers as a child and spent a lifetime building one of the most successful businesses in the world.""You've got to enjoy what you do every day, and for me that's working with very smart people,"" Gates said in 1998. ""It's working on new problems. ... The competition, the breakthroughs, the research make the field I'm in, I think, the most exciting field there is.""Even though he left his day-to-day role at Microsoft more than a decade ago, Gates served as Microsoft's chairman of the board. In 2020, however, he left the board to focus solely on his philanthropic work.Sean Pavone / Getty Images/iStockphotoHe Stayed Confident in His Dream and VisionGates was fortunate to attend Lakeside School, an elite private school in Seattle that gave him access to computers when he was in the seventh grade. Instead of just teaching students how to use computers in the conventional sense, the school ""unleashed"" them, according to Gates. Looking back, he said his experiences at the school gave him the vision and encouragement he needed to do the impossible.His vision continues today, though on a different front. His aim now is to better arm the world to fight the threat from future pandemics. The Gates Foundation, as of January 2022, had given more than $2 billion to vaccines and other efforts related to COVID-19.Gates has written a book, ""How to Prevent the Next Pandemic,"" which is due for release on May 3, 2022.©Dwayne Newton/AP/ShutterstockHe Had an Emergency Fund for MicrosoftGates learned early that, in order to be successful, he had to amass a large emergency fund for Microsoft, which would keep the business afloat if it ever encountered financial obstacles.""I always had to be careful that we wouldn't hire too many people,"" he said in a 2018 interview on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show."" ""I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, 'What if we don't get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?'""Next: 5 Things You Should Always Pay For With CashMario Tama / Getty ImagesHe Learned From His Mistakes With MicrosoftEveryone makes mistakes, including Gates. The key, however, is to learn from those errors, and that's exactly what Gates has done.At a 2019 Village Global event, Gates said his biggest mistake was not jumping into competition with Apple after it released its first iPhone in June 2007. Google did just that with its Android device in 2008.""These are winner-takes-all markets. So the greatest mistake ever is whatever mismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what Android is,"" he said. ""That was a natural thing for Microsoft to win.""©Glenn Copus/Evening Standard/ShutterstockHe Gets Seven Hours of SleepAlthough many successful businessmen like to brag about how little sleep they get, Gates is the opposite. He knows he's not superhuman and that sleep is required for his intellectual curiosity to be at its best.""I like to get seven hours of sleep,"" he told The Seattle Times in 1990. ""Even though it's fun to stay up all night -- maybe taking a red-eye flight -- if I have to be creative, I need seven hours.""He hasn't changed his mind in the ensuing years. In a December 2019 post on his blog, he doubled down. ""Does everyone really need seven or eight hours of sleep a night?"" he pondered. ""The answer is that you almost certainly do, even if you've convinced yourself otherwise. In the words of Dr. Thomas Roth, of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, 'The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without impairment, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.'Dimitrios Kambouris / Getty ImagesHe Learns From Those Around HimGates and legendary entrepreneur Warren Buffett became friends 30 years ago when the two met over Fourth of July weekend in 1991 in Seattle by chance -- not through business. Gates celebrated that friendship -- and Buffett's 90th birthday -- in a blog post in 2020 and discussed one of the ways Buffett has influenced him.""As Warren himself put it a few years ago when we spoke with some college students, 'You will move in the direction of the people that you associate with. So it's important to associate with people that are better than yourself,'"" Gates wrote. ""The friends you have will form you as you go through life. Make some good friends, keep them for the rest of your life, but have them be people that you admire as well as like.""I'm a Self-Made Millionaire: These Are the 6 Investments Everyone Should Make During an Economic Downturn©Mark Schiefelbein/AP/REX/ShutterHe Diversified His Private PortfolioWhen Gates was building Microsoft, he put most of his time, energy and creative talent into making it arguably the greatest tech company in the world. Once he got rich, however, he did what most financial advisors recommend investors do regardless of their net worth: He diversified. At the time he stepped down from the Microsoft board in March 2020, he owned about 1% of the company's stock, Forbes reported. He then used the cash to invest in a wide range of stocks and other assets that protected his massive portfolio from a single-security calamity. Forbes said he holds stock in Canadian National Railway and AutoNation and that he is among the largest owners of American farmland. CNBC reported in April 2022 that he also is an investor in Motif FoodWorks, a plant-based food company.Joe Marquette/AP/REX / Shutterstock.comHe Knew When He Had Outgrown PartnershipsMicrosoft's partnership with IBM formed the backbone of the 1980s personal computer revolution. The two companies collaborated to create the operating systems that breathed life into most PCs. By the early 1990s, however, the partnership had stagnated and Gates determined Microsoft would be better going it alone.The gamble paid off.When the separation was complete in 1992, IBM walked away with the jointly created OS/2 operating system and Microsoft left with the software that would make it king: MS-DOS and Windows. In 2016, Forbes wrote of Gates, ""His decision to divorce IBM stands as one of his best. Microsoft took control over its own destiny.""©Barry Sweet/AP/ShutterstockHe Learned To Give Up ControlAccording to a 2019 report from Inc., Gates found success only after he learned to trust the people he hired and delegate responsibility to them. That, however, required Gates to do something that was antithetical to his entire personality: Forfeit control.In Microsoft's early years, Gates maintained a tight grasp on everything that happened and did whatever he could himself, but how could he grow Microsoft to its full potential if he spent all day writing or editing code? He couldn't.Instead, he developed relationships with key employees, and those relationships were based on mutual trust. He found that the new mentality allowed him to take on the role of mentor instead of micromanager, which, it turns out, suited him well.This ability to be creative, work with his team and have a big enough cash cushion to continuously grow and try new things contributed greatly to Microsoft's success and, eventually, Gates' fortune.Read: 5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretChip Somodevilla / Getty ImagesHe Has Remained Passionate About His WorkAs many entrepreneurs have said, you must love what you do if you hope to be successful.

Starbucks also gave its baristas a pay rise last year, reflecting intense competition in the labour market and a cost of living squeeze on workers.As costs soared last year, Stabucks raised the price of some espresso drinks and iced beverages by approximately 4pc.Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA), said: “Whilst we are cautious about the macro-economic environment, we will continue to invest to grow the region this year. We plan to open over 100 new stores in the UK and 300 new stores in EMEA, to continue this growth momentum.”New stores will be a mixture of company-owned branches and franchised stores.

Findings show that while family support remains paramount for almost half of Gen Z consumers, their entrepreneurial spirit cannot be underestimated, as more than one in 10 cite supporting their business as the primary reason for international money transfers.The study, which surveyed over 1,500 money-sending and receiving citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia, asked how, when and why they move money internationally. The results bolster Western Union’s recently announced ‘Evolve 2025’ (E25) strategy combining high-value, accessible digital and retail financial services.Gen Z survey-takers also reveal valuable insight into their decision-making habits for international money transfer brands, demonstrating the importance of convenience, speed and affordability. Results show that achieving the best exchange rate/transaction fee, speed of transfers and ensuring their receivers pay the lowest or no charges when collecting funds are the top three most influential factors (15% each). The survey also indicates that Gen Z seek flexibility in transfer methods in future, be it in cash or digital transactions.""Gen Z’s rising economic power is paving the way to a shift in how societies operate,"" said Jean Claude Farah, President of Middle East and Asia Pacific at Western Union. ""These findings reinforce Gen Z’s strong sense of responsibility and independent spirit – values that the Kingdom proactively seeks to nurture through its Vision 2030 blueprint. As a fintech pioneer, Western Union has championed a world of money movement that is unrestricted by geographical borders and driven by inclusivity for over 170 years. It is our responsibility as financial services providers to build an environment that enables safe and seamless money transfers. By doing so, we can help unlock opportunities for young entrepreneurs as they shape the future of tomorrow.""Story continuesChoice leads the way as Gen Z look to the futureExclusive insights announced previously by Western Union showed that almost 60% of Saudi Arabia’s consumers currently prefer using digital platforms to send international money transfers. When asked about the future, 47% said these experiences should remain digital, while 44% call for having more choice in platforms. Being empowered to choose how to remit trumps all for Gen Z, who lead the way with this view amongst all age groups at 47% as they consider their money movement needs in the future.""Gen Z have continually demonstrated their appetite for improved access, trust and flexibility when it comes to transferring funds internationally,"" Farah said. ""At Western Union, our omni-channel approach means we’re eliminating the barriers between physical and digital, offering more choice and empowering consumers to move money in the way they want, at the time they want.""About Western UnionThe Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) is committed to helping people around the world who aspire to build financial futures for themselves, their loved ones and their communities.

Luffy, a young pirate with a heart of gold, the world's bestselling manga series has already been adapted into an anime TV series with over 900 episodes. There are also 13 animated movies, “One Piece” video games and merchandise galore.Ready to give her verdict is Nina Oiki, a gender and politics researcher at Tokyo’s Waseda University who has been a “One Piece” fan since she was in elementary school. She read the manga created by Eiichiro Oda when it first came out in Shonen Jump magazine in 1997, and watched the animated show that followed shortly after.“I know some people are worried about what might happen with the Hollywood remake,” she said, noting how past American attempts at depicting Japanese comics and animated works have at times proved disappointing.The 2017 Netflix movie adaptation of “Death Note,” a manga and anime about a book that can kill people, was widely critiqued as a flop. In December 2021, Netflix canceled “Cowboy Bebop,” its live-action adaptation of the space Western manga and anime of the same name, after just one season.The cross-pollination of Hollywood and Japan goes back for decades. References to Japan, such as the image of a geisha on a screen, are plentiful in the 1982 sci-fi movie “Blade Runner,” directed by Ridley Scott.The film, in turn, influenced anime, including the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” anime that first aired in 2021.Japanese pop culture expert Roland Kelts says it’s a “stunning moment for anime,” in part due to streaming on platforms like Netflix, which has helped make entertainment borderless.Live-action “One Piece,” expected later this year, comes on the heels of the global success of “Demon Slayer,” another manga that got its start in Shonen Jump and was adapted into a movie and an anime series that was picked up by Netflix.Story continuesIn February, The Pokémon Company announced “Pokémon Concierge,” a stop-motion anime collaboration with Netflix. Pokémon is the world’s most valuable media franchise with estimated all-time sales of $100 billion, according to a 2021 Statista report. Followed by Hello Kitty, the two Japanese products outrank Western offerings like Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Star Wars. Hollywood live-action adaptations of other popular Japanese products — from Makoto Shinkai's 2016 body-swap anime “Your Name” to the “Gundam” franchise of giant robots that started in 1979 — are also in progress.Anime has a low production cost compared to live-action films, and computer-generated heroes don’t get sick or injured or make offensive remarks offscreen like real-life actors sometimes do, making it a marketable medium, said Kelts, author of “Japanamerica,” which documents Japanese pop culture's influence in the United States.“They are stylized and stateless characters. What I mean by that is that anime characters travel globally very, very well,” Kelts said. “The human celebrities don’t always travel so well.""Established bestsellers offer the advantage of a built-in fanbase, but they also come with strict scrutiny. Some, like “Ghost in the Shell,” have been criticized for “whitewashing” the Asian original. The 1995 animated movie was made into a Hollywood live-action in 2017 amid complaints about casting white American actor Scarlett Johansson as the main character — though Asia largely stayed out of the debate.Live-action “One Piece” will star Mexican actor Iñaki Godoy (""The Imperfects"") as Luffy — whose nationality is canonically a mystery — alongside American actor Emily Rudd (“The Romanoffs”) as Nami and Japanese-American actor Mackenyu (“Fullmetal Alchemist: Revenge of Scar,” “Fullmetal Alchemist: Final Transmutation”) as Roronoa Zoro.The main character’s inclusive persona, drawing more and more companions to join his quest throughout the story, highlights the kind of school, office or workplace environment people crave in modern-day society, fan Oiki said.“Luffy is that leader we all want,” she said. “Luffy is a hero but not an extraordinary hero. He is one of us. He wants to be king of the pirates, but not so he can rule, but so everyone can be free.""___Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama]"

Revenue in the fourth quarter was $724.7 million, versus Wall Street’s consensus prediction of $704 million. It was much better than a year ago when ENPH posted revenue of just $412.7 million.Clearly, the global push to go green isn’t going to go away.

The Ireland-based company has a market capitalization of more than $25 billion and has a solid drug pipeline to treat thyroid eye disease, inflammatory diseases, gout and rare disorders.Its best-selling drug is Tepezza, which is approved in the U.S. to treat eye bulging and double vision and generated more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market.That got a lot of attention, so not surprisingly, Horizon is in play. Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) announced in December that it planned to purchase Horizon in a $26.4 billion deal.HZNP stock is up 80% in the last six months, largely due to sale rumors that were finally confirmed in December with Amgen’s announcement. If and when the sale goes through, HZNP shareholders would get $116.50 per share in the all-cash deal – so there’s still some room to buy Horizon now and lock in those gains.HZNP stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Amgen (AMGN)Source: ShutterstockEven without the Horizon deal, I like Amgen as a solid buy and an excellent dividend stock. The California-based company has a strong pipeline of drugs on its own, including treatments for bone cancer, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.And if you are bargain shopping, then AMGN is looking really interesting here. The stock is down 10% so far in 2023 following a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report that saw year-over-year revenue slip by nearly 1%.But there’s still a lot to like here.

It just missed in ski jumping, taking three silver and two bronze medals.In Alpine skiing, Norway won the most medals outright at a world championships for the first time in history.In biathlon, Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Boe nearly became the first person to sweep all four individual gold medals at a world championships. He won three golds and a bronze. Add in relays, and he earned five gold medals, a silver and a bronze in the seven events at worlds, plus a road sign in his name.In cross-country skiing, Norway won all six men’s gold medals at worlds and all four individual men’s silver medals, its most dominant showing ever in men’s races in that sport.Freestyle skiing and snowboarding hold their world championships together. This was the second time in history that Norway won a gold medal in each discipline in one year — Marcus Kleveland in snowboard slopestyle and Birk Ruud in ski slopestyle. Norway’s seven total medals at freestyle and snowboard worlds were its most ever.Norway was at its best in Nordic combined, winning all five gold medals (three men’s events, one women’s event and one mixed-gender event). Nordic combined is the lone Olympic sport with no female representation at the Winter Games.On ice, Ragne Wiklund earned one gold and two silver at speed skating worlds, marking the best-ever performance for a Norwegian woman at those championships that date to 1996. Wiklund, still just 22, is Norway’s most accomplished female speed skater since World War II.Story continuesThere are more Winter Olympic medal events than ever, so it’s hardly a surprise that Norway, the most successful Winter Olympic nation in history, is breaking medal records (especially with Russia, a traditional rival in biathlon and cross-country skiing, absent).Other nations can take solace in knowing that a new snow sport debuts at the 2026 Winter Games: ski mountaineering.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today March 3, 2023 at 8:00 a.m. Mountain Time. I will now turn the conference over to Kim Perry, Gold Research Corporation, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.Kim Perry: Thank you, Julie. And good morning, everyone. On behalf of Gold Resource team, I would like to welcome you to our conference call covering our full-year 2022 results. Before we begin the call, there are a couple of housekeeping matters, I would like to address. Please note that certain statements to be made today are forward-looking in nature, and as such are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. All financial measures are unaudited. Audited financial statements will be presented in our 2022 Form 10-K, which will be filed at a future date, but no later than March 15. Once our audit firm completes their audit procedures. Please note all amounts referenced during this presentation are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.Joining me on the call today is Allen Palmiere, our President and CEO; and Alberto Reyes, our Chief Operating Officer. Following Allen, Alberto and my prepared remarks, we will be available to answer questions. This conference call is being webcast. For those of you joining us on the webcast, you can download a PDF copy of the conference call slides. The event will also be available for replay on our website later today. Yesterday's news release issued following the close of the market and the accompanying updated technical summary report have been filed with the SEC and EDGAR, and are also available on our website at www.goldresourcecorp.com. I will now turn the call over to Allen.Story continuesAllen Palmiere: Thank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank the listeners for taking the time to join us on this call. While we exceeded production guidance in 2022, the expected production results for 2023 are expected to decline approximately 25%, driven almost entirely by grade. The forecast for 2023, while generating cash flow sufficient to (ph) our capital needs in Mexico and cover our anticipated expenditures elsewhere is tight. We took a very difficult decision to pause the dividend to protect our debt free balance sheet. Admittedly, it is a conservative stance, but we are strongly in the belief the best way to create long-term value is to preserve our cash to ensure that we can unlock the value in the Don David Gold Mine.Our values underscore transparency and as such we strive to ensure we keep our investment community fully apprised of information as soon as it is available. Later in the call, Kim will share more details about our 2023 guidance. We are focused on improving our cash flow through productivity improvements; assessing our level of staffing and hopefully through exploration success, which will be discussed in just a moment. A little teaser for the readers, we will publish our inaugural ESG report next week, which highlights the many ESG programs aimed at not only compliance, but also at maintaining our social license to operate by being a good neighbor to our host communities and steward of the environment. After an update on our Don David Gold operations by Alberto and prepared remarks by Kim on our financials, I'd like to provide an update on our Back Forty Project.Lastly, we'll provide a few closing remarks and then we'll take questions from participants. Now please turn to slide four and I'll provide an update on our Q4 exploration results. Our number one priority is to continue to fund the capital programs at DDGM, including our infill and expansion exploration programs in Mexico. These programs have only been constrained by available drill sites and this remains true this year. We have never withheld capital for drilling. Unfortunately, we encountered delays in our exploration development during 2022, which resulted in being approximately six months behind in our drilling program. These delays involved ventilation and ground support and as they impacted working conditions and the safety of our employees that were not something that could be ignored and resulted in a delay.Gold, Ore, ExcavationPhoto by wilhelm gunkel on UnsplashThe technical issue is resolved in the fourth quarter and we're currently drilling in the highly prospective areas to the Southeast of Switchback, the Three Sisters and the Merino target parallel to the Arista vein system. As you will have seen from our press release on Tuesday, the initial results are very encouraging and give us confidence in the potential for additional high-grade results. While it takes time to develop a resource from initial drilling, we're excited about the future and it's our objective to increase our resources and reserves this year through exploration and infill drilling programs. On slide five, you can see that our commitment to exploration spending since 2021 has been significant. While 2023 appears to decline from 2022, this is largely due to the development work I mentioned earlier, largely conducted in 2022.We are now in a position with drill stations and drilling has commenced. We will still have additional development requirements in 2023. However, they are not as significant as 2022. As you can see from the graph, the significant spend in 2023 relates to underground exploration, expansion, and infill drilling. Turning to slide six, we are confident in the long-term DDGM as you will see in the updated technical summary report filed yesterday with our 8-K. In the 12/31/2022 resource model, excluding inferred material and not including the recent drill results, represents more than a six-year mine life. We are able to replace 88% of our resources by performing infill drilling, a comprehensive view of our geological database and interpretation of the mineralization and the block bottles derived from them.On slide seven, you'll see that we were able to replace reserves to the extent of 74%. The largest contributing factors of 26% decline was the depletion of the reserves by 0.5 million tons relating to 2022 mining activities offset by additions, due to the reclassification of measured and indicated material mineral resources to proven and probable reserves as a result of detailed engineering. I'll now pass the presentation over to Alberto to discuss the Don David Gold's full-year operational results.Alberto Reyes: Thank you, Allen, and also good morning to all. Turning with operational health and safety, I am pleased to report the significant progress the operations team has made in cultivating a mature safety culture. The team has surpassed its quota on leading indicators. And the results are reflected in an increased number of reports, while accidents and incidents continue to trend down. I am proud of the team for actively participating in identifying and correcting hazards in the workplace, while partaking in campaigns, communities and the type of leadership that reinforces safety. The results and safety stats for 2023 have been impressive so far. And I'm confident that the team will continue improving the safety culture.Regarding the operations, the team was able to achieve production targets despite the ground support needed during the construction of the ventilation rates between levels 22 and 27. Moreover, the completion of the last leg of the ventilation system has significantly improved working conditions, enabling the team to safely pursue new production targets and continuing exploration from drilling stations at the lower levels. Production increased quarter-over-quarter, the changes made to the sequence in Q4 gave access to the higher-grade material obtained from a section in the upper part of Northern Switchback that was only identified in 2022 through infill drilling. I am pleased to report that we processed nearly 0.5 million tons of ore and sold approximately 30,000 ounces of gold, 1 million ounces of silver, equating to a combined nearly 43,000 gold equivalent ounces.We further sold over 1,300 tons of copper approximately 5,000 tons of lead and more than 14,000 tons of zinc. Turning to slide nine. In 2022, our capital expenditure of $14.8 million paved the road for production in 2023. Some of the highlights include the completion of the gold regrind circuit, the dry stack facility and approximately 4,100 meters of development for exploration purposes, as well as for access to other mining levels. In other sustaining capital $3.2 million was invested and replacing some mining equipment, surface mine ventilation infrastructure and an electrical substation for the lower levels. This investment is aligned with the company's vision of sustainably growing Don David Gold Mine. I'll now pass over the presentation to Kim to discuss the financial results.Kim Perry: Thank you, Alberto. As previously noted, our 2022 Form 10-K will be filed in a few days once our audit firm have an opportunity to wrap up the audit. Therefore, all financial measures are unaudited. We closed the year with a strong balance sheet consisting of nearly $24 million in cash at December 31, 2022. Cash in 2022 decreased by $10 million, due to nearly $19 million in tax payments made for both 2021 and 2022, a $22 million investment in DDGM exploration and capital projects a nearly $9 million investment in the Back Forty Project and $1.7 million investment in Maritime Resources Corporation and nearly $4 million and dividends prior to suspension. For the full-year 2022, we reported net losses of $6.3 million.These losses are primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense and the Back Forty Project costs being reflected as an extent from the P&amp;L. The increase in depreciation expense reflects the addition of the filtration plant's, dry stock facilities and the addition of the Gold regrind circuit, offset by lower mineral reserve depreciation base. Net sales of nearly $140 million were 11% higher than the same period in 2021, due to both higher sales volumes and commodity prices for gold and zinc. Total production costs of approximately $81 million for the year or 12% higher in the production comps for the same period in 2021. The increase is largely related to increased cost across the board for the same period in 2021. Specifically, labor costs were higher due to both inflation and an increase in headcount as a result of a 2021 Mexican labor reform.However, in Q4 2022, we commenced the exercise of rightsizing our workforce for the future. Secondly, cost of materials consumed and transportation of concentrates were both higher due to inflation. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage this risk. As Alberto mentioned earlier, we incurred additional costs related to ground support and ventilation remediation that will also continue to benefit us in the future. Don David Gold Mines total cash costs after co-product credits was $458 per gold equivalent ounce sold, and total all in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce sold were $1,022 for the full-year. These costs were slightly higher than 2021 costs related to higher production costs just discussed. Moving on to slide 11, I'd like to discuss our 2023 guidance.The two headlines are the year-over-year reduction in gold equivalent ounces and the increase in cash cost and all in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce. The gold and silver production profile was primarily driven by expected decline in metal grades as Allen mentioned. However, as both Allen and Alberto mentioned, there are many productivity measures being taken to address this decline in both grade and the overall production profile. With regard to cash cost, you will notice significant from 2022. The unit cost increase is driven primarily by the decline in the gold equivalent ounces sold. As mentioned throughout this presentation, we are laser focused on improving operating cash flows. The 2023 guidance further demonstrates the commitment to continue investing both capital and filtration in Mexico.And a final note on G&amp;A was driven by the addition of highly skilled . I think Allen might be on mute.See also 11 Most Profitable Energy Stocks and 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Good Returns.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

All battery chemistries require copper, albeit to varying degrees. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, a burgeoning part of the EV market, need around 50% more copper than nickel-manganese-cobalt, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Outside of the battery pack copper is also used in the electric motor, the busbar and in what can be up to a mile of internal wiring.The amount of copper used in a typical battery electric vehicle is 83 kilograms, compared with just 23 kilograms in an internal combustion vehicle, according to the International Copper Association.FEAR OF FALLING SHORTStellantis' leap upstream in the copper processing chain follows similar deals with Germany's Vulcan Energy for lithium and Australia's Element 25 for manganese.The copper investment has the same strategic rationale, one of ""ensuring strategic supplies of raw materials necessary for the success of the Company's global electrification plans"", to quote Stellantis.Automakers' collective move into the mining sector has so far largely prioritised the lithium sector, where Western companies have been playing catch-up with Chinese investors.Lithium supply is struggling to scale up at the speed required to meet accelerating demand from battery-makers. Even with a recent pullback in the spot Chinese market, the price of lithium carbonate has risen seven-fold since the start of 2021.Where lithium is today, copper could be tomorrow, if you believe Glencore, which has warned of a cumulative shortfall of 50 million tonnes by 2030 under the IEA's net zero emissions pathway.Imminent shortfall has been part and parcel of the copper narrative for many years, largely due to poor visibility on future project time-lines.However, this time could be different given the sector's chronic under-investment in new mine capacity. Producers have been collectively scarred by the experience of the 2000s, when they spent heavily on new mines only to see the copper price slide steadily lower over the first half of the 2010s.Capital expenditure in the sector slumped, miners opting to return cash to shareholders rather than dig more big copper mines. It hasn't recovered despite the pick-up in the copper price from a cycle low of $4,318 per tonne in 2016 to $9,000.Current guidance ""points toward 34% less growth capex deployed in nominal terms between 2022-2026 than was deployed over the same time frame during the early-mid 2000's,"" according to Goldman Sachs. (""Copper: The end of surplus"", Dec. 6, 2022).If copper producers remain too wary of investing in future supply growth, automotive capital may be the answer. It is already a key enabler in the build-out of lithium, nickel and manganese production capacity.BACK TO THE FUTUREThe automotive sector is driving back to the future, the new rush to take control of supply chains an echo of Henry Ford, who famously bought iron and steel operations to supply the iconic River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's ambition to own the full automotive supply chain from mine to product was driven by the raw material shortages created by the first world war.The company's modern-day successors are faced with the same raw materials shortfall across the battery metals spectrum. If they could have sourced their metals using their favoured horizontal supply chain model, they would have done.But so intense is the competition for battery metals and so entrenched the dominant Chinese operators that Western automotive companies have little choice but to invest directly in the next generation of supply projects.However, the move upstream comes with plenty of potential pitfalls.Greenfield mines have a history of running late and over budget, particularly when they are experimenting with new processing technology such as is being deployed at many lithium projects.It's worth remembering that Henry Ford's vertical integration model wasn't always successful.The Brazilian rubber plantations, intended to supply latex for tire production, were plagued by poor yields and bad relations with the local workforce. It didn't help that Ford initially insisted on a Midwestern diet and participation in events such as square-dancing.However, even after the rules were relaxed and the operations transferred to a more promising site, Ford's Brazilian dreams were overtaken by the invention of synthetic rubber.Ford ended up selling the assets back to the Brazilian government for just $250,000 without having achieved a commercially viable operation.It's a useful reminder that going upstream can be a high-risk business for even the biggest automotive companies.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today March 3, 2023 at 8:00 a.m. Mountain Time. I will now turn the conference over to Kim Perry, Gold Research Corporation, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.Kim Perry: Thank you, Julie. And good morning, everyone. On behalf of Gold Resource team, I would like to welcome you to our conference call covering our full-year 2022 results. Before we begin the call, there are a couple of housekeeping matters, I would like to address. Please note that certain statements to be made today are forward-looking in nature, and as such are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. All financial measures are unaudited. Audited financial statements will be presented in our 2022 Form 10-K, which will be filed at a future date, but no later than March 15. Once our audit firm completes their audit procedures. Please note all amounts referenced during this presentation are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.Joining me on the call today is Allen Palmiere, our President and CEO; and Alberto Reyes, our Chief Operating Officer. Following Allen, Alberto and my prepared remarks, we will be available to answer questions. This conference call is being webcast. For those of you joining us on the webcast, you can download a PDF copy of the conference call slides. The event will also be available for replay on our website later today. Yesterday's news release issued following the close of the market and the accompanying updated technical summary report have been filed with the SEC and EDGAR, and are also available on our website at www.goldresourcecorp.com. I will now turn the call over to Allen.Story continuesAllen Palmiere: Thank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank the listeners for taking the time to join us on this call. While we exceeded production guidance in 2022, the expected production results for 2023 are expected to decline approximately 25%, driven almost entirely by grade. The forecast for 2023, while generating cash flow sufficient to (ph) our capital needs in Mexico and cover our anticipated expenditures elsewhere is tight. We took a very difficult decision to pause the dividend to protect our debt free balance sheet. Admittedly, it is a conservative stance, but we are strongly in the belief the best way to create long-term value is to preserve our cash to ensure that we can unlock the value in the Don David Gold Mine.Our values underscore transparency and as such we strive to ensure we keep our investment community fully apprised of information as soon as it is available. Later in the call, Kim will share more details about our 2023 guidance. We are focused on improving our cash flow through productivity improvements; assessing our level of staffing and hopefully through exploration success, which will be discussed in just a moment. A little teaser for the readers, we will publish our inaugural ESG report next week, which highlights the many ESG programs aimed at not only compliance, but also at maintaining our social license to operate by being a good neighbor to our host communities and steward of the environment. After an update on our Don David Gold operations by Alberto and prepared remarks by Kim on our financials, I'd like to provide an update on our Back Forty Project.Lastly, we'll provide a few closing remarks and then we'll take questions from participants. Now please turn to slide four and I'll provide an update on our Q4 exploration results. Our number one priority is to continue to fund the capital programs at DDGM, including our infill and expansion exploration programs in Mexico. These programs have only been constrained by available drill sites and this remains true this year. We have never withheld capital for drilling. Unfortunately, we encountered delays in our exploration development during 2022, which resulted in being approximately six months behind in our drilling program. These delays involved ventilation and ground support and as they impacted working conditions and the safety of our employees that were not something that could be ignored and resulted in a delay.Gold, Ore, ExcavationPhoto by wilhelm gunkel on UnsplashThe technical issue is resolved in the fourth quarter and we're currently drilling in the highly prospective areas to the Southeast of Switchback, the Three Sisters and the Merino target parallel to the Arista vein system. As you will have seen from our press release on Tuesday, the initial results are very encouraging and give us confidence in the potential for additional high-grade results. While it takes time to develop a resource from initial drilling, we're excited about the future and it's our objective to increase our resources and reserves this year through exploration and infill drilling programs. On slide five, you can see that our commitment to exploration spending since 2021 has been significant. While 2023 appears to decline from 2022, this is largely due to the development work I mentioned earlier, largely conducted in 2022.We are now in a position with drill stations and drilling has commenced. We will still have additional development requirements in 2023. However, they are not as significant as 2022. As you can see from the graph, the significant spend in 2023 relates to underground exploration, expansion, and infill drilling. Turning to slide six, we are confident in the long-term DDGM as you will see in the updated technical summary report filed yesterday with our 8-K. In the 12/31/2022 resource model, excluding inferred material and not including the recent drill results, represents more than a six-year mine life. We are able to replace 88% of our resources by performing infill drilling, a comprehensive view of our geological database and interpretation of the mineralization and the block bottles derived from them.On slide seven, you'll see that we were able to replace reserves to the extent of 74%. The largest contributing factors of 26% decline was the depletion of the reserves by 0.5 million tons relating to 2022 mining activities offset by additions, due to the reclassification of measured and indicated material mineral resources to proven and probable reserves as a result of detailed engineering. I'll now pass the presentation over to Alberto to discuss the Don David Gold's full-year operational results.Alberto Reyes: Thank you, Allen, and also good morning to all. Turning with operational health and safety, I am pleased to report the significant progress the operations team has made in cultivating a mature safety culture. The team has surpassed its quota on leading indicators. And the results are reflected in an increased number of reports, while accidents and incidents continue to trend down. I am proud of the team for actively participating in identifying and correcting hazards in the workplace, while partaking in campaigns, communities and the type of leadership that reinforces safety. The results and safety stats for 2023 have been impressive so far. And I'm confident that the team will continue improving the safety culture.Regarding the operations, the team was able to achieve production targets despite the ground support needed during the construction of the ventilation rates between levels 22 and 27. Moreover, the completion of the last leg of the ventilation system has significantly improved working conditions, enabling the team to safely pursue new production targets and continuing exploration from drilling stations at the lower levels. Production increased quarter-over-quarter, the changes made to the sequence in Q4 gave access to the higher-grade material obtained from a section in the upper part of Northern Switchback that was only identified in 2022 through infill drilling. I am pleased to report that we processed nearly 0.5 million tons of ore and sold approximately 30,000 ounces of gold, 1 million ounces of silver, equating to a combined nearly 43,000 gold equivalent ounces.We further sold over 1,300 tons of copper approximately 5,000 tons of lead and more than 14,000 tons of zinc. Turning to slide nine. In 2022, our capital expenditure of $14.8 million paved the road for production in 2023. Some of the highlights include the completion of the gold regrind circuit, the dry stack facility and approximately 4,100 meters of development for exploration purposes, as well as for access to other mining levels. In other sustaining capital $3.2 million was invested and replacing some mining equipment, surface mine ventilation infrastructure and an electrical substation for the lower levels. This investment is aligned with the company's vision of sustainably growing Don David Gold Mine. I'll now pass over the presentation to Kim to discuss the financial results.Kim Perry: Thank you, Alberto. As previously noted, our 2022 Form 10-K will be filed in a few days once our audit firm have an opportunity to wrap up the audit. Therefore, all financial measures are unaudited. We closed the year with a strong balance sheet consisting of nearly $24 million in cash at December 31, 2022. Cash in 2022 decreased by $10 million, due to nearly $19 million in tax payments made for both 2021 and 2022, a $22 million investment in DDGM exploration and capital projects a nearly $9 million investment in the Back Forty Project and $1.7 million investment in Maritime Resources Corporation and nearly $4 million and dividends prior to suspension. For the full-year 2022, we reported net losses of $6.3 million.These losses are primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense and the Back Forty Project costs being reflected as an extent from the P&amp;L. The increase in depreciation expense reflects the addition of the filtration plant's, dry stock facilities and the addition of the Gold regrind circuit, offset by lower mineral reserve depreciation base. Net sales of nearly $140 million were 11% higher than the same period in 2021, due to both higher sales volumes and commodity prices for gold and zinc. Total production costs of approximately $81 million for the year or 12% higher in the production comps for the same period in 2021. The increase is largely related to increased cost across the board for the same period in 2021. Specifically, labor costs were higher due to both inflation and an increase in headcount as a result of a 2021 Mexican labor reform.However, in Q4 2022, we commenced the exercise of rightsizing our workforce for the future. Secondly, cost of materials consumed and transportation of concentrates were both higher due to inflation. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage this risk. As Alberto mentioned earlier, we incurred additional costs related to ground support and ventilation remediation that will also continue to benefit us in the future. Don David Gold Mines total cash costs after co-product credits was $458 per gold equivalent ounce sold, and total all in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce sold were $1,022 for the full-year. These costs were slightly higher than 2021 costs related to higher production costs just discussed. Moving on to slide 11, I'd like to discuss our 2023 guidance.The two headlines are the year-over-year reduction in gold equivalent ounces and the increase in cash cost and all in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce. The gold and silver production profile was primarily driven by expected decline in metal grades as Allen mentioned. However, as both Allen and Alberto mentioned, there are many productivity measures being taken to address this decline in both grade and the overall production profile. With regard to cash cost, you will notice significant from 2022. The unit cost increase is driven primarily by the decline in the gold equivalent ounces sold. As mentioned throughout this presentation, we are laser focused on improving operating cash flows. The 2023 guidance further demonstrates the commitment to continue investing both capital and filtration in Mexico.And a final note on G&amp;A was driven by the addition of highly skilled . I think Allen might be on mute.See also 11 Most Profitable Energy Stocks and 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Good Returns.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

But the 2023 targets underlying that stance will disappoint bulls hoping for more ambitious support as the economy reopens.Although Beijing promised increased state spending and a wider budget deficit, the headline GDP growth figure of around 5% is at the low end of expectations. The target for local government bond sales — the backbone of infrastructure investment that drives much of China’s raw materials demand — was modest too, suggesting the government is seeking to strike a balance between supporting the economy and strained finances, plus the need to prevent runaway commodities inflation.None of the official documents released on Sunday suggested appetite for the kind of massive boost deployed to right the economy after the financial crisis or even at the beginning of the pandemic, when Beijing drove markets for materials like copper and iron ore to record highs in 2021, forcing authorities to intervene.There was some solace to be found in the rhetoric around China’s need to increase consumption — good news for commodities that benefit from consumer spending, including oil and agricultural products — but there were few concrete measures to point to. The central bank has also reiterated that it won’t roll out excessive stimulus, relying instead on consumer confidence and investment to improve as the economy strengthens.Story continuesWhat are the priorities for commodities markets?China’s anxieties over its reliance on overseas suppliers to feed its vast population and supply the raw materials it needs are never far from the forefront of government policy, but the combination of Covid disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine placed both toward the top of the list of this year’s concerns.Some of extra spending will be deployed on projects to enhance energy and food security, including an increase in the country’s capacity to produce grain. The government also wants to bolster the domestic supply of materials like iron ore, for the steel industry, and lithium, for electric vehicle batteries, which are deemed crucial to promoting self-sufficiency.Beijing will maintain tight price controls on energy and agricultural commodities to help meet this year’s 3% consumer inflation target, the top economic planning agency’s vice chairman told a briefing on Monday. And it will continue to expand domestic oil and gas output to avoid becoming too dependent on foreign sources.Raising defense spending has also emerged as a top priority, and while procurement is likely to be highly secretive, it could lift demand for rare earths and other metals used in weaponry.How did environmental and climate policies fare?Environmental targets included a small drop in energy intensity for the year — about 2% — and a pledge to control fossil fuel consumption, although that message was muddied by the shout-out for the role played by coal as the country’s mainstay fuel.Stung by widespread power outages in recent years, the government has pushed production of the dirtiest fossil fuel to record levels. Output rose 10% last year to 4.5 billion tons, while natural gas also hit an all-time high and crude oil rose above 200 million tons for the first time since 2015, helping to cut China’s reliance on pricey energy imports.Breakneck expansion is testing miners’ limits and concerns over safety are once again in the news after a deadly mine collapse in northern China last month cast a spotlight on the dangers inherent in the country’s effort to prioritize energy security by boosting coal production.The government will push ahead with its plans for massive solar and wind projects based inland, and with power grids upgrades. Cracking down on carbon data fraud will also be a priority as the authorities work to strengthen the nation’s ailing emissions trading system ahead of a planned expansion.What about the outlook for property and infrastructure?Local governments will be allowed to sell 3.8 trillion yuan ($550 billion) of new special bonds, which are mainly used to fund infrastructure spending. That’s more than the 3.65 trillion yuan set at last year’s meeting, but lower than actual issuance of 4.04 trillion yuan in 2022. Bloomberg Economics calculates the government’s spending plans translate into a broad budget deficit, including local government bonds, of 5.9%, compared to 5.8% of GDP in 2022 — higher than it expected.Infrastructure accounts for the biggest chunk of China’s steel consumption, so that sector in particular will benefit from more public works to buttress the economy’s recovery and to alleviate the crisis in the real estate industry.But the type of investment is changing as spending turns from the old economy to the new. That means more solar farms, power storage facilities and expansions of the grid, perhaps using less steel and cement but requiring more materials like copper and aluminum that are critical to the energy transition.The government’s support for the embattled property market, for example, which accounts for almost one-third of Chinese steel demand and as much as one-fifth of appetite for base metals such as copper, aluminum, and zinc, was equivocal. Premier Li Keqiang said China needs to prevent a disorderly expansion of the sector, as policy makers seek to pull a crucial economic growth lever without piling on financial risks.Sunday’s plans suggest Beijing isn’t quite content to let the economy motor along under its own steam after an unexpectedly robust revival in factory activity in February.

43,46a8e8b3-5f2d-3a08-9521-161a34c0b8d0,MA,2023-03-06,RPT-COLUMN-Automakers rush in where miners fear to tread: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-column-automakers-rush-where-010000998.html,1678064400,STORY,"['HG=F', 'LAC', 'GM']","[(Repeats Friday's column with no changes to text)By Andy HomeLONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The race for electric vehicle (EV) battery metals is heating up.Automakers can't go green without having sufficient quantities of the lithium, nickel and cobalt that make the batteries work.Fear of missing out, quite literally, is generating an industry-wide shift to investing directly in the mining sector to ensure future supplies of the battery inputs.General Motors Co has announced a $650-million investment in Lithium Americas Corp to help fund development of the Thacker Pass project in Nevada.GM gets exclusive rights to 40,000 tonnes per year of lithium from a domestic mine, which is key to qualifying for the EV subsidies available under the Inflation Reduction Act.Carmakers have already been busy tying up supplies of battery metals under direct off-take agreements with existing metals producers.Now they are getting into the business of actually digging the mines, or at least helping with the finance.The investment rush has until now largely played out in the lithium sector but French-Italian carmaker Stellantis has just pivoted into copper with an investment in an Argentinian project.COPPER PIVOTStellantis, the third largest automotive group by sales, will pay $155 million for a 14.2% stake in McEwen Copper, a subsidiary of Canada's McEwen Mining, which owns the Los Azules project in Argentina.The deposit, ranked in the top 10 global undeveloped copper resources by Mining Intelligence, is expected to yield 100,000 tonnes per year of refined cathode from its anticipated start date in 2027.The automaker's investment comes with an option to purchase the mine's output at a ratio equivalent to its equity ownership.With the help of existing shareholder Nuton, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, and its copper leaching technology, McEwen is aiming to make the mine carbon-neutral by 2038, adding to the project's green credentials.Story continuesCopper is an often forgotten component of EV batteries, but it plays a critical role as a current collector. All battery chemistries require copper, albeit to varying degrees. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, a burgeoning part of the EV market, need around 50% more copper than nickel-manganese-cobalt, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Outside of the battery pack copper is also used in the electric motor, the busbar and in what can be up to a mile of internal wiring.The amount of copper used in a typical battery electric vehicle is 83 kilograms, compared with just 23 kilograms in an internal combustion vehicle, according to the International Copper Association.FEAR OF FALLING SHORTStellantis' leap upstream in the copper processing chain follows similar deals with Germany's Vulcan Energy for lithium and Australia's Element 25 for manganese.The copper investment has the same strategic rationale, one of ""ensuring strategic supplies of raw materials necessary for the success of the Company's global electrification plans"", to quote Stellantis.Automakers' collective move into the mining sector has so far largely prioritised the lithium sector, where Western companies have been playing catch-up with Chinese investors.Lithium supply is struggling to scale up at the speed required to meet accelerating demand from battery-makers. Even with a recent pullback in the spot Chinese market, the price of lithium carbonate has risen seven-fold since the start of 2021.Where lithium is today, copper could be tomorrow, if you believe Glencore, which has warned of a cumulative shortfall of 50 million tonnes by 2030 under the IEA's net zero emissions pathway.Imminent shortfall has been part and parcel of the copper narrative for many years, largely due to poor visibility on future project time-lines.However, this time could be different given the sector's chronic under-investment in new mine capacity. Producers have been collectively scarred by the experience of the 2000s, when they spent heavily on new mines only to see the copper price slide steadily lower over the first half of the 2010s.Capital expenditure in the sector slumped, miners opting to return cash to shareholders rather than dig more big copper mines. It hasn't recovered despite the pick-up in the copper price from a cycle low of $4,318 per tonne in 2016 to $9,000.Current guidance ""points toward 34% less growth capex deployed in nominal terms between 2022-2026 than was deployed over the same time frame during the early-mid 2000's,"" according to Goldman Sachs. (""Copper: The end of surplus"", Dec. 6, 2022).If copper producers remain too wary of investing in future supply growth, automotive capital may be the answer. It is already a key enabler in the build-out of lithium, nickel and manganese production capacity.BACK TO THE FUTUREThe automotive sector is driving back to the future, the new rush to take control of supply chains an echo of Henry Ford, who famously bought iron and steel operations to supply the iconic River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's ambition to own the full automotive supply chain from mine to product was driven by the raw material shortages created by the first world war.The company's modern-day successors are faced with the same raw materials shortfall across the battery metals spectrum. If they could have sourced their metals using their favoured horizontal supply chain model, they would have done.But so intense is the competition for battery metals and so entrenched the dominant Chinese operators that Western automotive companies have little choice but to invest directly in the next generation of supply projects.However, the move upstream comes with plenty of potential pitfalls.Greenfield mines have a history of running late and over budget, particularly when they are experimenting with new processing technology such as is being deployed at many lithium projects.It's worth remembering that Henry Ford's vertical integration model wasn't always successful.The Brazilian rubber plantations, intended to supply latex for tire production, were plagued by poor yields and bad relations with the local workforce. It didn't help that Ford initially insisted on a Midwestern diet and participation in events such as square-dancing.However, even after the rules were relaxed and the operations transferred to a more promising site, Ford's Brazilian dreams were overtaken by the invention of synthetic rubber.Ford ended up selling the assets back to the Brazilian government for just $250,000 without having achieved a commercially viable operation.It's a useful reminder that going upstream can be a high-risk business for even the biggest automotive companies.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

Companies that have a track record of increasing their dividend for many years, with lower volatility, are generally known as blue-chip stocks.At the same time, above-average returns are highly sought after, as that allows investors to grow their wealth faster. Retirees might benefit from a higher living standard when their investment portfolios are generating strong returns.In this article, we will showcase three companies that fit both lists. These three blue-chip stocks are also reliable dividend growth stocks with solid track records. Their total return outlook over the coming years is also better than that of the average stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBank of Nova Scotia (BNS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) is a major Canadian bank that belongs to the country’s “Big 4.” It trades on the New York Stock Exchange as well as on Canadian exchanges. The bank is primarily active in Canada but also operates in some foreign countries. This incudes the U.S., Mexico, some countries in Central and South America, and the Caribbean.It offers a wide range of typical banking and financial services to its customers, including debit and credit cards, saving accounts, mortgages, loans, insurance, business lending, brokerage services, investment banking services such as advisory and capital markets services, and so on.Due to headwinds for its wealth management business from declining equity markets, its profits were down slightly during the most recent quarter. Nevertheless, the company managed to grow its earnings per share (EPS) to a record level in 2022 overall, as EPS hit $6.26.For the current year, another increase in profits looks likely. Rising interest rates should allow Bank of Nova Scotia to grow its net interest income, which should be more than enough to offset ongoing headwinds from tough equity and bond markets that negatively impact the bank’s wealth management business.Story continuesBank of Nova Scotia has increased its dividend for 11 years in a row, making it a Dividend Achiever. We believe that there is a high chance that the bank will continue to increase its dividend over time. Based on current EPS estimates for this year, Bank of Nova Scotia will pay out a little less than half its net profit this year via dividends. That means that the dividend is pretty safe and that there is considerable room for further dividend increases.With a dividend yield of 5.8%, forecasted longer-term EPS growth of 5% per year, and considerable multiple expansion potential, we believe that there is a high chance that Bank of Nova Scotia will deliver returns in the mid-teens range over the next five years.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor company that operates with a fabless model. That means it designs, develops and markets chips, but production is outsourced to foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).This fabless model means that Qualcomm does not have to invest large amounts of cash for capital expenditures, which results in a high free-cash-flow conversion. This, in turn, means that Qualcomm has more flexibility when it comes to shareholder returns and acquisitions.Qualcomm’s products consist of integrated circuits that are used in mobile devices to enable voice and data communication. Qualcomm also has a large patent portfolio that includes 3G, 4G and 5G tech. This generates high-margin royalty payments for the company that it can use for shareholder returns and investments in other areas.Despite the fact that chip markets have become weaker in the recent past, Qualcomm has reported very strong results. In its most recent quarter, the company was able to grow its revenue by 22% year over year.During fiscal 2023, however, Qualcomm may experience some headwinds from a weakening chip market and a potential recession. That is why EPS are forecasted to pull back this year. However, they will still be the second-highest ever, behind only the 2022 profit per share that set a new record.Qualcomm has increased its dividend for 20 years in a row. Additionally, there is a lot of room for further dividend growth, as the dividend payout ratio is below 30%. This makes the dividend very safe and should allow Qualcomm to offer sizeable dividend increases for many years to come.Between the dividend yield of 2.4%, forecasted EPS growth of 7%, and substantial tailwinds from multiple expansions, a mid-teens total return seems achievable.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a chemicals company that is the largest lithium producer in the world while also producing other products such as bromine. Lithium is used in many batteries. And battery demand has been growing for many years. They are used in smartphones and other mobile devices, but the largest growth driver recently has been electric vehicles (EVs).EVs require a large amount of lithium. And sales for EVs have been growing quickly, even though most vehicles sold around the world are combustion-powered. Growing demand for lithium from EVs and other products has led to a sharp increase in lithium prices. This has made Albemarle’s sales and profits surge upwards.During the most recent quarter, Albemarle generated sales of $2.1 billion. This was up by 150% year over year, thanks mostly to surging lithium revenues. Albemarle’s profits rose even faster in 2022 due to the impact of operating leverage. Additionally, it is forecasted that Albemarle will see its EPS hit an even higher level (and a new record) in 2023.Albemarle has increased its dividend by 27 years in a row, making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The dividend yield isn’t high, at only 0.6%. However, the dividend growth has been solid, as the company doubled its dividend over the last decade. The payout ratio is very low, at well below 10%. Thus, there is an extremely small dividend-cut risk.While the small dividend yield does not add a lot to Albemarle’s total return potential, the total return outlook over the coming five years is still strong. Between expected EPS growth of 7%-8% and sizeable multiple expansion tailwind potential, we believe that total returns could reach 15% per year.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Carefully evaluate the potential risk and benefit of vaccination in children with thrombocytopenia or in those who experienced thrombocytopenia after vaccination with a previous dose of a measles, mumps, and rubella-containing vaccine.Varicella Transmission and Precautions: Advise vaccinees administered ProQuad or VARIVAX to avoid: close contact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination since transmission of varicella vaccine virus to susceptible contacts has been reported. Varicella vaccine virus transmission may occur between vaccine recipients and contacts susceptible to varicella including healthy individuals.Immune Globulins and Transfusions: Immune Globulins and other blood products should not be given concomitantly with ProQuad, M-M-R®II, or VARIVAX.Use of Salicylates: Avoid use of salicylates in children and adolescents administered ProQuad or VARIVAX for 6 weeks following vaccination due to the association of Reye Syndrome with salicylate therapy and wild-type varicella infection.Adverse Events: The following adverse events have been reported for both subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of ProQuad, M-M-R®II, and VARIVAX: fever, injection-site reactions (pain/tenderness/soreness, erythema, and swelling); and rash on the body or at the injection site. Additionally, irritability has been reported for the subcutaneous injections of ProQuad, M-M-R®II, and VARIVAX.ProQuad Systemic Vaccine-Related Adverse Events: Systemic vaccine-related adverse events that were reported at a significantly greater rate in recipients of subcutaneous ProQuad than in recipients of the component vaccines administered concomitantly were fever and measles-like rash.VARIVAX Dose-related Adverse Events: In a clinical trial involving children who received 2 doses of VARIVAX 3 months apart, the incidence of injection-site clinical complaints observed in the first 4 days following vaccination was slightly higher post-dose 2 (overall incidence 25.4%) than post-dose 1 (overall incidence 21.7%), whereas the incidence of systemic clinical complaints in the 42-day follow-up period was lower post-dose 2 (66.3%) than post-dose 1 (85.8%).Concomitant Vaccines With ProQuad: ProQuad may be administered concomitantly with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine. It may also be administered concomitantly with pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine and/or hepatitis A vaccine (inactivated) at separate injection sites.Concomitant Vaccines With VARIVAX: VARIVAX can be administered with other live viral vaccines. If not given concurrently, at least 1 month should elapse between a dose of a live attenuated measles virus-containing vaccine and a dose of VARIVAX. In children, at least 3 months should elapse between administration of 2 doses of a live attenuated varicella virus-containing vaccine.Tuberculin Testing: If a tuberculin test is to be done with M-M-R®II and ProQuad, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination. With VARIVAX, tuberculin testing may be performed before the vaccine is administered or at least 4 weeks following vaccination.Additional M-M-R®II Precautions: Additional adverse reactions, which have been reported without regard to causality, include febrile convulsions, arthritis, thrombocytopenia, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, arthritis, encephalitis and encephalopathy in their diverse clinical presentations.Additional VARIVAX Precautions: It is not known if varicella vaccine virus is excreted in human milk. A boost in antibody levels has been observed in vaccinees following exposure to wild-type varicella, which could account for the apparent long-term persistence of antibody levels in studies. The duration of protection from varicella infection after vaccination is unknown.ProQuad/VARIVAX and Herpes Zoster: The long-term effect of VARIVAX on the incidence of herpes zoster, particularly in those vaccinees exposed to wild-type varicella, is unknown at present.Efficacy: Vaccination with ProQuad, VARIVAX, or M-M-R®II may not result in protection in 100% of vaccinees.Dosage and AdministrationProQuad:Each dose of ProQuad is approximately 0.5 mL and is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.At least 1 month should elapse between a dose of a measles-containing vaccine such as M-M-R®II and a dose of ProQuad. At least 3 months should elapse between a dose of varicella-containing vaccine and ProQuad.VARIVAX:Each dose is approximately 0.5 mL and is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.The first dose is administered at 12 to 15 months of age.The second dose is administered at 4 to 6 years of age.There should be a minimum interval of 3 months between doses.12 months to 12 years of age: If a second dose is administered, there should be a minimum interval of 3 months between doses.Adolescents (≥13 years of age) and Adults: 2 doses, to be administered with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses.M-M-R®II:The dose for any age is approximately 0.5 mL administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.The recommended age for primary vaccination is 12 to 15 months and the second dose should be given at 4 to 6 years of age.Before administrating VARIVAX® (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), M-M-R®II (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), or ProQuad® (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), please read the Prescribing Information.

But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. For example the V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) share price dropped 64% over five years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 49% in the last year. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 14% in thirty days. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. Check out our latest analysis for V.F To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, V.F actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 9.7% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for V.F in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of V.F, it has a TSR of -56% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that V.F shareholders are down 47% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.1%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand V.F better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for V.F   (of which 2 don't sit too well with us!) you should know about.V.F is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Microsoft may need to provide additional measures to address concerns raised by parties other than Sony (NYSE:SONY), in addition to offering licensing agreements to competitors. These measures typically relate to the way the merged company will behave in the future.Activision Blizzard shares rose more than 2% on Thursday following the report and closed the week with more than a 3% gain.Broadcom faces EU antitrust warning on VMware dealBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will soon receive an antitrust warning from the European Union regarding the potential anti-competitive impact of its $61B bid for VMware (NYSE:VMW), according to a Reuters report on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The warning is expected to be issued in the coming weeks.In December, the European Commission opened an investigation, stating that the deal would enable Broadcom to limit competition in the market for particular hardware components that interoperate with VMware's software.According to the sources, the commission will articulate its concerns in a statement of objections. Following this, companies can request a closed hearing to defend their deals in front of senior commission and national competition officials, as well as rivals and the commission's lawyers.Story continuesBroadcom is anticipated to propose remedies only after receiving the charge sheet from the EU and not beforehand, with no asset sale expected.While the acquisition has received the green light in Brazil, South Africa, and Canada, the U.K.'s competition watchdog is scrutinizing the deal.Both Broadcom and VMware climbed higher for the week - by 7.9% and 4.7%, respectively - on better-than-expected earnings.Pfizer in talks to acquire Seagen for over $30BPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is exploring the possibility of acquiring Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) in a deal that could exceed $30B, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Monday, which cited sources familiar with the matter.The talks are in their early stages, and the WSJ reported that there is no guarantee the acquisition will occur. Additionally, any potential transaction would likely require regulatory review and approval due to antitrust concerns.Last year, Seagen was in advanced acquisition discussions with Pfizer's rival Merck (NYSE:MRK), but the parties failed to reach a formal agreement.Seagen shares jumped 10% on Monday following the report and closed the week with more than a 12% gain.Apollo Global Management explores a takeout of ArconicArconic (NYSE:ARNC) shares jumped more than 19% on Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported that private equity firm Apollo Global Management is in talks to acquire the company, citing people familiar with the matter.

60,a4562352-6baf-32ae-a65e-80f85aa8e1b3,FOXA,2023-03-06,Fox libel defense at odds with top GOP presidential foes,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-libel-defense-odds-top-050801145.html,1678079281,STORY,['FOXA'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News is on an unlikely collision course with two leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination over the rights of journalists.In defending itself against a massive defamation lawsuit over how it covered false claims surrounding the 2020 presidential election, the network is relying on a nearly 60-year-old Supreme Court ruling that makes it difficult to successfully sue media organizations for libel.Former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, two favorites of many Fox News viewers, have advocated for the court to revisit the standard, which is considered the foundational case in American defamation law.“It is ironic that Fox is relying on a landmark case that was designed to help the news media play the watchdog role in a democracy and is under attack by Gov. DeSantis, Donald Trump and other figures who have been untethered in their attacks on journalists as enemies of the people,” said Jane Hall, a communication professor at American University.Eye-catching evidence has emerged from court filings in recent weeks revealing a split screen between what Fox was portraying to its viewers about the false claims of election fraud and what hosts and executives were saying about them behind the scenes. “Sydney Powell is lying,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson said in a text to a producer, referencing one of the attorneys pushing the claims for Trump.In an email a few weeks after the 2020 election, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch described a news conference featuring Powell and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another attorney who pushed the election lies: “Really crazy stuff. And damaging.”Aside from the revelations about Fox's inner workings, the outcome could have broad implications for media organizations because of how they and the courts have come to rely on the libel law Fox is using as a shield.In its $1.6 billion lawsuit, voting machine maker Dominion Voting Systems argues that Fox repeatedly aired allegations that the company helped rig the general election against Trump despite many at the news organization privately believing the claims were false.Story continuesFox says the law allows it to air such claims if they are newsworthy.In a 1964 decision in a case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court greatly limited the ability of public officials to sue for defamation. It ruled that news outlets are protected against a libel judgment unless it can be proven that they published with “actual malice” — knowing that something was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” to whether it was true or not.In one example of how the law was applied, editors at the Times acknowledged last year that an editorial mistakenly linked former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's rhetoric to an Arizona mass shooting. Palin lost her libel suit because she couldn't prove the newspaper erred without concern for the truth.Some advocates for free speech worry that the Dominion-Fox lawsuit ultimately could give a conservative Supreme Court a chance to revisit the standard set in the case, known as New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. While the case has been among the court's most durable precedents, the newly empowered conservative majority has indicated a willingness to challenge what had been considered settled law — as it did last year in overturning abortion rights.Two Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in giving the precedent another look.In dissenting from a 2021 decision not to take up a libel case, Gorsuch wrote that what began in 1964 as a decision to tolerate occasional errors to allow robust reporting “has evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods by any means and on a scale previously unimaginable.” He said the modern media landscape is much different today, and suggested it was less careful.“My wish is that the parties would settle and this case would go away,” said Jane Kirtley, director of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and the Law at the University of Minnesota. “I don't see any good coming out of it.”A perceived strength in Dominion's case also worries some supporters of the press.Dominion says Fox was, in effect, torn between the truth that Joe Biden legitimately won the race and pleasing viewers who wanted to believe Trump's lies. In depositions released last week, Murdoch argued that Fox as a network did not endorse the claims, but that some of its commentators — Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times did.Murdoch was among several at Fox to say privately they didn't believe the claims made by Trump and his allies that widespread fraud cost him reelection. In his deposition, Murdoch said he could have prevented guests who were spouting conspiracies from going on the air, but didn't.“One of the defenses is that even false speech about public figures is protected so long as it is believed by the speaker,” First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams said. “But no one at Fox appears ready to say that he or she did believe the assertions ... and there now appears to be substantial evidence that no one there at Fox did so. It's a major blow.”Fox's entire prime-time lineup privately disparaged Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, according to court papers. Laura Ingraham, in a text to Carlson, called her a “nut.” In a deposition, Hannity said he did not believe her theories “for one second.” Nevertheless, Powell was interviewed on Fox 11 times between Nov. 8 and Dec. 10, 2020, according to court papers.Dominion’s lawyers say Fox is arguing that it has no legal responsibility for broadcasting even the most horrible allegations, knowing they are false, as long as they are deemed newsworthy.Fox said Dominion is presenting an extreme view of defamation, one in which the network had a duty not to report the allegations but to suppress them or denounce them as false.“Under Dominion's approach, if the president falsely accused the vice president of plotting to assassinate him, the press would be liable for reporting the newsworthy allegations so long as someone in the newsroom thought it was ludicrous,” Fox lawyers said in court papers.“Such a rule would stop the media in its tracks,” Fox said.There's a high bar for proving libel — and that's deliberate, First Amendment attorney Lee Levine said. Dominion has to show that a reasonable audience could conclude that someone at Fox was making these allegations, not just the interview subjects, he said.Still, Levine said, Dominion has the strongest defamation case he's seen in 40 years of being involved in the topic.George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center, said Fox should cite a lesser-known “neutral reportage” standard that dates back to a court case from the 1970s. It holds that news organizations should not be discouraged from reporting something newsworthy even if there are serious doubts about the truth, as long as that information comes from responsible and prominent sources.But the U.S. Supreme Court has not weighed in on that argument, and a number of lower courts have rejected it. It's also not clear that the defense would be legally applicable in the Dominion case against Fox.There is sentiment in Republican circles that the Sullivan standard goes too far in protecting news organizations.DeSantis last month urged the Supreme Court to revisit libel laws, saying they are used to smear politicians and discourage people from running for office. A bill being considered in the Florida Legislature would significantly weaken standards in the state. Trump said last year that the court should consider his own defamation lawsuit against CNN a “perfect vehicle” for revisiting precedents.Some media law advocates that the University of Minnesota’s Kirtley has talked to privately, people who are usually eager to support the press in libel cases, are queasy about publicly backing Fox in the voting machine lawsuit.Many see the case as a surrogate to hold Fox and Trump supporters accountable for what happened after the 2020 election, she said.“I don’t think a libel suit is the vehicle to deal with this, and you have to think about what damage could be done to libel law if Dominion wins,” she said.]"

That surprise move could exert an unforeseen impact on US tech companies after years of relying on the firm for access to domestic markets.Once a state-owned electronics factory, Inspur is one of the country’s oldest IT brands: Its transistors went into China’s first man-made satellite in 1970. The company has since blossomed into a server specialist and joined an informal club of Chinese national champions that include Huawei Technologies Co. and chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.Inspur’s clout and market reach attracted a host of foreign companies that found it difficult to crack the Chinese market. It set up joint ventures with Cisco and IBM several years ago so that their products can more easily gain Chinese approvals and pass security checks — a common practice. In return, Inspur benefits from its US partners’ longer experience in dealing with international markets.A representative for Inspur said the company “has noticed relevant reports and is working to verify and evaluate,” and had no other comment. Spokespeople for Cisco and Intel declined to comment. Representatives for IBM didn’t reply to requests for comment.Inspur established its JV with Cisco’s Hong Kong subsidiary in 2016 and the Chinese company owns 51% of the shares, according Tianyancha, a platform that tracks company registration information disclosed by the government. A $145 million venture with IBM’s Chinese investment arm was created two years later, with Inspur also owning 51%. It also partnered with Intel last year on cloud technologies, according to the US company’s website.Story continuesRead more: US Expands Crackdown on China With Export Ban on Inspur, BGIIt’s unclear how long Washington has kept an eye on Inspur.

So it’s understandable that when you’re looking for stocks to buy, you may sometimes miss some obvious well-priced choices that are right in front of you.Some of the best names out there fall into the category of over-$100 stocks to buy. The average price for a stock in the S&amp;P 500 index right now is just under $170. If you aren’t willing to pay at least three digits for a stock, you’re going to be leaving a lot of names on the bench.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI recommend using the Portfolio Grader tool to help find the best over-$100 stocks to buy. The Portfolio Grader analyzes every stock based on its momentum, earnings reports, recent performance, analyst sentiment and other factors to come up with an “A” through “F” grade.Just as in school, you want to be looking for those “A” and “B” names – and keep the “D” and “F” stocks off your report card.I ran these names through the Portfolio Grader and they’re at the head of the class.

That’s an interesting place for investors right now, as the White House is pushing clean energy incentives.Shares are about $210 each, but that’s a bargain price compared to just three months ago when ENPH stock was selling for $330. Investors appear to be concerned that demand for solar energy is softening thanks to concerns about a recession and high inflation.Story continuesIt’s notable that Enphase seems to be doing just fine even in these less-than-ideal conditions. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $724.7 million, versus Wall Street’s consensus prediction of $704 million. It was much better than a year ago when ENPH posted revenue of just $412.7 million.Clearly, the global push to go green isn’t going to go away. And once Wall Street comes back to its senses and sees that Enphase is a bargain, the stock should rebound and then some.ENPH has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.International Business Machines (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the oldest and best-known names in the computer world, IBM (NYSE:IBM) may not be the top dog these days. But the company is staying relevant with its efforts with artificial intelligence, or AI.The company is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on an AI-focused project to examine NASA’s trove of Earth and geospatial science data.Full-year revenue for 2022 came in at $60.5 billion, which was an increase of 6% from 2021. And the company also posted its largest annual sales increase in history during the fourth quarter.If you need another reason to hold IBM stock, remember that it pays a quarterly dividend with a yield of 5%, that’s been growing for 29 consecutive years.IBM stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Ingredion (INGR)Ingredion Canada Inc head office in Brampton, Ontario, CanadaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYou may not be familiar with Ingredion (NYSE:INGR) but you may know about some of its products. Ingredion makes starches, non-GMO sweeteners, stevia and pea protein. Its products are used in foods, beverages, paper and even pharmaceuticals.It claims more than 19,000 customers around the world, and its products are used in manufacturing facilities on five different continents.Revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.02 billion, which narrowly missed analysts’ estimates. But it still showed a strong 14.75% increase from a year ago. Earnings per share were $1.65, which was 20 cents per share better than the Street expected.As a consumer goods stock, Ingredion is a solid performer that’s priced at just over $100. You won’t mistake it for a sexy growth stock, but this is a name that you can hold on to for a long time.

The Ireland-based company has a market capitalization of more than $25 billion and has a solid drug pipeline to treat thyroid eye disease, inflammatory diseases, gout and rare disorders.Its best-selling drug is Tepezza, which is approved in the U.S. to treat eye bulging and double vision and generated more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market.That got a lot of attention, so not surprisingly, Horizon is in play. Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) announced in December that it planned to purchase Horizon in a $26.4 billion deal.HZNP stock is up 80% in the last six months, largely due to sale rumors that were finally confirmed in December with Amgen’s announcement. If and when the sale goes through, HZNP shareholders would get $116.50 per share in the all-cash deal – so there’s still some room to buy Horizon now and lock in those gains.HZNP stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Amgen (AMGN)Source: ShutterstockEven without the Horizon deal, I like Amgen as a solid buy and an excellent dividend stock. The California-based company has a strong pipeline of drugs on its own, including treatments for bone cancer, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.And if you are bargain shopping, then AMGN is looking really interesting here. The stock is down 10% so far in 2023 following a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report that saw year-over-year revenue slip by nearly 1%.But there’s still a lot to like here. Its Prolia osteoporosis treatment saw sales increase 14% from a year ago. Cardiovascular drug Repatha had sales increase by 33% from a year ago.AMGN has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Moderna (MRNA)red text reads ""moderna"" on a light blue background. there is a bottle of liquid vaccine next to a medical needleSource: diy13 / ShutterstockPretty much everyone knows about Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), which was one of the leading manufacturers of a Covid-19 vaccine thanks to its messenger RNA-based approach.The coronavirus helped push Moderna to profitability – the company began churning out a profit for the first time  in the first quarter of 2021.Sales for 2022 came in at $18.4 billion. Moderna is forecasting $5 billion this year in Covid-19 sales, primarily coming from booster shots.Does that mean profits will fall again? I don’t think so. Even though the company’s getting less money now from its Covid-19 treatment, Moderna has 44 treatment and vaccine candidates in development. Of those, 21 are in clinical trials.MRNA stock is on sale right now, down 24% so far in 2023.

With a market capitalization of more than $300 billion, Chevron has upstream exploration and production operations in the U.S., Australia, Nigeria, Angola, Kazakhstan and in the Gulf of Mexico.Earnings for 2022 came in at $35.5 billion, a huge increase from $15.6 billion in 2021. Chevron shared the wealth by dishing out $11 billion in dividends and spending $11.25 billion in share buybacks.Even after all that, Chevron managed to have $17.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2022, plus another $223 million in marketable securities.Chevron stock slipped at little in the first two months of the year, down 10%, but the company is destined to bounce back stronger than ever, while still paying a dividend yield of 3.7%.

Yet, you might be surprised to discover how committed this company is to advancing the science of machine learning. While it’s not right for every investor, IBM stock may be the AI industry pick you’ve been looking for.Sure, there are other publicly listed businesses with machine learning angles. Some of them might even put “AI” in their names just to get the message across.Meanwhile, IBM is an old company that some folks ignore, but they shouldn’t. As IBM continues to innovate and push the boundaries of modern technology, prospective AI market investors should take notice.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM $129.05IBM Stock Provides AI Exposure without Extreme VolatilityNow, it’s time for a gut check. How much risk are you prepared to bring to your tech portfolio? Consider this: IBM stock has a five-year monthly beta of 0.85, which means it has historically tended to move slower than the overall stock market. Therefore, this isn’t a stock that will appeal to financial traders seeking fast gains.But then, not everyone who wants to add machine learning exposure to their portfolio is a thrill seeker. If IBM is a “steady Eddie” type of company, this should suit some volatility-averse investors.Just because IBM stock isn’t a fast mover, doesn’t mean the company isn’t on the cutting edge of technology. For instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to work with IBM to “develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations.”IBM Confirms Its Commitment to Advancing AIIn case you’re not convinced yet that IBM is dedicated to advancing the science of AI, feel free to read IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna’s prepared quarterly remarks. Krishna assures that IBM has “been co-creating with many clients to deploy AI at scale.”Story continuesTo back up his claim, Krishna reminds investors of IBM’s collaborations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the British Broadcasting Company (BBC). Moreover, the chief executive states, “By applying AI and automation we have helped security analysts reduce the time to respond to threats from hours or days, to minutes.”On top of all that, IBM revealed in a blog post that the company has built an AI-optimized supercomputer, known as Vela, in the cloud.If you needed evidence that IBM isn’t a dinosaur company, here it is. Technology geeks should appreciate Vela’s specs, which include a “large GPU memory (80 GB), and a significant amount of memory and local storage on the node (1.5TB of DRAM, and four 3.2TB NVMe drives).”IBM Stock Should Appeal to Some Tech InvestorsIf you’re in the market for a pure AI play that offers thrills and chills, IBM stock isn’t it. However, some people are perfectly satisfied investing in a more diversified business with “steady Eddie” qualities.So, feel free to consider a share position in IBM for low-stress exposure to the machine learning field. You just might find a hidden gem as IBM proves itself, time and again, as a thoroughly modern innovator.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Meanwhile, Wolfe said the results were ""solid,"" but still slashed the price target by $5 to $160 per share.Chevron raises its share repurchases target rateChevron (NYSE:CVX) said it will buy back stock at a targeted rate of $17.5B starting in Q2, up from its prior level of $15.2B in the final three months of last year. Its guidance range for buybacks was also bumped up to between $10B and $20B per year.

""Assuming a similar cadence in '23-'25, we see MPC generating cumulative OCF (pre-WC) of $35bn and repurchasing ~$23bn or ~38% of its market cap through 2025 (Ex-2).

""We are going to have many, many more markets that we were not even previously in.""EASING THE ELECTRIC JOURNEYElectric vans provide far more data points for Ford and its rivals to work with - including tracking how much range they have left and providing easy, comprehensive charging solutions.Ford's Schep said providing that data is crucial for van fleets because according to the automaker's research, 60% of its corporate customers ""are really worried about the journey to electric.""The UK operations of DHL Express, part of the Deutsche Post DHL Group, has 270 electric Ford E Transit vans with firm orders for 120 more, and is signing up for FORDLiive.Fleet director Richard Crook said aside from monitoring those vans' batteries, he wants to tap Ford's predictive maintenance capabilities.""We need to get ahead of things and plan maintenance schedules because the vehicle is actually telling you 'I have a problem,'"" Crook said.Ford rival General Motors Co has also rolled out telematics services including ""in-vehicle coaching,"" where a voice nicknamed ""Karen in the vehicle"" coaches drivers against excessive braking, speeding or other bad habits.Michelle Calloway, director of OnStar Business Solutions at GM, said ""Karen"" cut fuel use by 30% in 30 days in one customer's fleet.""Those are impactful savings scaled across a large fleet,"" Calloway said.Starting with 2024 models, GM will provide a range of OnStar data services free for fleet vehicles. Ed Peper, who heads GM's fleet sales, said once customers try those services, they are likely to pay for more.Italian truck, van and bus maker Iveco Group NV has around 150,000 connected vehicles using telematics services and has seen a 30% increase in uptime, plus a ""single-digit percent"" drop in warranty costs so far, said chief technology officer Marco Liccardo.Liccardo estimates subscription services will generate 40% to 50% of commercial vehicle makers' profits by 2030 and help franchise dealers survive the shift to electric with fewer parts to service.""Data will be the oxygen to do that,"" Liccardo said.

70,46a8e8b3-5f2d-3a08-9521-161a34c0b8d0,GM,2023-03-06,RPT-COLUMN-Automakers rush in where miners fear to tread: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-column-automakers-rush-where-010000998.html,1678064400,STORY,"['HG=F', 'LAC', 'GM']","[(Repeats Friday's column with no changes to text)By Andy HomeLONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The race for electric vehicle (EV) battery metals is heating up.Automakers can't go green without having sufficient quantities of the lithium, nickel and cobalt that make the batteries work.Fear of missing out, quite literally, is generating an industry-wide shift to investing directly in the mining sector to ensure future supplies of the battery inputs.General Motors Co has announced a $650-million investment in Lithium Americas Corp to help fund development of the Thacker Pass project in Nevada.GM gets exclusive rights to 40,000 tonnes per year of lithium from a domestic mine, which is key to qualifying for the EV subsidies available under the Inflation Reduction Act.Carmakers have already been busy tying up supplies of battery metals under direct off-take agreements with existing metals producers.Now they are getting into the business of actually digging the mines, or at least helping with the finance.The investment rush has until now largely played out in the lithium sector but French-Italian carmaker Stellantis has just pivoted into copper with an investment in an Argentinian project.COPPER PIVOTStellantis, the third largest automotive group by sales, will pay $155 million for a 14.2% stake in McEwen Copper, a subsidiary of Canada's McEwen Mining, which owns the Los Azules project in Argentina.The deposit, ranked in the top 10 global undeveloped copper resources by Mining Intelligence, is expected to yield 100,000 tonnes per year of refined cathode from its anticipated start date in 2027.The automaker's investment comes with an option to purchase the mine's output at a ratio equivalent to its equity ownership.With the help of existing shareholder Nuton, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, and its copper leaching technology, McEwen is aiming to make the mine carbon-neutral by 2038, adding to the project's green credentials.Story continuesCopper is an often forgotten component of EV batteries, but it plays a critical role as a current collector. All battery chemistries require copper, albeit to varying degrees. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, a burgeoning part of the EV market, need around 50% more copper than nickel-manganese-cobalt, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Outside of the battery pack copper is also used in the electric motor, the busbar and in what can be up to a mile of internal wiring.The amount of copper used in a typical battery electric vehicle is 83 kilograms, compared with just 23 kilograms in an internal combustion vehicle, according to the International Copper Association.FEAR OF FALLING SHORTStellantis' leap upstream in the copper processing chain follows similar deals with Germany's Vulcan Energy for lithium and Australia's Element 25 for manganese.The copper investment has the same strategic rationale, one of ""ensuring strategic supplies of raw materials necessary for the success of the Company's global electrification plans"", to quote Stellantis.Automakers' collective move into the mining sector has so far largely prioritised the lithium sector, where Western companies have been playing catch-up with Chinese investors.Lithium supply is struggling to scale up at the speed required to meet accelerating demand from battery-makers. Even with a recent pullback in the spot Chinese market, the price of lithium carbonate has risen seven-fold since the start of 2021.Where lithium is today, copper could be tomorrow, if you believe Glencore, which has warned of a cumulative shortfall of 50 million tonnes by 2030 under the IEA's net zero emissions pathway.Imminent shortfall has been part and parcel of the copper narrative for many years, largely due to poor visibility on future project time-lines.However, this time could be different given the sector's chronic under-investment in new mine capacity. Producers have been collectively scarred by the experience of the 2000s, when they spent heavily on new mines only to see the copper price slide steadily lower over the first half of the 2010s.Capital expenditure in the sector slumped, miners opting to return cash to shareholders rather than dig more big copper mines. It hasn't recovered despite the pick-up in the copper price from a cycle low of $4,318 per tonne in 2016 to $9,000.Current guidance ""points toward 34% less growth capex deployed in nominal terms between 2022-2026 than was deployed over the same time frame during the early-mid 2000's,"" according to Goldman Sachs. (""Copper: The end of surplus"", Dec. 6, 2022).If copper producers remain too wary of investing in future supply growth, automotive capital may be the answer. It is already a key enabler in the build-out of lithium, nickel and manganese production capacity.BACK TO THE FUTUREThe automotive sector is driving back to the future, the new rush to take control of supply chains an echo of Henry Ford, who famously bought iron and steel operations to supply the iconic River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's ambition to own the full automotive supply chain from mine to product was driven by the raw material shortages created by the first world war.The company's modern-day successors are faced with the same raw materials shortfall across the battery metals spectrum. If they could have sourced their metals using their favoured horizontal supply chain model, they would have done.But so intense is the competition for battery metals and so entrenched the dominant Chinese operators that Western automotive companies have little choice but to invest directly in the next generation of supply projects.However, the move upstream comes with plenty of potential pitfalls.Greenfield mines have a history of running late and over budget, particularly when they are experimenting with new processing technology such as is being deployed at many lithium projects.It's worth remembering that Henry Ford's vertical integration model wasn't always successful.The Brazilian rubber plantations, intended to supply latex for tire production, were plagued by poor yields and bad relations with the local workforce. It didn't help that Ford initially insisted on a Midwestern diet and participation in events such as square-dancing.However, even after the rules were relaxed and the operations transferred to a more promising site, Ford's Brazilian dreams were overtaken by the invention of synthetic rubber.Ford ended up selling the assets back to the Brazilian government for just $250,000 without having achieved a commercially viable operation.It's a useful reminder that going upstream can be a high-risk business for even the biggest automotive companies.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

Powered by the monstrous growth in the electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy markets, these stocks have generated handsome returns for their investors. For instance, one of the leading exchange-traded funds in the niche, the Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF, has gained over 127% in value over the past three years.The stock market rout last year dented the battery market in a big way. LIT stock shed more than 15% of its value, compared to the S&amp;P 500’s drop of around 8%. Perhaps one of the main reasons for the ETF’s sluggish performance last year could be that a hefty portion of its holdings is in growth stocks. Growth stocks remained in Wall Street’s crosshairs amidst the market’s risk-off sentiment in 2022.Nevertheless, the potential of some of the top battery stocks remains as enticing as ever over the long term. Moreover, with the stocks down near historical lows, it’s perhaps an ideal time to add them to your portfolios.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsALBAlbemarle$250.59LACLithium Americas$23.24HONHoneywell$194.21TMToyota$137.02QSQuantumScape$8.79SLDPSolid Power$3.15GMGeneral Motors$39.42Battery Stocks: Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. LITM Stock.Source: tunasalmon / ShutterstockAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) operates a leading specialty chemicals firm operating in three primary divisions, including bromine specialties, catalysts, and lithium. Lithium has been its fastest-growing division, with net sales rising by double-digit margins over the past several quarters.In its recently released fourth-quarter results, net lithium sales were up more than five-fold from the same quarter last year to $2.06 billion. The robust results had plenty to do with the strength in its pricing, as lithium prices charged by the firm climbed by more than four-fold. As we advance, ALB expects to raise lithium prices this year by at least 55%, an emphatic response to the bears who feel a slowdown is imminent.Story continuesALB stock outperformed the market last year, generating over 30% returns when the S&amp;P 500 was firmly in the red. Considering an incredible top and bottom-line outlook for the year, ahead of consensus estimates, expect the stock to climb even higher this year.Battery Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC)smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screenSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is arguably the best pick-and-shovels battery play this year. It’s sitting on a gold mine of a lithium asset, and the Thacker Pass Project is poised to become a cash flow machine for the business in the not-so-distant future. I said not-so-distant future because LAC got approval for its project after a lengthy court trial last month. Moreover, General Motors (NYSE:GM) recently announced a massive $650 million investment in advancing the project. To put things in perspective, the asset has a total life of 40 years and a yearly EBITDA visibility of a whopping $1.18 billion.In addition to its blockbuster Thacker Pass project, it boasts a 44.8% stake in the Cauchari-Olaroz project based in Argentina. The project has an annual EBITDA visibility of a massive $308 million, and LAC plans to separate its international asset into a new entity which could potentially unlock new value.Battery Stocks: Honeywell (HON)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) is an applied science and industrial giant with its tentacles in multiple technologies. It boasts a massive portfolio of traditional and renewable energy sources, which continue to deliver steady growth for its business. Moreover, the firm has grown its business profitably, boasting double-digit expansion in its EBITDA and free cash flow margins over the past several years.Its energy storage systems cover the entire 4-hour, 10-hour, and Long-term discharge cycle through its lithium-ion, flow, and hydrogen batteries. Its energy storage systems are part of its Performance Materials and Technologies segment, which has demonstrated 11% organic growth in the past year. Moreover, it witnessed double-digit growth in organic orders during its most recent quarter, with segment margins at an impressive 22%.Furthermore, according to Tipranks, HON stock still has a 14.1% upside potential, which should have it trading at its 52-week high price of $220.9.Toyota (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comMost of the top automotive manufacturers are partnering with battery tech start-ups to build a presence in quantum glass or solid-state batteries. However, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been taking a different approach by building its expertise in the niche. Though it’s been criticized for its progress in the EV sphere, it’s hard to deny its commitment to solid-state batteries.Toyota intends to spend a massive $13.6 billion on batteries over the next ten years, including a major portion in solid-state batteries. It has gathered over 1,000 patents in the technology and to aims to have its first vehicle using quantum glass batteries by 2025. Perhaps the biggest advantage that the firm has over the pure plays in the sector is that it has a thriving core business to fall back on. Hence, investors need not worry about Toyota’s investments in quantum glass sinking the stock.QuantumScape (QS)The entrance to QuantumScape Headquarters QS stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comQuantumScape (NYSE:QS) is arguably a pioneer in developing solid-state batteries and perhaps a front-runner in space. Its business developments suggest that it’s on course to push toward the commercialization phase. It recently shared data on its solid-state batteries completing 400 consecutive 15-minute fast-charging cycles. Additionally, it shipped its 24-layer lithium battery cells to automotive OEMS for testing late last year.It remains a pre-revenue firm for now, but the situation could change quickly once its batteries roll out of its factories for public use. Moreover, it still has $1 billion in its cash till and the backing of automotive giants such as Volkswagen to continue pushing the boundaries of its technology.Solid Power (SLDP)Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comColorado-based Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is another solid-state battery pure-play making superb progress in the sphere. Test results on its batteries continue to impress as it looks to push toward commercialization aggressively. Its sizeable cash balance of over $300 million and the backing of automotive titans such as BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Ford (NYSE:F) provide an excellent growth runway ahead.SLDP recently agreed to expand its partnership with BMW, licensing its solid-state manufacturing process to the automotive giant. Moreover, SLDP has begun producing EV cells in its pilot line and expects to reach the commercialization stage by 2026. Also, it recently received a $5.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to continue the development of its solid-state battery cells. SLDP stock is trading under $3, much cheaper than QS stock, and boasts similar prospects. Therefore, it’s a more effective wager at current price levels.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is another top legacy automotive giant, which many would consider the best car business in the world. Electrifying its business seems to be a core agenda for GM as it aims to become a front-runner in the sector. It will invest a dumbfounding $7 billion in its home state of Michigan to expand the production of its battery cells and electric vehicles. The Detroit company aims to change the game through its Ultium Platform consisting of software, batteries, and other related components. At the heart of the Platform are the firm’s batteries developed in conjunction with LG Energy Solutions. It uses a high chemistry that effectively reduces the tough-to-source cobalt by around 70% while pushing battery costs below $100 per kilowatt-hour. As we advance, the Platform will only improve as GM invests boatloads of cash to position it for further growth.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Target The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$273.4mUS$3.41bUS$4.26bUS$4.90bUS$5.60bUS$6.42bUS$7.02bUS$7.52bUS$7.94bUS$8.31bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.36%Est @ 7.17%Est @ 5.64%Est @ 4.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% -US$255US$3.0kUS$3.5kUS$3.7kUS$4.0kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.1%) = US$168bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$168b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$85bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$120b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$166, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.847. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TargetStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Multiline Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

New Visa Study Finds a Third of Canadians Have Fallen for Fraud More Than Once,CNW Group,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spot-scam-visa-study-finds-130700272.html,1678108020,STORY,['V'],"[This Fraud Prevention Month, Visa shares the most common language and terms used by fraudsters to lure Canadian consumers.TORONTO, March 6, 2023 /CNW/ - Canadians are transacting digitally more than ever before. Quick, frictionless, real-time payments have created many benefits for consumers, but this has also created a wider landscape for fraudsters (also known as ""threat actors""). As personal information is digitized, consumers are at increased risk of being targeted by threat actors seeking to get a hold valuable information. Canadians and The Language of Fraud: Report (CNW Group/Visa Canada)Visa developed a linguistic analysis called, ""The Language of Fraud,"" to reveal how language is used by scammers and understand the risks and vulnerabilities Canadian consumers experience during fraud attempts.  According to the report, threat actors craft messages designed take advantage of consumer willingness to trust too-good-to-be-true texts and emails.The report highlights how criminals have reached a new level of sophistication to ensnare the savviest Canadian consumers who believe they are experts at spotting them. Canadians are confident in their ability to spot a scam when they see it, with more than half (58%) considering themselves highly knowledgeable about fraudulent behaviours.1However, a turn of phrase can turn a simple click into a breach of personal information. Whether in the workplace or on the go, Canadians receive multiple offers by phone, text, and email for ""free gifts"" and traps to ""act now"" to supply personal information before a vital service gets cut off. This is what Visa calls, ""The Language of Fraud"", and it is working.More than one third (35%) of Canadians admit to having fallen for a scam on one or more occasions.2 Over half (59%) of those surveyed in Canada said they typically respond to terms or phrases fraudsters commonly use in emails or text messages.3""Canadians are cautious about financial security threats, but it is crucial to remain diligent when it comes to security hygiene. Be sure to update passwords regularly, avoid clicking on links in any unsolicited emails or texts, and never give out sensitive data to anyone over the phone unless you are sure who you are talking to,"" says Maryam Saeed, Head of Risk at Visa Canada. ""Trust and security are foundational to Visa's network, and we pride ourselves as being a trusted partner in the payments ecosystem – providing the right solutions to minimize risk.""Story continuesFraud Prevention Month is a valuable time for Canadian businesses and consumers to educate themselves about financial security threats, learn about evolving protection measures, and do all they can to make sure they are protected.While cybercrime persists, Visa is mission-driven to protect consumers and mitigate fraud. Over the past five years, Visa has invested more than $10 billion in technology to counter fraud and increase network security.4 More than a thousand dedicated specialists protect Visa's network from malware, zero-day attacks and insider threats, around the clock and year-round. In 2022 alone, Visa helped prevent an estimated $27 billion in fraud.5Visa knows that, in a digital-first economy, security is a priority for businesses of all sizes and sectors across Canada and has developed multiple fraud prevention and detection systems and programs to protect their data, and that of their customers, and encourages Canadians to make use of its online resources to learn more.About VisaVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

But continued high inflation numbers cast doubt on the idea the Federal Reserve will let up on its rate-hiking campaign. Stocks slid to end February, and uncertainty remains high. This has some investors turning to the opportunities in other areas such as emerging markets. Growth stocks in emerging markets could have much brighter prospects than American ones given the difference in macroeconomic conditions.On top of that, emerging markets underperformed dramatically as compared to the S&amp;P 500 over the past decade. This could leave emerging market growth stocks in a position to deliver superior returns going forward.These three growth stocks have a particularly strong angle for profiting as emerging markets gain strength.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceJDJD.com$46.60PACGrupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico$191.36VVisa$217.86JD.com (JD)the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a buildingSource: testing / Shutterstock.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is China’s second-largest e-commerce company. The company has differentiated itself from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) by focusing on two differentiating factors.JD has built a reputation for having authentic high-quality products, which stands out in a market where knockoffs and imitations are sometimes a concern. In addition, JD has invested heavily in logistics. Its pioneering efforts in areas such as cargo drones have helped the company stand out with rapid reliable deliveries. That edge became particularly useful during the pandemic as e-commerce became ever more vital.The numbers back this up. JD grew revenue from $55 billion in 2017 to $150 billion in 2021. For a company that was already so large, nearly tripling revenues in that span is quite the achievement.However, JD stock plunged over the past year. This came about with a slowdown in the Chinese economy. As Covid-19 restrictions lingered in the Chinese market, this impacted consumer demand. JD managed only roughly flat revenues for 2022.Story continuesBut the growth story is merely paused rather than played out. JD is projected to get back on track in 2023 and grow revenue to $172.4 billion, which would mark a 14% year-over-year increase. And now, shares are trading for less than 20 times forward earnings. With JD stock down nearly 60% from its 2021 peak, shares represent a great way to ride the Chinese e-commerce trend at an attractive price.Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (PAC)two women carrying luggage in an airportSource: Shine Nucha / ShutterstockGrupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (NYSE:PAC) is one of three publicly traded Mexican airport operators. In the early 2000s, the Mexican government privatized dozens of airports around the country. The airports along the Pacific Ocean became the Pacific Airport Group.The firm’s flagship airport is Guadalajara, which currently handles more than 15 million passengers per year and is one of the ten busiest airports in Latin America. In addition to that, the company’s Tijuana Airport has seen a boom in business thanks to a new cross-border pedestrian bridge which allows passengers to disembark and travel directly to San Diego without dealing with a highway border crossing.And on the tourist side of things, Pacifico operates the key travel airports of Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos. Mexican tourism has boomed since 2020. The country had some of the lightest Covid-19 related restrictions and testing requirements of the region, which caused many travelers to pick Mexico instead of other alternatives. This momentum has stuck, with Mexican tourism-related airports reporting 30% or greater year-over-year passenger growth recently.As if all this weren’t enough, Mexico is now securing huge amounts of foreign investment into the country as companies rapidly adjust their supply chains and set up factories closer to the United States. Pacifico, with airports like Tijuana and Guadalajara, is positioned to grab a large part of incremental new traffic in Mexico as the U.S. and Mexican economies more closely integrate.Pacifico shares have appreciated 100% over the past five years, despite the pandemic. Even so, shares still go for less than 20 times forward earnings. And with traffic growing at more than 30% annually right now, there should be plenty of earnings growth coming in the future as well.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is another great option for getting exposure to emerging markets. Historically, Visa started out as a U.S. credit card company. Nowadays, however, the market is largely tapped for credit and debit cards in developed markets such as the United States and Western Europe.Rather, the opportunity lies in emerging markets where there is far less adoption of credit to date. Cash remains a major factor in many emerging markets, and Visa stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries as these countries adopt plastic at a higher rate.This process was accelerated to a substantial degree because of the pandemic. Suddenly, retailers rushed to offer e-commerce checkout while trying to also reduce the rate of cash acceptance at physical stores. A generation of emerging market consumers that were formerly comfortable with cash have begun to explore the benefits of having a card too.According to a recent McKinsey report, noncash retail payment transactions grew at a stunning 25% per year annualized in emerging markets between 2018 and 2021. This tends to be higher-margin activity for Visa, especially when cross-border transactions with currency conversions are involved.Visa saw its earnings growth slow during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the company’s results got back on track in 2022. Shares, however, are still off their highs. V stock is currently going for 26 times forward earnings, whereas historically it has tended to trade north of 30 times. Throw in double-digit earnings growth powered by its rapid gains in emerging markets, and Visa’s future remains bright.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in PAC and V stock.

80,a4562352-6baf-32ae-a65e-80f85aa8e1b3,FOX,2023-03-06,Fox libel defense at odds with top GOP presidential foes,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-libel-defense-odds-top-050801145.html,1678079281,STORY,['FOXA'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News is on an unlikely collision course with two leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination over the rights of journalists.In defending itself against a massive defamation lawsuit over how it covered false claims surrounding the 2020 presidential election, the network is relying on a nearly 60-year-old Supreme Court ruling that makes it difficult to successfully sue media organizations for libel.Former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, two favorites of many Fox News viewers, have advocated for the court to revisit the standard, which is considered the foundational case in American defamation law.“It is ironic that Fox is relying on a landmark case that was designed to help the news media play the watchdog role in a democracy and is under attack by Gov. DeSantis, Donald Trump and other figures who have been untethered in their attacks on journalists as enemies of the people,” said Jane Hall, a communication professor at American University.Eye-catching evidence has emerged from court filings in recent weeks revealing a split screen between what Fox was portraying to its viewers about the false claims of election fraud and what hosts and executives were saying about them behind the scenes. “Sydney Powell is lying,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson said in a text to a producer, referencing one of the attorneys pushing the claims for Trump.In an email a few weeks after the 2020 election, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch described a news conference featuring Powell and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another attorney who pushed the election lies: “Really crazy stuff. And damaging.”Aside from the revelations about Fox's inner workings, the outcome could have broad implications for media organizations because of how they and the courts have come to rely on the libel law Fox is using as a shield.In its $1.6 billion lawsuit, voting machine maker Dominion Voting Systems argues that Fox repeatedly aired allegations that the company helped rig the general election against Trump despite many at the news organization privately believing the claims were false.Story continuesFox says the law allows it to air such claims if they are newsworthy.In a 1964 decision in a case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court greatly limited the ability of public officials to sue for defamation. It ruled that news outlets are protected against a libel judgment unless it can be proven that they published with “actual malice” — knowing that something was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” to whether it was true or not.In one example of how the law was applied, editors at the Times acknowledged last year that an editorial mistakenly linked former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's rhetoric to an Arizona mass shooting. Palin lost her libel suit because she couldn't prove the newspaper erred without concern for the truth.Some advocates for free speech worry that the Dominion-Fox lawsuit ultimately could give a conservative Supreme Court a chance to revisit the standard set in the case, known as New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. While the case has been among the court's most durable precedents, the newly empowered conservative majority has indicated a willingness to challenge what had been considered settled law — as it did last year in overturning abortion rights.Two Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in giving the precedent another look.In dissenting from a 2021 decision not to take up a libel case, Gorsuch wrote that what began in 1964 as a decision to tolerate occasional errors to allow robust reporting “has evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods by any means and on a scale previously unimaginable.” He said the modern media landscape is much different today, and suggested it was less careful.“My wish is that the parties would settle and this case would go away,” said Jane Kirtley, director of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and the Law at the University of Minnesota. “I don't see any good coming out of it.”A perceived strength in Dominion's case also worries some supporters of the press.Dominion says Fox was, in effect, torn between the truth that Joe Biden legitimately won the race and pleasing viewers who wanted to believe Trump's lies. In depositions released last week, Murdoch argued that Fox as a network did not endorse the claims, but that some of its commentators — Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times did.Murdoch was among several at Fox to say privately they didn't believe the claims made by Trump and his allies that widespread fraud cost him reelection. In his deposition, Murdoch said he could have prevented guests who were spouting conspiracies from going on the air, but didn't.“One of the defenses is that even false speech about public figures is protected so long as it is believed by the speaker,” First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams said. “But no one at Fox appears ready to say that he or she did believe the assertions ... and there now appears to be substantial evidence that no one there at Fox did so. It's a major blow.”Fox's entire prime-time lineup privately disparaged Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, according to court papers. Laura Ingraham, in a text to Carlson, called her a “nut.” In a deposition, Hannity said he did not believe her theories “for one second.” Nevertheless, Powell was interviewed on Fox 11 times between Nov. 8 and Dec. 10, 2020, according to court papers.Dominion’s lawyers say Fox is arguing that it has no legal responsibility for broadcasting even the most horrible allegations, knowing they are false, as long as they are deemed newsworthy.Fox said Dominion is presenting an extreme view of defamation, one in which the network had a duty not to report the allegations but to suppress them or denounce them as false.“Under Dominion's approach, if the president falsely accused the vice president of plotting to assassinate him, the press would be liable for reporting the newsworthy allegations so long as someone in the newsroom thought it was ludicrous,” Fox lawyers said in court papers.“Such a rule would stop the media in its tracks,” Fox said.There's a high bar for proving libel — and that's deliberate, First Amendment attorney Lee Levine said. Dominion has to show that a reasonable audience could conclude that someone at Fox was making these allegations, not just the interview subjects, he said.Still, Levine said, Dominion has the strongest defamation case he's seen in 40 years of being involved in the topic.George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center, said Fox should cite a lesser-known “neutral reportage” standard that dates back to a court case from the 1970s. It holds that news organizations should not be discouraged from reporting something newsworthy even if there are serious doubts about the truth, as long as that information comes from responsible and prominent sources.But the U.S. Supreme Court has not weighed in on that argument, and a number of lower courts have rejected it. It's also not clear that the defense would be legally applicable in the Dominion case against Fox.There is sentiment in Republican circles that the Sullivan standard goes too far in protecting news organizations.DeSantis last month urged the Supreme Court to revisit libel laws, saying they are used to smear politicians and discourage people from running for office. A bill being considered in the Florida Legislature would significantly weaken standards in the state. Trump said last year that the court should consider his own defamation lawsuit against CNN a “perfect vehicle” for revisiting precedents.Some media law advocates that the University of Minnesota’s Kirtley has talked to privately, people who are usually eager to support the press in libel cases, are queasy about publicly backing Fox in the voting machine lawsuit.Many see the case as a surrogate to hold Fox and Trump supporters accountable for what happened after the 2020 election, she said.“I don’t think a libel suit is the vehicle to deal with this, and you have to think about what damage could be done to libel law if Dominion wins,” she said.]"

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in Akamai Technologies, Inc.

Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 17% in three years.

Check out our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately Akamai Technologies reported an EPS drop of 18% for the last year. The share price decline of 33% is actually more than the EPS drop.

Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.2%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.1% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$37b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 2.8% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Devon Energy. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Devon Energy. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Devon Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Devon Energy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 6.6% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Devon Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$266m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Devon Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Devon Energy  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Fundamentally, we just don’t know what may lie ahead. With geopolitical flashpoints and ongoing pandemic recovery efforts, a conservative approach to the equities space may yield surprising gains.Further, investors must also recognize harsh realities. Recently, the major indices have not performed well, stemming from the latest read of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. With inflation coming in hotter than expected, the Federal Reserve may raise benchmark interest rates to combat stubbornly high prices. If so, you don’t want exclusive exposure to risk-on names. Rather, these boring stocks to buy may see you through some rough waters.DEDeere$422.32SRESempra Energy$147.43DGDollar General$214.86CAGConagra$35.79PSAPublic Storage$296.76KRKroger$44.99PFGCPerformance Food Group$57.60InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDeere (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comSince the dawn of the computer age, agricultural equipment manufacturer Deere (NYSE:DE) must have realized that eventually, the jig would be up. Nowadays, the word agriculture doesn’t even enter most folks’ minds when it comes to job opportunities. However, that’s what makes DE a perfect candidate for boring stocks to buy. Underneath the surface, it’s actually quite the innovator.Understandably, investor interest nowadays centers on artificial intelligence and machine learning: AI this, ML that. Got it. However, Deere put this technology to the test with its automated smart tractors. Not only should this innovation improve productivity, it also indirectly addresses the other point: few people in the modern age want to work in agriculture.Another benefit to being one of the boring stocks to buy is a tendency toward fiscal resilience. Against the trailing year, Deere’s operational stats make competitors envious. It features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.7% and a net margin of 14.9%, both stats above sector averages. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $473.53, implying nearly 13% upside potential.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs a utility giant, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) symbolizes a natural choice for boring stocks to buy. However, it also might be one of the most despised. Because it’s a utility, it enjoys a natural monopoly. Now, shareholders like natural monopolies since it means few enterprises can legitimately compete with the underlying entity. However, the customers obviously feel differently.Nevertheless, SRE should make for an intriguing investment despite any objections. On balance, Sempra’s dominance of the Southern California region makes it a true power player. Yes, many people may be leaving the Golden State. Still, it represents the biggest economic engine of the U.S. so Sempra’s relevance is largely assured. If you have lingering doubts, note that Sempra carries a forward yield of 3.09%. While it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.7%, the payout ratio sits at 47.73%. Therefore, the yield should be sustainable.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $170.56, implying over 15% upside potential.Dollar General (DG)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockIt might be an obvious play for boring stocks to buy. However, that doesn’t mean Dollar General (NYSE:DG) loses its potential for viability. As stated earlier, inflation remains stubbornly high. Naturally, elevated prices will challenge middle-income households. From an immediacy angle, then, DG deserves to be on your radar.Looking further down the line, it’s very possible that the Fed may hike the benchmark interest rate. In turn, this dynamic may slow economic activity due to rising borrowing costs. While this might address inflation, it could create another problem: more mass layoffs. For Dollar General, the net result ends up the same: more relevancy, more demand.According to Gurufocus.com’s analysis of Dollar General’s discounted cash flow (DCF), DG stock’s fair value stands at $273.35. Compared to the time-of-writing price of $213.79, that’s quite a bargain. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $248.50, implying over 16% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) is a packaged goods firm. Specifically, it makes and sells products under various brand names available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments. Although seemingly relevant, CAG stock gave up 8% of equity value since the start of the year.Still, this might be a temporary decline. In the trailing year, CAG gained over 3%. More importantly, global food supply chain concerns may crimp the inventory of critical commodities. In turn, demand (prices) may rise significantly, which may cynically lift CAG.To be fair, Conagra’s financials themselves don’t seem particularly remarkable but they’re not terrible either. For bullish investors, they’ll want to consider CAG’s valuation proposal. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 12.54. As a discount to earnings, Conagra ranks better than 65.78% of the competition.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg CAG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $41.60, implying over 16% upside potential. Thus, it’s worth considering as one of the top boring stocks to buy.Public Storage (PSA)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Unless you’re a big fan of the TV show “Storage Wars,” Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) might come off as one of the very boring stocks to buy. However, it could turn out to be surprisingly relevant. For instance, with many people priced out of owning real estate, they may need storage in a bid to rent smaller residential units to save money.Even more distressing, some people might need to downsize their homes out of force. For such a situation, Public Storage can help mitigate challenges. To be sure, PSA presents a decent performer so far this year, gaining nearly 8% of equity value.Notably, Public Storage’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.72 times. In contrast, the sector median PEG is 2.04 times. Moreover, the enterprise enjoys strong operational stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 13.2% outpaces over 86% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PSA as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $348, implying nearly 18% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid case for boring stocks to buy.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comIn many ways, the case for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the boring stocks to buy sells itself. You only need to go back a few years. During the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Kroger and similar grocery store outlets became the place for essentials (after scouring hardware stores for N95 masks). Now, economic downturns don’t promote such intensity of emotions. But the demand should still be there.Put another way, Kroger benefits from the trade-down effect. With consumers feeling the pressure, they’ll need to trade down their expectations. Gone will be eating out at restaurants. In its place will stand cooking meals at home. That should boost KR stock. Another factor benefitting Kroger is its value proposition. Presently, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.31. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 84.75% of the competition. Lastly, covering analysts peg KR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.86, implying nearly 20% upside potential.Performance Food Group (PFGC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA food enterprise that has its roots in the late 19th century, Performance Food Group (NYSE:PFGC) distributes a range of food products. It has three divisions, each catering to specific market segments. Conspicuously, it’s truly one of the boring stocks to buy. Since the January opener, PFGC gained less than 1%. In the trailing year, it’s down less than half a percent.According to Gurufocus.com, PFGC represents a fairly valued investment. To be blunt, on an objective basis, it appears a bit overvalued. Nevertheless, it offers strong growth metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.5%, beating out over 93% of its rivals. Its book growth rate during the same period pings at 19.8%, above 88% of the industry.However, it’s the analyst view that has people talking. Currently, PFGC features a strong buy consensus view. Indeed, out of 12 analysts, only one has a hold assessment, meaning it was close to a unanimous strong buy. Further, the experts’ average price target stands at $73.36, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Brands (NYSE:YUM) have made a favorable return of 72% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-yum-brands-nyse-yum-120039821.html,1678104039,STORY,['YUM'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) shareholders have enjoyed a 57% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 40% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 17% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Yum! Brands managed to grow its earnings per share at 4.1% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Yum! Brands' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Yum! Brands's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Yum! Brands, it has a TSR of 72% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Yum! Brands shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 17% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Yum! Brands is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant...If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Strong momentum across electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions is a positive.Increasing power design wins are other positives. Solid momentum of HEV platform across cabin electronics ecosystem is a tailwind. The company also remains optimistic about the growth prospects related to 5G. Considering the above-mentioned factors, we expect first-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue to rise 15.3% year over year.However, weak momentum across major applications and leveraged balance sheet are concerns.

Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.”Berkshire Hathaway bought Coca-Colain 1994 and American Expressin 1995. It still owns big positions in both stocks. The annual letter says that Coke paid Berkshire $75 million in dividends in 1994 and by 2022 it was paying $704 million. That’s the power of patience, discipline and compounding over the course of 28 years.What can the rest of us learn from great investor’s long-term stock trades?5 Stocks for Long-Term Investors1.       Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK)In 1950, Anne Scheiber, considered one of the most successful retail investors ever, bought 1,000 shares of Schering-Plough for $10,000. She held it for 45 years until her death in 1995. After 45 years, the shares were worth $7.2 million, with dividends reinvested. Schering-Plough was bought by Merck in 2009.Story continuesMerck still pays a dividend. It is currently yielding 2.75%.Should Merck be on your short list?2.       Coca-Cola Inc. (KO)Coca-Cola has paid a dividend for 60 consecutive years. Not only that, it has actually raised it every year during that time. It’s a true dividend aristocrat.But shares of Coca-Cola have lagged the S&amp;P 500 since Buffett bought it. It’s up just over 400% since Aug 31, 1994 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 734% during that same time.Should you sacrifice performance for Coca-Cola’s dividend?3.       Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (COKE)What if Buffett had bought the Coca-Cola bottler, instead of the beverage company, in 1994? Coca-Cola Consolidated pays a dividend too, but it’s only yielding 0.4% in 2023.But shares of Coca-Cola Consolidated have outperformed in that time. $10,000 invested in Coca-Cola Consolidated would have been $304,464 by Mar 1, 2023. Shares were up 2,952% during that time.Should you look beyond the well-known big cap names with a company like Coca-Cola Consolidated?4.       American Express (AXP)American Express has been a staple in Buffett’s portfolio since 1995. It paid Berkshire $41 million in dividends that first year but in 2022 it paid $302 million.American Express is currently yielding 1.2%.Shares of American Express have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since 1995. Shares are up 1,359% since Dec 29, 1995 compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was up 556% in that same period.Should American Express be on your short list?5.       Chevron Corp. (CVX)Chevron has only recently been added to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio so it doesn’t have a 28-year track record in the portfolio like Coke does. But it does also have an outstanding dividend paying track record. Coincidence? Chevron has raised it’s dividend 36 consecutive years.In Jan 2023, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend again, raising it 6%, or $0.09, to $1.51. It currently yields 3.8%.Should long-term investors consider buying Chevron?What Else Do You Need to Know About How to Be a Great Long-Term Investor?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

95,ab6c8148-bfe5-353c-8da9-fd7c727c8bf7,TSCO,2023-03-06,"With EPS Growth And More, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) Makes An Interesting Case",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eps-growth-more-tractor-supply-143136274.html,1678026696.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply How Quickly Is Tractor Supply Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Tractor Supply's EPS has grown 28% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Tractor Supply maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 11% to US$14b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Tractor Supply?Story continuesAre Tractor Supply Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Tractor Supply has a market capitalisation of US$25b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$64m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Tractor Supply, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.The Tractor Supply CEO received US$11m in compensation for the year ending December 2021. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Tractor Supply Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Tractor Supply's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that Tractor Supply is worth keeping an eye on. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Tractor Supply that you need to be mindful of.Although Tractor Supply certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ULTA)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-ulta-beauty-inc-nasdaq-140248359.html,1678024968,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Let's talk about the popular Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ulta Beauty’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty What's The Opportunity In Ulta Beauty?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 20%, trading at US$522 compared to my intrinsic value of $433.70. This means that the opportunity to buy Ulta Beauty at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Ulta Beauty’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Ulta Beauty?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 8.9% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Ulta Beauty, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ULTA’s future outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ULTA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ULTA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Ulta Beauty from their most recent forecasts.

The initiatives are based on the preliminary findings of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) following the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.Norfolk Southern Corporation Logo (PRNewsfoto/Norfolk Southern Corporation)""Reading the NTSB report makes it clear that meaningful safety improvements require a comprehensive industry effort that brings together railcar and tank car manufacturers, railcar owners and lessors, and the railroad companies,"" said Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan H. Shaw. ""We are eager to help drive that effort and we are not waiting to take action.""Norfolk Southern will immediately begin the following initiatives:Enhance the hot bearing detector network.  Norfolk Southern is evaluating the distance between hot bearing detectors, which currently averages 13.9 miles on its core network.  The company will examine every location on its core network where the distance is more than 15 miles and develop a plan to deploy additional detectors where practical due to terrain and operating conditions.  The company anticipates adding approximately 200 hot bearing detectors to its network, with the first installed on the western approach to East Palestine. Pilot next-generation hot bearing detectors.  Norfolk Southern is working with manufacturers to accelerate the testing and deployment of safety technology on its network that can scan a greater cross-section of a railcar's bearings and wheels. These so-called ""multi-scan"" hot bearing detectors may offer the potential to catch overheated bearings more effectively.Work with industry on practices for hot bearing detectors.  Norfolk Southern intends to work with the industry on a comprehensive review of standards and practices for the use of hot bearing detectors.  In addition to reevaluating the temperature threshold at which an alarm is triggered, the company plans to work with peers to analyze data for patterns that could provide earlier warnings of potential safety issues.  Norfolk Southern also plans to partner with other railroads to review best practices, including response to high-temperature alarms. Deploy more acoustic bearing detectors.  In addition to enhancing its use of hot bearing detectors, Norfolk Southern will immediately accelerate the deployment of acoustic bearing detectors, which play a different role in its safety inspection program.  These detectors analyze the acoustic signature of vibration inside the axle and can identify potential problems that a visual inspection could not.  Norfolk Southern will add 13 new detectors to the five already in service, stationing these devices on high-traffic routes around our core network.  This will strengthen the early-warning system that identifies potential risks before they become issues.Accelerate our Digital Train Inspection program.  Norfolk Southern is partnering with Georgia Tech Research Institute to develop a next generation of its most advanced safety inspection technology, which uses machine vision and algorithms powered by artificial intelligence to identify defects and needed repairs much more effectively than traditional human inspection.  Ultra-high-resolution cameras stationed in strategic locations around its network will give Norfolk Southern a 360-degree health check on railcars, improving its ability to detect, diagnose, and repair defects before they become issues.  The company is accelerating the installation of the next phase of this new technology on its Premier Corridor, which connects the Midwest and Northeast and is the line that runs through East Palestine. Support a strong safety culture. Norfolk Southern has agreed to join the Federal Railroad Administration's Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS). By joining the program, Norfolk Southern is building upon its own long-standing Close Call Experience Program, which encourages railroaders to speak up if they see something that is unsafe.Story continuesThese enhanced safety measures follow the Feb. 23 release of the NTSB's preliminary report, which traced the derailment and the initial fire to an overheated axle on car number 23, which was carrying plastic pellets. Subsequent NTSB testing indicated that the aluminum covers over the pressure relief valves on three of the five tank cars carrying vinyl chloride melted. The NTSB found that Norfolk Southern's rail crew operated the train within the company's rules and operated the train below the track speed limit. Additionally, the NTSB reported that wayside hot bearing detectors were operating as designed.About Norfolk SouthernSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and its predecessor companies have moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy. Today, it operates a customer-centric and operations-driven freight transportation network.

UNP and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2061493/2-railroad-stocks-with-solid-dividend-yield-to-watchThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry continues to suffer from headwinds like raging inflation, higher interest rates, high fuel price and supply-chain disruptions.Even though oil price has declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 1.3% over the past six months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 0.6% appreciation and 5.1% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like United Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.”Berkshire Hathaway bought Coca-Colain 1994 and American Expressin 1995. It still owns big positions in both stocks. The annual letter says that Coke paid Berkshire $75 million in dividends in 1994 and by 2022 it was paying $704 million. That’s the power of patience, discipline and compounding over the course of 28 years.What can the rest of us learn from great investor’s long-term stock trades?5 Stocks for Long-Term Investors1.       Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK)In 1950, Anne Scheiber, considered one of the most successful retail investors ever, bought 1,000 shares of Schering-Plough for $10,000. She held it for 45 years until her death in 1995. After 45 years, the shares were worth $7.2 million, with dividends reinvested. Schering-Plough was bought by Merck in 2009.Story continuesMerck still pays a dividend. It is currently yielding 2.75%.Should Merck be on your short list?2.       Coca-Cola Inc. (KO)Coca-Cola has paid a dividend for 60 consecutive years. Not only that, it has actually raised it every year during that time. It’s a true dividend aristocrat.But shares of Coca-Cola have lagged the S&amp;P 500 since Buffett bought it. It’s up just over 400% since Aug 31, 1994 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 734% during that same time.Should you sacrifice performance for Coca-Cola’s dividend?3.       Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (COKE)What if Buffett had bought the Coca-Cola bottler, instead of the beverage company, in 1994? Coca-Cola Consolidated pays a dividend too, but it’s only yielding 0.4% in 2023.But shares of Coca-Cola Consolidated have outperformed in that time. $10,000 invested in Coca-Cola Consolidated would have been $304,464 by Mar 1, 2023. Shares were up 2,952% during that time.Should you look beyond the well-known big cap names with a company like Coca-Cola Consolidated?4.       American Express (AXP)American Express has been a staple in Buffett’s portfolio since 1995. It paid Berkshire $41 million in dividends that first year but in 2022 it paid $302 million.American Express is currently yielding 1.2%.Shares of American Express have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since 1995. Shares are up 1,359% since Dec 29, 1995 compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was up 556% in that same period.Should American Express be on your short list?5.       Chevron Corp. (CVX)Chevron has only recently been added to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio so it doesn’t have a 28-year track record in the portfolio like Coke does. But it does also have an outstanding dividend paying track record. Coincidence? Chevron has raised it’s dividend 36 consecutive years.In Jan 2023, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend again, raising it 6%, or $0.09, to $1.51. It currently yields 3.8%.Should long-term investors consider buying Chevron?What Else Do You Need to Know About How to Be a Great Long-Term Investor?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Now turning to Slide 3. 2022 was a year of growth and strong execution for Syndax. We made great progress working towards our long-term goals, all of which put us firmly on the path of becoming a fully integrated commercial stage biopharmaceutical company delivering two best-in-class products to patients in areas of high unmet medical need. On Revumenib, we made significant progress, enrolling patients in the AUGMENT-101 pivotal trials announced breakthrough therapy designation for patients with relapsed/refractory KMT2A rearranged acute leukemia and presented robust updated Phase I data that further supported Revumenib's best-in-class clinical profile in two oral sessions at the 2022 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.Story continuesFurther, we initiated additional Phase I trials designed to test Revumenib in a variety of settings, including combinations with standard-of-care regimens. For axatilimab, we completed enrollment in the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial, published the initial Phase I/II chronic graft-versus-host disease data set in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and made progress expanding the axatilimab development program in collaboration with our partner, Incyte. We are fortunate to have Incyte as a strong collaborator to help us successfully advance axatilimab development. Additionally, in December, we bolstered our balance sheet with a $172.5 million follow-on offering, our cash runway is now expected to extend into the second half of 2025, allowing us to appropriately invest to maximize the value of our pipeline, prepare for two potential U.S. commercial launches in 2024 and pursue potential business development opportunities.Our focus, determination and unending commitment to patients has propelled us forward to this critical year, a year that we expect will be marked by pivotal readouts and registration filings for our 2B drug candidates, both of which are first and potentially best-in-class treatments. 2023 is an incredibly significant year for Syndax, and I'm confident that we have the expertise and resources to execute on our goals, along with the determination to realize the future in which people with cancer live longer and better than ever before. Turning to Slide 4, we provide a high-level summary of our current corporate priorities. Starting with Revumenib, our highly selective Menin inhibitor, our pivotal Phase II AUGMENT-101 trial evaluating Revumenib in patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1 mutant or KMT2A rearranged acute leukemia is progressing well.We are happy to report that we have completed enrollment of a sufficient number of patients with a KMT2A rearrangement to support a registration filing, and we are on track to report top line data from the trial in the third quarter of 2023. This data would provide the basis for an NDA filing by year-end 2023. I will provide more details on AUGMENT-101 later in the call. In addition to the AUGMENT-101 trial, we have ongoing trials testing Revumenib in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with standard of care medicines to treat these forms of acute leukemia. We are committed to unlocking the full potential of this important therapy. With that goal in mind, we expect to have several additional data readouts in 2023 for Revumenib. These include initial top line data from AUGMENT-102 chemo combination trial in relapsed/refractory acute leukemia patients, safety data from the dose escalation phase of the BAML cooperative trial of Revumenib in combination with venetoclax/azacytidine, in newly diagnosed AML patients and initial top line data from the first solid tumor proof of concept trial in metastatic colorectal cancer.Moving to axatilimab, our antibody against CSF-1R. We remain on track to report top line data in mid-2023 from the pivotal Phase II AGAVE-201 trial, evaluating axatilumab in patients with chronic graft versus host disease or cGVHD, and plan to submit a BLA filing by the end of 2023. To maximize the value of the axatilimab program, we anticipate initiating additional trials in 2023, including a combination of axatilimab and ruxolitinib in frontline cGVHD that we expect Incyte to be in later this year as well as a Phase II trial of axatilimab in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, that we anticipate kicking off in the first half of 2023. We continue to evaluate potential opportunities to in-license earlier-stage targeted oncology compounds that we believe could become high-value differentiated assets.We believe that we have sufficient capital to bring in new early-stage assets but our bar for doing so is quite high as any compound would need to complement our current pipeline and fit in with our long-term corporate strategy. Let's now turn to Slide 5, and I'll provide further details on the revumenib program. As you recall, the Phase II portion of AUGMENT-101 is designed as three single-arm pivotal trials with distinct patient populations that enroll independently. These patient populations are KMT2A rearranged ALL, KMT2A rearranged AML and NPM1 mutant AML. The primary endpoint of each pivotal trial is a percentage of patients achieving CR/CRh with secondary endpoints, including durability of CR/CRh response, transfusion independence, overall survival and safety.In December, we received Breakthrough Therapy designation or BTD for Revumenib for the treatment of all adults and pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory KMT2A rearranged acute leukemia, whether presenting as acute myeloid or acute lymphoid phenotype. The receipt of BTD underscores the potential if approved for Revumenib to be the first drug to address the breadth of unmet medical needs in KMT2A or leukemia, accounting for up to 10% of all acute leukemias. Based on the broad breakthrough therapy designation and our ongoing conversations with regulators, we will pool the data generated from both the AML and ALL-KMT2Ar cohorts into a single NDA filing aimed at an indication to treat all relapsed/refractory acute leukemia patients with a KMT2A rearrangement.Thanks to the enthusiastic support of our investigators. We have already enrolled a sufficient number of patients with KMT2A rearrangements in the Phase II portion of the AUGMENT-101 trial to enable this filing strategy. We expect to share top line data from this population in the third quarter and file an NDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory KMT2Ar acute leukemia in adult and pediatric patients by the end of 2023. Separately, we continue to enroll relapsed/refractory NPM1 mutant AML patients and expect to report completion of enrollment for these patients in the second half of 2023. These trials are enrolling well, and there was significant excitement for Revumenib by investigators at the ASH Annual Meeting in December, where we presented updated Phase I data that Briggs will take you through on Slide 6.Briggs?Dr. Briggs Morrison: All right. Thank you so much, Michael. So as many of you know at the ASH Annual Meeting in December of last year, Dr. Ghayas Issa from the MD Anderson Cancer Center presented updated results from the Phase I portion of the AUGMENT-101 trial in two oral presentations. Of the 60 patients evaluable for efficacy in the Phase I portion, 30% attained a CR/CRh. And notably, in patients treated at the recommended Phase II dose, CR/CRh was the same in both KMT2AR and NPM1 subsets at 27%. The median duration of CR/CRh response was impressive in this very advanced patient population at 9.1 months. There was a high MRD negativity rate of 78% among patients achieving CR/CRh, which is very meaningful in this patient population as it enables patients to proceed to potentially curative bone marrow transplant.We also reported compelling data on 12 patients who achieved a response on Revumenib treatment and then went on to receive a stem cell transplant. And additionally, three transplant patients who were treated with Revumenib maintenance therapy in the capacitate use setting following stem cell transplant or non-myeloablative stem cell boost, two of whom remained in remission for over a year as of the data cutoff. As a reminder, in the pivotal trial, patients can be restarted on Revumenib after bone marrow transplant, the design feature that provides data on the potential role of Revumenib in the post-transplant maintenance setting. Revumenib continues to be well tolerated, and there have been no discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events.Pharmacy, Medicines, HealthPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashAs we look across the development landscape, we believe the data continued to support Revumenib's compelling clinical profile and position it as not only first-in-class, but a best-in-class treatment. I'll now turn it back over to Michael.Michael Metzger: Great. Thanks, Briggs. Turning to Slide 7. Given the compelling clinical and safety profile we have observed with Revumenib, our clinical development plan seeks to expand its use beyond relapsed/refractory setting into earlier settings and in combination with approved therapies. Here we highlight our ongoing trials of Revumenib across the full treatment landscape. Starting with the Phase Ib AML umbrella trial. As part of our collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Revumenib is being combined with venetoclax/azacytidine to treat newly diagnosed AML patients with an NPM1 mutation or KMT2A rearrangement who are unfit for induction chemotherapy. Revumenib is the first menin inhibitor to be included in the trial, which will assess safety as well as initial efficacy.Enrollment is ongoing, and we expect initial safety data from this trial to be available in 2023. Longer term, we expect that positive -- the AML trial results could lead to a Phase II/III trial, which could serve as the basis for future regulatory filing. We are also currently enrolling patients in the AUGMENT-102 trial designed to assess Revumenib in combination with standard salvage chemotherapies for patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1 mutant or KMT2A rearranged acute leukemias. We also expect to have initial data available from this trial in 2023. And finally, the INTERCEPT trial. This trial was recently initiated as part of the INTERCEPT Master Clinical Trial led by The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group. This trial is a creative approach to treating patients early in their disease course as it is focused on investigating novel therapies to target early relapse and clonal evolution as pre-emptive therapy in AML.It is designed to explore the activity of Revumenib, the first menin inhibitor to be included as monotherapy in patients with AML who have MRD-positive disease following initial treatment, a group of patients at very high risk of relapse. We are also in the process of planning a trial in combination with standard of care intensive chemotherapy, used to treat fit patients in the frontline setting. We plan to initiate that study in the second half of this year. As is detailed on Slide 8, unlocking the full potential of Revumenib beyond the relapsed/refractory acute leukemia setting by moving it earlier in treatment and in combination with other approved agents has the potential to add meaningful value both for our shareholders and even more importantly, for patients in need.With these expansion opportunities, we see the potential to address upwards of 12,000 NPM1 mutant and KMT2A acute leukemia patients across various edits. These two forms of acute leukemia together represent up to 40% of the overall AML population, which, to our knowledge, will be the largest subpopulation of AML to be addressed by new targeted therapies. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies targeting KMT2A or NPM1 acute leukemias. We anticipate that Revumenib could become the backbone of choice for patients with KMT2Ar and NPM1-mutant acute leukemia and we are also looking to explore Revumenib as a treatment in solid tumors based on the compelling preclinical signs supporting the role of the menin-MLL1 interaction in data continuum driven tumors.A proof-of-concept signal-seeking Phase I clinical trial in colorectal cancer is open for enrollment, and we expect to report top line data by year-end 2023. Let me now turn to axatilimab, our potentially best-in-class monoclonal antibody therapy targeting the CSF-1 receptor that has the potential to serve as an effective practice-changing intervention in this underserved population. Slide 9 provides an overview of the pivotal AGAVE-201 dose-ranging trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with cGVHD. The trial has completed enrollment of 240 patients whose disease has progressed after two prior therapies. We're at least two years of age and have met overall entry criteria. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups, each investigating a distinct dose of axatilimab, given every once -- given either every once or every two weeks or once every four weeks.The primary endpoint is overall response rate using the 2014 NIH consensus criteria for cGVHD, while secondary endpoints include duration of response and validated quality of life assessments using the modified leases and scale. We continue to expect to report top line data from the AGAVE-201 trial in mid-2023. For us, the terms of our collaboration agreement, Incyte will be leading the regulatory filing in cGVHD, which we expect will occur in the later part of 2023. Slide 10, details the results from the Phase I/II trial, which showed axatilimab's ability to provide meaningful clinical responses in chronic GVHD patients that have been refractory to multiple prior therapies. This data was presented at the 2021 ASH Annual Meeting and subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December.These data were well received among thought leaders who recognize axatilimab is having a clinical profile that would benefit -- will be a benefit in the treatment of these heavily pretreated patients. The overall response rate in the trial was 68% and the median time on treatment was over six months. The overall response rate in the Phase II portion was 82% and the median time to response was rapid at four weeks. Importantly, clinical responses were accompanied by a reduction in the cGVHD symptom burden and improvements in all cGVHD involved organ systems. Additionally, more than half of the responders reduced their use of steroids. Axatilimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile in this refractory population with the most common adverse events consistent with on-target effects of CSF-1R inhibition.Slide 11 highlights the broad clinical and commercial opportunity for axatilimab. cGVHD represents a high unmet medical need and an important commercial opportunity with approximately 14,000 patients suffering from cGVHD in the U.S. today. We and Incyte believe the data generated to date with axatilamab suggests it has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of cGVHD, both as monotherapy and given the safety profile in combination with complementary medicines. Thus, in collaboration with Incyte, we are enthusiastic about expanding the axatilimab program into frontline cGVHD in combination with ruxolitinib, and we expect a Phase I combination trial in patients with newly diagnosed cGVHD to begin later in 2023. The successful commercial launches of Incyte's Jakafi and Sanofi's are encouraging, both posting meaningful early revenues that begin to speak to the commercial opportunity in cGVHD.Axatilimab has a differentiated mechanism of action from these products and could potentially offer a unique set of benefits to patients once approved. Beyond cGVHD, we are excited about the opportunity to expand axatilimab into fibrotic diseases where the monocyte macrophage lineage plays a key role. We expect to initiate a robust Phase II trial in IPF in the first half of 2023. If successful, we believe this trial, along with one additional Phase III trial, could form the basis for FDA approval for the treatment of IPF. Through combinations in the frontline setting as well as the opportunity to expand to ex U.S. markets, we envision the cGVHD opportunity growing meaningfully. I will now turn the call over to Keith to review our financial results.Keith Goldan: Thank you, Michael. Let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Turning to Slide 12. The results of our operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the comparison to the prior year's quarter are included in our press release. So I will not repeat them in these remarks. Additional financial details are available in our fourth quarter and full year report, which was filed earlier this afternoon on Form 10-K. I'd like to point out that our net loss for the fourth quarter was $39.2 million or $0.62 per share compared to a net gain of $96.2 million or $1.81 per share for the same period last year. This difference is primarily attributed to the recognition of the upfront payment from Incyte related to the axatilimab collaboration, which we entered into in December of 2021.For the full year of 2022, our net loss was $149.3 million or $2.46 per share compared to a net gain of $24.9 million or $0.48 per share for the same period last year. Again, the difference is largely due to the upfront payment in December 2021 from Incyte. We ended the fourth quarter with $481.3 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities, including the net proceeds of $162 million from our follow-on offering completed in December of 2022 and 69.3 million shares and prefunded warrants outstanding. Our current cash is expected to provide a runway into the second half of 2025 and covers our aggressive development and pre-commercialization plans for both the Revumenib and axatilimab programs as well as provides us flexibility should we decide to selectively engage in early-stage business development.Looking ahead, I'd like to provide financial guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect research and development expenses to be $30 million to $35 million and total operating expenses to be $40 million to $45 million. For the full year of 2023, the Company expects research and development expenses to be between $160 million to $175 million and total operating expenses to be $225 million to $240 million, including approximately $30 million of noncash stock compensation expense. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Michael.Michael Metzger: Thank you, Keith. And as you've heard during the call, 2022 was an exceptional year of growth and execution, but it represents only the beginning of what Syndax aims to accomplish in the near future. With two pivotal trial readouts and potential registration filings in 2023 for our two lead drug candidates, both of which are first and potentially best-in-class treatments. Syndax is at the beginning of a significant transition into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, serving multiple patient populations of high unmet medical need. In addition, both programs offer the potential for broad franchise opportunities beyond their initial registration indications, adding to Syndax's long-term growth potential.We have ambitious goals and milestones that I've set out for 2023, and I'm confident that we have the right plan and team in place to execute on them. Further, we are in a strong financial position with a balance sheet that allows us to deliver on key near-term milestones. As always, I want to express our deep appreciation to the Syndax team, collaborators and, most importantly, the patients trial sites and investigators involved with our clinical programs. It is all of you who help us to execute on a mission of realizing a future in which people with cancer live longer and better than ever before. And I'd also like to thank our committed long-term investors who continue to share in our vision and support us in building Syndax. And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator and open the call for questions.See also 11 Most Profitable Energy Stocks and 25 Largest Energy Companies by Market Cap.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Fundamentally, we just don’t know what may lie ahead. With geopolitical flashpoints and ongoing pandemic recovery efforts, a conservative approach to the equities space may yield surprising gains.Further, investors must also recognize harsh realities. Recently, the major indices have not performed well, stemming from the latest read of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. With inflation coming in hotter than expected, the Federal Reserve may raise benchmark interest rates to combat stubbornly high prices. If so, you don’t want exclusive exposure to risk-on names. Rather, these boring stocks to buy may see you through some rough waters.DEDeere$422.32SRESempra Energy$147.43DGDollar General$214.86CAGConagra$35.79PSAPublic Storage$296.76KRKroger$44.99PFGCPerformance Food Group$57.60InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDeere (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comSince the dawn of the computer age, agricultural equipment manufacturer Deere (NYSE:DE) must have realized that eventually, the jig would be up. Nowadays, the word agriculture doesn’t even enter most folks’ minds when it comes to job opportunities. However, that’s what makes DE a perfect candidate for boring stocks to buy. Underneath the surface, it’s actually quite the innovator.Understandably, investor interest nowadays centers on artificial intelligence and machine learning: AI this, ML that. Got it. However, Deere put this technology to the test with its automated smart tractors. Not only should this innovation improve productivity, it also indirectly addresses the other point: few people in the modern age want to work in agriculture.Another benefit to being one of the boring stocks to buy is a tendency toward fiscal resilience. Against the trailing year, Deere’s operational stats make competitors envious. It features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.7% and a net margin of 14.9%, both stats above sector averages. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $473.53, implying nearly 13% upside potential.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs a utility giant, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) symbolizes a natural choice for boring stocks to buy. However, it also might be one of the most despised. Because it’s a utility, it enjoys a natural monopoly. Now, shareholders like natural monopolies since it means few enterprises can legitimately compete with the underlying entity. However, the customers obviously feel differently.Nevertheless, SRE should make for an intriguing investment despite any objections. On balance, Sempra’s dominance of the Southern California region makes it a true power player. Yes, many people may be leaving the Golden State. Still, it represents the biggest economic engine of the U.S. so Sempra’s relevance is largely assured. If you have lingering doubts, note that Sempra carries a forward yield of 3.09%. While it’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.7%, the payout ratio sits at 47.73%. Therefore, the yield should be sustainable.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $170.56, implying over 15% upside potential.Dollar General (DG)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockIt might be an obvious play for boring stocks to buy. However, that doesn’t mean Dollar General (NYSE:DG) loses its potential for viability. As stated earlier, inflation remains stubbornly high. Naturally, elevated prices will challenge middle-income households. From an immediacy angle, then, DG deserves to be on your radar.Looking further down the line, it’s very possible that the Fed may hike the benchmark interest rate. In turn, this dynamic may slow economic activity due to rising borrowing costs. While this might address inflation, it could create another problem: more mass layoffs. For Dollar General, the net result ends up the same: more relevancy, more demand.According to Gurufocus.com’s analysis of Dollar General’s discounted cash flow (DCF), DG stock’s fair value stands at $273.35. Compared to the time-of-writing price of $213.79, that’s quite a bargain. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $248.50, implying over 16% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) is a packaged goods firm. Specifically, it makes and sells products under various brand names available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments. Although seemingly relevant, CAG stock gave up 8% of equity value since the start of the year.Still, this might be a temporary decline. In the trailing year, CAG gained over 3%. More importantly, global food supply chain concerns may crimp the inventory of critical commodities. In turn, demand (prices) may rise significantly, which may cynically lift CAG.To be fair, Conagra’s financials themselves don’t seem particularly remarkable but they’re not terrible either. For bullish investors, they’ll want to consider CAG’s valuation proposal. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 12.54. As a discount to earnings, Conagra ranks better than 65.78% of the competition.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg CAG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $41.60, implying over 16% upside potential. Thus, it’s worth considering as one of the top boring stocks to buy.Public Storage (PSA)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Unless you’re a big fan of the TV show “Storage Wars,” Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) might come off as one of the very boring stocks to buy. However, it could turn out to be surprisingly relevant. For instance, with many people priced out of owning real estate, they may need storage in a bid to rent smaller residential units to save money.Even more distressing, some people might need to downsize their homes out of force. For such a situation, Public Storage can help mitigate challenges. To be sure, PSA presents a decent performer so far this year, gaining nearly 8% of equity value.Notably, Public Storage’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.72 times. In contrast, the sector median PEG is 2.04 times. Moreover, the enterprise enjoys strong operational stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 13.2% outpaces over 86% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PSA as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $348, implying nearly 18% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid case for boring stocks to buy.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comIn many ways, the case for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the boring stocks to buy sells itself. You only need to go back a few years. During the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Kroger and similar grocery store outlets became the place for essentials (after scouring hardware stores for N95 masks). Now, economic downturns don’t promote such intensity of emotions. But the demand should still be there.Put another way, Kroger benefits from the trade-down effect. With consumers feeling the pressure, they’ll need to trade down their expectations. Gone will be eating out at restaurants. In its place will stand cooking meals at home. That should boost KR stock. Another factor benefitting Kroger is its value proposition. Presently, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.31. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 84.75% of the competition. Lastly, covering analysts peg KR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.86, implying nearly 20% upside potential.Performance Food Group (PFGC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA food enterprise that has its roots in the late 19th century, Performance Food Group (NYSE:PFGC) distributes a range of food products. It has three divisions, each catering to specific market segments. Conspicuously, it’s truly one of the boring stocks to buy. Since the January opener, PFGC gained less than 1%. In the trailing year, it’s down less than half a percent.According to Gurufocus.com, PFGC represents a fairly valued investment. To be blunt, on an objective basis, it appears a bit overvalued. Nevertheless, it offers strong growth metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.5%, beating out over 93% of its rivals. Its book growth rate during the same period pings at 19.8%, above 88% of the industry.However, it’s the analyst view that has people talking. Currently, PFGC features a strong buy consensus view. Indeed, out of 12 analysts, only one has a hold assessment, meaning it was close to a unanimous strong buy. Further, the experts’ average price target stands at $73.36, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Analog Devices, Inc., The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and Aon plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Analog Devices have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry over the past year (+17.6% vs. +13.8%). The company is riding on the strength across consumer, communications, industrial and automotive markets. Solid demand for high-performance analog as well as mixed signal solutions is a tailwind. Strong momentum across electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions is a positive.Increasing power design wins are other positives. Solid momentum of HEV platform across cabin electronics ecosystem is a tailwind. The company also remains optimistic about the growth prospects related to 5G. Considering the above-mentioned factors, we expect first-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue to rise 15.3% year over year.However, weak momentum across major applications and leveraged balance sheet are concerns. Pandemic induced supply-chain constraints and geopolitical tensions led by Russia-Ukraine war remain major overhangs.(You can read the full research report on Analog Devices here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Estée Lauder shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Cosmetics industry over the past six months (+0.2% vs. -1.6%) on the back of momentum in the company's online business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, its freestanding store in the U.S. saw impressive performance fueled by enhanced omnichannel capabilities and more demand for high-touch services.Estée Lauder’s strong presence in emerging markets has been a driver. Management is on track to expand its consumer reach in productive distribution across high-growth channels while strategically expanding brands into new countries.However, the company expects the rest of fiscal 2023 to remain pressurized by temporary hurdles stemming from pandemic-led curbs in China, foreign currency headwinds, heightened inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks and the risk of sluggishness in certain markets globally.(You can read the full research report on The Estee Lauder here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Aon have gained +2.7% over the past year against the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry’s gain of +2.9%.

Solid Reinsurance Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions segments continue to drive the top line.Aon has been divesting non-core operations to streamline its business. It expects that focusing on more profitable operations will generate a higher return on equity. Its pooled employer plan has reached the milestone of $1 billion in U.S. assets and commitments.The company engages in prudent capital deployment. It had around $6.7 billion fund left under its share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2022. However, elevated operating costs can put pressure on margins.

Aflac, Unum Group, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees.While it boosts employees’ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates should continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

118,22650d44-5f3b-3b52-9e36-d090651a7881,GPS,2023-03-06,Gap's (NYSE:GPS) Dividend Will Be $0.15,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gaps-nyse-gps-dividend-0-101417982.html,1678097657,STORY,['GPS'],"[The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.15 per share on the 26th of April. The dividend yield will be 4.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Gap Gap's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the dividend made up 382% of earnings, and the company was generating negative free cash flows. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 28%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.50, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.8% per annum over that time. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Gap's earnings per share has shrunk at 41% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesWe're Not Big Fans Of Gap's DividendOverall, while some might be pleased that the dividend wasn't cut, we think this may help Gap make more consistent payments in the future. The company's earnings aren't high enough to be making such big distributions, and it isn't backed up by strong growth or consistency either. Considering all of these factors, we wouldn't rely on this dividend if we wanted to live on the income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

That surprise move could exert an unforeseen impact on US tech companies after years of relying on the firm for access to domestic markets.Once a state-owned electronics factory, Inspur is one of the country’s oldest IT brands: Its transistors went into China’s first man-made satellite in 1970. The company has since blossomed into a server specialist and joined an informal club of Chinese national champions that include Huawei Technologies Co. and chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.Inspur’s clout and market reach attracted a host of foreign companies that found it difficult to crack the Chinese market. It set up joint ventures with Cisco and IBM several years ago so that their products can more easily gain Chinese approvals and pass security checks — a common practice. In return, Inspur benefits from its US partners’ longer experience in dealing with international markets.A representative for Inspur said the company “has noticed relevant reports and is working to verify and evaluate,” and had no other comment. Spokespeople for Cisco and Intel declined to comment. Representatives for IBM didn’t reply to requests for comment.Inspur established its JV with Cisco’s Hong Kong subsidiary in 2016 and the Chinese company owns 51% of the shares, according Tianyancha, a platform that tracks company registration information disclosed by the government. A $145 million venture with IBM’s Chinese investment arm was created two years later, with Inspur also owning 51%. It also partnered with Intel last year on cloud technologies, according to the US company’s website.Story continuesRead more: US Expands Crackdown on China With Export Ban on Inspur, BGIIt’s unclear how long Washington has kept an eye on Inspur.
