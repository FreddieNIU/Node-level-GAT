1,55f0f38e-4f47-31c3-aea1-08bc4f2fa455,TXN,2023-05-29,Wall Street’s Best Analyst Suggests 2 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy — Here’s What Makes Them Stand Out,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-best-analyst-suggests-233944013.html,1685317184,STORY,"['TXN', 'GFS']","[Today, investors have access to huge amounts of information that can help in pointing towards the best stocks to pick up. So much information, in fact, that it can often result in overload and confusion, rather than providing a clear signal.Therefore, it might be best to stick to an uncomplicated regime and let the stock picking experts lead the way. And on Wall Street, right now Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis is the best of the lot. According to TipRanks, a platform that tracks and measures the performance of anyone giving financial advice online, over the past year, 72% of Lipacis’ recommendations have been successful. At the same time, his choices have generated an average return of 29.7%. These metrics have positioned the 5-star expert as the Street’s Top Analyst.Recently, Lipacis has been writing up positive reviews for a pair of semiconductor stocks, believing they are primed to push ahead from here. So, let’s see what it is about these names that makes them stand out from the pack.GlobalFoundries (GFS)The first semiconductor stock we’ll look at is GlobalFoundries, an important player in the US chip industry with a large multinational presence. The company is based in Malta, New York, and has operations in the US, in the EU, and in East Asia, with a large footprint in Singapore. The company’s products are found in smart mobile devices, in IoT applications, in personal computing, and in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries.Unlike many US-based chip makers, GlobalFoundries has maintained a strong presence in its home country – with design and R&amp;D centers on the West Coast and manufacturing and foundry facilities in the Northeast. This gives the company a built-in advantage at a time of increasing geopolitical tensions with China – a major tech competitor – over Taiwan – the world’s largest chip exporter. In addition, GlobalFoundries is proactive at protecting its intellectual property, and recently filed a lawsuit against the tech and business giant IBM, alleging trade secret misappropriation.Story continuesA homefield advantage and safe secrets are good to have, but investors want to see results. GlobalFoundries’ 1Q23 numbers had some good ones, but not all the news pleased investors. The quarterly top line, at $1.84 billion, slipped 5% year-over-year, but came in just over the forecast, beating it by $10 million. At the bottom line, GlobalFoundries’ non-GAAP earnings of 52 cents per share were up 10 cents y/y and beat the estimates by 3 cents. Also of note, the company reported liquid reserves totaling $3.23 billion.However, the stock fell after the earnings release. Investors were worried by an adjusted EBITDA miss ($655 million vs. the analysts’ expectation of $694.7 million) and the concurrent announcement of changes to the management team, with new people stepping in as CFO and CBO.For his part, top analyst Mark Lipacis isn’t worried. Assessing the print, Lipacis noted the company’s ‘onshore’ US footprint as an important advantage, writing: “We view GFS as the leading trailing-node, analog/ mixed-signal foundry benefiting from IoT demand and customers moving to a fab-lite model. We continue to see GFS as a beneficiary of the nationalization of the supply chain trend. As a result, we expect GFS to maintain a premium valuation multiple.”Based on this stance, Lipacis rates GFS shares as a Buy, and he sets a $73 price target to imply a 22% one-year upside potential.Wall Street’s top analyst is hardly an outlier here. GFS shares have 12 recent analyst reviews, and these include 11 Buys against 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See GFS stock forecast)Texas Instruments (TXN)Next up is Texas Instruments, a Dallas-based firm with a long history in the tech field. The company traces its roots to 1930, and by the 1960s it had become a strong name in consumer electronics, known for its popular lines of calculators and the ‘Speak &amp; Spell’ educational toy franchise. Today, the company is known as a major supplier of analog technology, electronics, and processor chips to the industrial economy, and is a major supplier for both automotive and aerospace high-tech needs. TI still keeps a foot in the educational sector, and has several graphic calculators on the market.All of this is background to one of the world’s largest tech companies. TI boasts a market cap of $155 billion and brought in just over $20 billion in revenue last year. The firm also has a sound record of returning value to shareholders. Since 2004, the company has posted 19 consecutive years of dividend increases, while also cutting back on outstanding shares by 47%. Over the same period, TI has also shown 11% annual growth in free cash flow.However, in the most recent reported quarter, 1Q23, TI showed mixed results. At the top line, the $4.38 billion in revenue was down almost 11% from 1Q22 – but was $10 million better than had been expected. The bottom-line EPS, at $1.85, was down from $2.18 in the prior-year period, but beat the forecast by 7 cents, or 3.6%.That said, the company came unstuck with its guide. The outlook for Q2 revenue was set in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion, against the consensus figure of $4.46 billion. On earnings, the Q2 outlook calls for EPS in the range of $1.62 to $1.88; the consensus figure was $1.87.Looking under the hood at TI after the earnings release, Mark Lipacis remains optimistic. He notes the weaker performance year-over-year, but still feels confident long-term.“We highlighted TXN as our top large-cap analog pick heading into earnings because it was one of the few analog companies that saw material cut to CY23 EPS estimates (~20%), and it has been a bottom-quartile stock performer YTD… We continue to favor TXN because it is shipping below trendline, and we believe its internal manufacturing strategy will lead to share gains… We remain buyers after the print,” Lipacis noted.As such, Lipacis reiterated a Buy rating and $215 price target that indicates room for 22% share appreciation over the next 12 months.Big-name tech has never failed to pick up attention from Wall Street, and Texas Instruments has 19 analyst reviews on file, including 8 Buys, 9 Holds and 2 Sells – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Microchip Technology's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microchip Technology is:34% = US$2.2b ÷ US$6.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.34 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Microchip Technology's Earnings Growth And 34% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Microchip Technology has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 16% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 47% net income growth seen by Microchip Technology over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesWe then compared Microchip Technology's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Microchip Technology fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Microchip Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 55% (implying that it keeps only 45% of profits) for Microchip Technology suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.Additionally, Microchip Technology has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 36% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 51%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Microchip Technology's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

7,6af8254a-cbc2-3dce-b38c-7c9b35738f56,O,2023-05-29,EXPLAINER-What to expect from Nigeria's new president Bola Tinubu,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-expect-nigerias-president-bola-095825116.html,1685354305,STORY,['CL=F'],"[By MacDonald DzirutweLAGOS, May 29 (Reuters) -Nigeria's new presidentBola Tinubufaces a litany of problems, including widespread violence, double-digit inflation and industrial-scale oil theft.Hisvictoryis being challenged in court by his two main rivals in February's election, and analysts say he may need to reach out to opponents to help heal a divided nation.Here is how Tinubu proposes to address problems that many Nigerians believe worsened under his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, on whose party ticket he ran.HOW DOES HE PLAN TO FIX THE ECONOMY?Tinubu says he will build on Buhari's public infrastructure programme to create jobs and remove legal limits on government spending.Nigeria's revenue-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among its peers, according to the World Bank. Tinubu says he will reduce corporate tax to attract investment and plug tax loopholes to boost revenue.A popular fuel subsidy, which cost $10 billion last year and is driving up debt, will be phased out and the money channelled to infrastructure, agricultural and social welfare programmes.So too will a system of multiple foreign exchange rates that the International Monetary Fund says is subject to abuse and makes it difficult for investors to repatriate their money.Any new foreign borrowing will be used to fund projects that generate revenue from which debt can be repaid, Tinubu says.WHAT ARE HIS PLANS FOR THE OIL SECTOR?Crude oil theft is the biggest headache for oil companies, which have seen production tumble. Oil majors are selling shallow-water projects, mainly due to the theft and vandalism of pipelines, and shifting offshore.Tinubu says he will set up a surveillance unit to protect the country's pipelines and attract new investors with tax incentives.One of Africa's top producers of crude oil, Nigeria depends on imported refined fuels, something Tinubu hopes will eventually end after the commissioning of a new 650,000 barrels per day refinery near Lagos.Story continuesHOW WILL HE DEAL WITH INSECURITY?Spreading insecurity is a major concern for Nigerians and foreign investors, from kidnappings for ransom in the northwest to a 13-year Islamist insurgency in the northeast, separatist violence in the southeast and decades-old ethnic tensions between herders and farmers in the north-central region.Tinubu wants to recruit more soldiers and police officers, while paying and equipping them better.He says there will be ""anti-terrorist battalions"" and special forces to fight jihadists and armed gangs but also wants the military involved in community initiatives to ""win hearts and minds.""WHAT ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS?Human rights groups and media outlets including Reuters have documented abuses on all sides of the conflict in the northeast and elsewhere.The International Criminal Court prosecutor concluded in 2020 that grounds existed to open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity by both Nigeria's security forces and insurgents, but the court has not opened one.Tinubu casts himself as a champion of human rights, pointing to his time campaigning against Nigeria's former military rulers in the 1990s when he was forced into exile.But critics question whether he will hold authorities to account after he suggested that protesters who were shot at during anti-police brutality protests in 2020 should explain why they were in the locations where security forces opened fire.IS DEMOCRACY UNDER THREAT?This year's election marked nearly a quarter century of democracy in Africa's most populous nation, and many hoped that it would be its most credible yet thanks to an increasingly professional electoral commission and measures to curb fraudulent practices rife in many previous polls.But malfunctions in new equipment used to verify voters' identities and transmit results, along with instances of violence and disruption of voting in some areas, undermined confidence in the process.Tinubu's closest challengers, Atiku Abubakar from the main opposition People's Democratic Party and the Labour Party's Peter Obi have challenged the result in court.Tinubu was declared the winner with 37% of the vote and turnout was just 29%, according to results released by the Independent National Electoral Commission.(Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Alexandra Zavis and Toby Chopra)]"

But some members of the house expressed discontent with the deal and threatened to block it.Still, the deal helps ease some concerns over an imminent U.S. default, after weeks of intense negotiations kept oil markets on edge. The prospect of a default tied into fears that worsening economic conditions will erode oil demand this year.Brent oil futures rose 0.8% to $77.56 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.9% to $73.33 a barrel by 21:24 ET (01:24 GMT). Oil was also supported by the prospect of increased U.S. fuel demand thanks to the memorial day weekend, which usually heralds the beginning of the travel-heavy summer season.Focus this week is now on key manufacturing and services activity readings from China, which are expected to shed more light on a rebound in the world’s largest oil importer. Signs of a slowdown in Chinese crude demand had rattled oil markets through May, putting them on course for a fifth straight month of losses.Crude markets remained on edge over strength in the dollar, which steadied around a two-month high against a basket of currencies on Monday.

(NYSE:CRM) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 81% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-favoured-120031741.html,1685361631,STORY,['CRM'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Salesforce's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Salesforce. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 4.6% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Marc Benioff directly holds 2.8% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$6.7b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.The stock market turmoil caused by rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies didn’t see an end in 2023. Amid uncertainty, the demand for stable, mature and reliable stocks increased. That’s why major, large-cap companies are clearly beating small-cap stocks this year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 7.3% year to date, while The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 was down 3.3%, as of May 16. A recent WSJ report quoted data from Dow Jones Market Data which showed that this spread of 10.6% percentage points shows the S&amp;P 500's biggest outperformance through May 16 since 2020.Hedge funds are also upping their bets on blue chip stocks. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds updated to reflect the Q1 portfolios shows that major blue chip companies remain popular among the elite hedge funds in the US. Technology sector remains the most favorite area to invest in for smart money investors.Why Invest in Blue Chip Stocks?However Raymond James said in its primer on blue chip stocks that these equities are not the go-to options for growth investors. However, the reliability and dividend income that is promised by several major blue chip stocks make these stocks attractive for investors. Here's how Raymond James explains the lure of blue chip stocks:Clearly, blue chips are unlikely candidates for growth investors seeking above average returns in a short period of time. But blue often possess understated value that could make them a superior investment over time. One of the chief advantages of blue chips is their dual investment value. As equities, their share price appreciates with earnings growth, albeit at a lower rate than a growth stock. Then there’s the dividend income which most blue chips are likely to payout to investors. Over the long term, the combination of gradual stock price appreciation and regular dividend income (made all the more attractive if there is a dividend re-investment program), can give blue chip investments a very reasonable long-term rate of return.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 blue chip stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds15.

(NYSE:BRK-B) bought back about $4.4 billion worth of its stock during the quarter.14. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had been under pressure amid rising competition and subscription growth challenges. But Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is taking strong steps to spur growth. That has caused a 21% growth in its stock price in 2023 through May 26. Reports suggest that Netflix, Inc.

The biggest stakeholder of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in this period was Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company.13. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was perhaps one of the biggest beneficiaries of the regional banking collapse seen earlier this year as people withdrew their funds from smaller banks and flocked to large banks like JPMorgan. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up about 4% over the past one year. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is also a dividend payer. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1 per share, which is payable on July 31 for shareholders on record as of July 6.A total of 112 hedge funds had stakes in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:UNH) ranks 12th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In April UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) posted solid Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $6.26, beating estimates by $0.18. Revenue in the quarter jumped about 14.7% year over year to $2.12 billion.A total of 116 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Inc.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”11. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Hedge funds are initiating stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) amid signs that the Chinese ecommerce retailer could rebound in the near future. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) recently denied rumors circulating in the media that it was planning to cut 20% of its workforce. Instead, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) plans to hire 15,000 people this year, according to a report from Reuters. Earlier in May Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) posted its fiscal Q4 results. Adjusted EPADS for the fourth quarter came in at $1.56, beating estimates by $0.21.

The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organisational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Perhaps no list of top blue chip stocks could be complete without Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Insider Monkey’s database of 943 funds shows that 131 hedge funds had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)at the end of the March quarter.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) which is still up from the May 26 stock price of around $173.Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology provider in telecommunications, computing, and services. Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives particularly tight engagement with consumers and enterprises, which is fostering the growing purchase of high margin services like music, apps, and Apple Pay. While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives. Aside from production disruptions, negative sentiment had also weighed on shares as investors questioned how an economic slowdown would affect consumer demand for Apple products in 2023. However, management projected an acceleration in earnings for the fiscal first quarter, where they noted that iPhone and services growth should remain strong, along with encouraging impacts around product mix, lower input costs, and continued cost controls.”9.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers. Management’s constructive assessment of 2023 prospects. coupled with the rapid rollout and adoption of generative Al offerings, led to positive share price performance.”8. salesforce.com, inc.

Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.""7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Payments giant Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)  in April posted strong Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.80, beating estimates by $0.09. Revenue in the period jumped about 9.6% year over year to $5.7 billion, beating estimates by $60 million.Reuters recently reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is looking to expand its crypto-linked payment cards program.Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management owns a $2.1 billion stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”6. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) recently posted strong earnings for the most recent quarter, beating estimates for both earnings and revenue. After the earnings report Susquehanna's Syam Patil gave bullish comments for the stock, impressed by its quarterly results and guidance. The analyst said Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is seeing “continued solid top-line traction while demonstrating discipline on the cost side.”BTIG also reiterated its Buy rating on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) after the quarterly results.Hedge fund sentiment around Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) jumped in the first quarter. Insider Monkey’s database shows that 144 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of March, up from 135 funds in the previous quarter.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 15 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To see more such jobs, go directly to 5 Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.By now you must have heard or read about how AI-powered bots are coming for millions of jobs. Whether or not they will make all of us redundant and how our collective future would be shaped by this development is a separate debate. But it’s important to note that companies have already started using AI technologies to assist, and in some cases replace, humans. Take multinational home repair services company HomeServe, for example. The company recently deployed AI-powered bot named “Charlie” at its call center. According to a detailed report by the Wall Street Journal, the assistant takes a whopping 11,400 calls a day, which is impossible for any human. The AI agent also assists human staff in their daily work, schedules repair appointments, processes claims, among a plethora of other tasks.Call centers is just one area where AI has arrived to make a difference. Earlier this year a report by Goldman Sachs made a lot of rounds in the media. The report said that automation could affect about 300 million full-time jobs in the US. The threat of AI taking over human jobs jumped exponentially after companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) started to aggressively roll out AI applications.Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Employment: Is it All a Hype?While the fear about AI taking away jobs isn’t unfounded, it’s vastly blown out of proportion due to lack of historical context. A research paper titled Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? by David H. Autor shares some interesting insights into how human history has always seen jobs come and go. Humans over the course of history have shown a dramatic capability of adaptation or evolution. Consider the fact that 41% of workforce in the US was employed in the agriculture sector in 1900. That percentage fell to just 2% by 2000. This massive change was ushered in by automated machinery in the agriculture sector. What happened to these millions of workers? They didn’t starve to death, but evolved and probably thrived thanks to the new kinds of jobs created in the aftermath of the technological revolution.Story continuesHow Many Jobs AI Has Replaced?Another important data point shared in the research paper shows how automation creates new jobs and actually ends up increasing the productivity of humans, benefitting everyone. The research says that ATM machines were first launched in the 1970s and their numbers in the US economy quadrupled from approximately 100,000 to 400,000 between 1995 and 2010. And what happened to human bank tellers? They actually rose from 500,000 to approximately 550,000 over the 30-year period from 1980 to 2010. Population increase was one of the reasons behind this growth but the most important thing to note here is that after the automation of cash handling, banks started to use bank teller staff in other, more important banking tasks (like customer relationship management).The Goldman Sachs report we talked about earlier in the article also cited the research paper by Autor and says that AI could end up creating new jobs and opportunities.“In addition, jobs displaced by automation have historically been offset by the creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth, according to the report. For example, information-technology innovations introduced new occupations such as webpage designers, software developers and digital marketing professionals. There were also follow-on effects of that job creation, as the boost to aggregate income indirectly drove demand for service sector workers in industries like healthcare, education and food services. ""Brave New WorldA research paper titled Demography as a Driver of Robonomics by Robonomics sums up its study in a paragraph that sounds eerily accurate and unsettling:The demographic changes are a driver for how governments, industry, and the ci tizenry will have to convert into a more robotized economy. A shortage of humans means that people will have to be replaced with technology, indeed research shows that middle -aged workers are already being replaced by robots in the USA. While there will be winners and losers from this transition, there will be externalities within countries and a change in international relations. The transition to a robonomic society will not be without turbulence, so humanity (and our robots) will have to be brave or at least be programmed to appear brave for the new world we are entering into. May the robotic force be with us all!Our MethodologyFor this article we consulted several research papers, scholarly articles, reliable internet articles and book summaries to shortlist the jobs that face the threat of extinction over the next five to ten years due to AI. These research papers include GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models by OpenAI and University of Pennsylvania, Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4 by Microsoft Research, Goldman Sachs’ March 2023 report titled The Potentially Large Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Growth, The Future of Employment paper by Oxford Martin School, a research paper titled How will Language Modelers like ChatGPT Affect Occupations and Industries? by researchers from University of Pennsylvania, New York University and Princeton, among other academic papers. We also consulted the website Will Robots Take My Job? The rationale behind consulting a wide range of sources was to expand our methodology and reach a consensus opinion-based ranking, minimizing biases that come with relying on a single source.Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI16. Entry-Level Programming, Data Analysis and Web Development RolesChatGPT is already being used to make plugins and micro-services based on user requirements and input. It’s not hard to believe that fifty years down the road a user would be able to just tell their AI assistant about a website they want to be made for their business and AI would make it for them in just a few minutes (or seconds?). AI-based software would also be able to perform data analysis tasks, making data analysts redundant. Technologies offered by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) will play a key role in this development.15. Entry-Level Writing and Proofreading RolesBy now it’s clear to anyone who’s used ChatGPT that it’s a great tool for basic writing tasks and proofreading. Writing tasks that do not involve any deep research, human perspective or in-depth analysis could easily be taken away by AI in the years to come.14. Translation JobsSeveral online demos have shown that ChatGPT does a far better job at translation when compared to Google Translate. As companies race to improve their language models and train their systems on foreign languages, the requirement for entry-level translators will decline.13. Entry-Level Graphic Design JobsTools like DALL.E and MidJourney are already causing a lot of layoffs in the graphic design industry since businesses can simply give input to these AI tools and make basic graphics and logos.12. Fast Food Order Taking JobsThousands of fast food restaurants around the world are already using automated machines to take customer orders. But the need for human interaction is really felt in drive-thrus, where the customer thinks, talks, and explains their orders (and sometimes makes a lot of changes). But large language models have enabled companies to start thinking of bringing AI to the drive-thru as well. Wendy’s recently revealed plans to launch AI-powered drive-thrus where bots will take customer orders. The company plans to launch the service at its locations in Columbus, Ohio. The company’s chief executive Todd Penegor reportedly said:“You won’t know you’re talking to anybody but an employee.”11. AccountingBasic accounting, bookkeeping and payroll processing usually involve some straightforward processes based on user input. That’s why a lot of research papers and studies we read during our research assign a higher risk to accounting jobs when it comes to AI.10. Postal Service Clerical JobsMillions of people receive their packages on time daily due to postal service clerks. They are the ones who make sure packages are entered in the system with correct stamps and addresses, in addition to taking money orders, helping customers fill out forms, placing mail in the correct pigeon holes of mail racks or in bags, among many other tasks. But several sources we read for our research, including the research paper by researchers at Princeton and University of Pennsylvania, believe postal service clerk roles could be automated in the future.9. Data Entry JobsCompanies are already using AI-powered systems that fetch, process, enter, format and communicate data based on user requirements. Data entry clerks were already facing redundancy throughout the world due to advanced web scraping technologies and python-based data processing scripts.8. Bank Teller JobsBank tellers perform basic and important tasks like verifying a customer’s identity and financial information before processing transactions, cashing checks, collecting loan payments, etc. Almost all the reliable resources we consulted during our research believe bank teller roles have a 100% chance of disappearing in the future because of AI. But seeing bank tellers on this list should not be a surprise to anyone. Several banks started using automated tellers long before ChatGPT. In 2017, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had forecasted that teller jobs would decline around 8 percent through 2026.7. Administrative Support JobsScheduling meetings, preparing documents, searching documents, applying basic excel formulas to retrieve data, booking flights and hotels, calling/messaging for important questions and follow-ups. These are some of the tasks performed by administrative support staff and many of these could easily be performed by AI. In fact a lot of companies have already started using ChatGPT for scheduling, taking meeting notes, booking appointments, etc.6. Legal RolesThere’s a lot more to law industry than just the lawyers who are standing in the courtroom indulged in deep arguments. Several research papers and studies believe jobs in the legal industry are facing a high risk of redundancy due to AI. Consider what a legal assistant does. They manually search tons of legal documents to find an answer, make appointments, perform client coordination and general admin tasks. All of this could easily be automated.As AI technologies offered by companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) improve, more and more jobs will face increased exposure to automation. Click to continue reading and see 5 Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI. Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 16 Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Archer-Daniels-Midland. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Archer-Daniels-Midland. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Archer-Daniels-Midland. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$240m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Archer-Daniels-Midland. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

To see more of these companies, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Agribusiness Companies in the World By Revenue.If there's one industry that has remained indispensable to the economy and to the general livelihood of the global population, it is the agriculture industry. Regardless of global events and developments within the markets or in foreign affairs, food is a commodity that can never lose its relevance. However, it is one that can be heavily impacted by economic trends, a reality that has been observed firsthand over the past few years because of rising inflation.When the economy struggles, food price inflation cannot be prevented. Any movements in the price of food are always noticed by consumers, financial professionals, and governments because they can positively or negatively impact household expenditures, cost of living, and quality of life. In 2022, food price inflation was on the rise, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The department noted that in 2022, food prices rose by 9.9%. While food-at-home prices rose by 11.4%, food-away-from-home prices rose by 7.7%. Such price increases have led to social unrest and rising tensions among the population at a time when the economy is already struggling, and consumer spending power is dwindling. It is in light of this reality that the resilience of agribusiness companies such as The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG), Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) is becoming more important than ever before.US Agriculture Outlook 2023Apart from economic problems, another hurdle faced by the agricultural industry through 2022 and well into 2023 was the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which halted supplies from one of the largest agricultural producers and exporters in the world. According to a transcription of the 99th Agricultural Outlook Forum held by the USDA in February, Ukraine was the fourth-largest exporter of corn, fifth-largest exporter of wheat, and top exporter of sunflower oil and sunflower meal. In light of the country's important position within the global agriculture industry, the blockage of supplies due to the Russian invasion did impact the industry heavily.Story continuesHowever, exports from the country through the Black Sea were resumed after the signing of the Black Sea Grain Initiative on July 22. The situation in that part of the globe has since been eased, and the US government has entered 2023 with a sense of optimism when it comes to its agriculture. It was noted at the Forum that while food price inflation has remained, it has slowed from its 2022 pace, with commodities now being on the market at lower prices. The US expects growth in total planted area for corn, wheat, and soybeans in 2023, relative to 2022, with the Department of Agriculture forecasting the combined acreage for these crops to reach 228 million acres this year. This would represent a growth of 3% from 2022. Projections for the prices of these three crops in 2023 are also currently lower than their prices in 2022.With such optimism on the rise and the situation steadily improving, it is expected that companies operating within the agriculture industry can expect to reap the benefits of these developments in 2023. Most of these companies have managed to retain their profits and grow their revenues because of the invaluable nature of the product they work to provide. As such, we have listed the top agribusiness companies by revenue operating across the globe today to highlight which names investors should keep an eye on as the situation develops further.Top 15 Agribusiness Companies in the World By RevenuePixabay/Public DomainLet's now take a look at the top 15 agribusiness companies in the world by revenue.Our MethodologyTo compile our list below, we selected companies operating within the agribusiness space with the largest revenues by the end of 2022.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide TransDigm Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group How Quickly Is TransDigm Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, TransDigm Group has grown EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that TransDigm Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.1 percentage points to 43%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for TransDigm Group.Story continuesAre TransDigm Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$44b company like TransDigm Group. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$196m. We note that this amounts to 0.4% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of TransDigm Group but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does TransDigm Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for TransDigm Group is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for TransDigm Group that you need to take into consideration.Although TransDigm Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

25,26e46846-6d3b-354c-a5a5-aa611cac6249,TDG,2023-05-29,7 Stocks That Even Company Insiders are Selling,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-even-company-insiders-012625915.html,1684977985,STORY,"['MRNA', 'AZO', 'TDG', 'WMT', 'ABNB', 'STZ', 'NVR']","[Insider buying, or the legal, reported purchase of shares in a company by its C-suite/board members/large shareholders, is considered a bullish signal. However, does that mean it is best to sell/avoid stocks insiders are selling? Put simply, it depends. Heavy insider selling, or even a lack of insider buying, can sometimes be a sign that those most “in the know” at a company are not very confident in its future prospects.Then again, much like with “outsider” investors, lack of confidence isn’t the only reason insiders decide to sell. Diversification is a big driver of insider selling decisions. There’s even a Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC)-approved mechanism for insiders to sell shares without raising red flags with investors and regulators. Through 10b5-1 plans, insiders can plan in advance to sell a particular number of shares each month over a period of months, or even years.Having said all of this, instead of making broad generations as to whether insider selling is bullish or bearish, let’s take a look at seven stocks insiders are selling, and see whether it’s a sign to buy or a sign to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAirbnb (ABNB)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonGoing public in late 2020, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) quickly zoomed higher, thanks to the post-pandemic “revenge travel” trend. However, shares in the lodging marketplace platform have fallen since then. And there are now signs that the boom times for travel are coming to an end.If that is not concerning enough, there has also been far more insider selling with ABNB stock than insider buying. In particular, by co-founder and board member Joseph Gebbia Jr. Gebbia was a big seller in 2022, and has continued to systematically reduce his Airbnb position. Granted, given these sales appear to be conducted in a pre-planned manner, this may not necessarily be a sign that you too should head for the exits. Yet as a recession looms, all while ABNB trades at a pricey 35.3 times earnings,  now perhaps may not be the time to enter/add to a position.Story continuesAutoZone (AZO)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockThe past few years have been highly favorable for AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). The U.S. vehicle shortage, which has resulted in inflated prices for new and used automobiles, has resulted in motorists holding onto their existing vehicles for longer, providing the auto parts retailer with solid demand growth.Thanks to this trend, AZO stock has kept hitting new all-time highs. That said, the boom times for AutoZone and its peers may be coming to an end, as the used car bubble deflates. At least, that’s the takeaway from the company’s latest quarterly results.AutoZone beat earnings estimates for the quarter, but investors reacted negatively to weaker-than-expected sales. It remains to be seen whether (and to what degree) AZO’s fiscal performance deteriorates from here. However, it’s not exactly encouraging that company insiders, most notably CEO William Rhodes III, have sold hundreds of millions worth of AZO shares since last fall.Moderna (MRNA)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockDuring 2021, biotech firm Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) went from early-stage to cash cow, thanks to the widespread Covid-19 vaccination wave. This pushed the stock to prices nearing $500 per share. For reference, MRNA traded for around $25 per share pre-Covid.Yet with Covid vaccines dropping off, and the company expected to re-enter the red this year, MRNA stock has given back most of these gains. Some investors may be bullish that Moderna, sitting on nearly $9 billion in cash, will put this war chest to work developing new mRNA vaccines, resulting in a profitable “second act.”However, management perhaps holds a different view. MRNA has been a stock that insiders are selling. According to MarketBeat, CEO Stephane Bancel and other insiders have sold a total of $322.71 million worth of MRNA shares in the past year. MRNA has also been one of the stocks insiders won’t buy during this time.NVR (NVR)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockAs the housing market has cooled but not yet entered “meltdown mode,” shares in homebuilder NVR (NYSE:NVR) continue to perform well. However, just because the proverbial other shoe hasn’t not dropped thus far, doesn’t mean it will not drop.In other words, the threat of a housing crash is still present. If the chances of an increase keep climbing, NVR stock could plunge, in anticipation of revenue/earnings declines. Much like with other insider selling stocks mentioned above, it doesn’t help that the sale of shares by Executive Chairman Paul Saville and other insiders has picked up in the past month.A high valuation is another reason why it may be best to skip NVR now. At 11.8 times earnings, the stock trades at a big premium to other major homebuilders. Couple these risks together, and NVR may be one of the top stocks to avoid.Constellation Brands (STZ)earningsSource: ShutterstockConstellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) isn’t the best-known alcoholic beverage stock, but many of its brands are household names. These brands include Corona and Modelo beers, along with Robert Mondavi wines. Nevertheless, the fact it has been one of the stocks insiders are selling may seem concerning on the surface. Over the past year, insiders, namely members of the founding Sands family, have made sales of STZ stock totaling $2.5 billion. Still, in contrast to the aforementioned insider trading stocks, Constellation may be worthy of consideration.Shares sell for a reasonable 20.1 times forward earnings. Sell-side forecasts call for steady earnings growth over the next few fiscal years. STZ’s move into cannabis, via a big investment in Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) has so far been a bust, full U.S. legalization (which could spark a comeback for the industry) could always emerge out of left field.TransDigm Group (TDG)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockBased in Cleveland, Ohio, TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) is a manufacturer of aircraft components. Regarded as a “serial acquirer,” TransDigm has been for years successful at making “bolt-on” acquisitions of companies in its industry. This strategy has made TDG stock a compounder, with shares up more than ten-fold over the past decade. Still, after this stunning decade-long run, it may be reasonable to assume that TransDigm is starting to top out. Shares trade at a pricey 32.7 times forward earnings.That’s not all. Keep in mind too that investing in TDG now is an example of investing in stocks insiders sell. Insider selling from CEO Kevin Stein and Directors Robert Small and Nicholas Howley has increased recently. This may signal more underwhelming returns ahead for TransDigm. Possible headwinds for the aviation industry post-travel boom is another reason why you may be another to stay away from TDG.Walmart (WMT)stocks to sell a group of businessmen holding their thumbs down. worst investments of 2020Source: ShutterstockIt may be an understatement to say Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is one of the stocks insiders are selling. Over the past year, there has been zero buying of the retailer’s shares amongst C-suite executives, board members, and large shareholders.At the same time, insiders, primarily the children of company founder Sam Walton, have sold a total of $4.66 billion worth of WMT stock. So, if you currently own this widely-held blue chip, should you follow the lead of the Waltons? Per Louis Navellier, that may be a wise move.As Navellier argued back in March, Walmart trades at a valuation premium compared to other retailers, and compared to that of the overall market. As of this writing, this premium still stands. If Walmart’s growth slows down due to the current economic headwinds, this valuation gap could narrow. The downside risk with WMT may be far larger than one would assume.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.The stock market turmoil caused by rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies didn’t see an end in 2023. Amid uncertainty, the demand for stable, mature and reliable stocks increased. That’s why major, large-cap companies are clearly beating small-cap stocks this year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 7.3% year to date, while The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 was down 3.3%, as of May 16. A recent WSJ report quoted data from Dow Jones Market Data which showed that this spread of 10.6% percentage points shows the S&amp;P 500's biggest outperformance through May 16 since 2020.Hedge funds are also upping their bets on blue chip stocks. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds updated to reflect the Q1 portfolios shows that major blue chip companies remain popular among the elite hedge funds in the US. Technology sector remains the most favorite area to invest in for smart money investors.Why Invest in Blue Chip Stocks?However Raymond James said in its primer on blue chip stocks that these equities are not the go-to options for growth investors. However, the reliability and dividend income that is promised by several major blue chip stocks make these stocks attractive for investors. Here's how Raymond James explains the lure of blue chip stocks:Clearly, blue chips are unlikely candidates for growth investors seeking above average returns in a short period of time. But blue often possess understated value that could make them a superior investment over time. One of the chief advantages of blue chips is their dual investment value. As equities, their share price appreciates with earnings growth, albeit at a lower rate than a growth stock. Then there’s the dividend income which most blue chips are likely to payout to investors. Over the long term, the combination of gradual stock price appreciation and regular dividend income (made all the more attractive if there is a dividend re-investment program), can give blue chip investments a very reasonable long-term rate of return.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 blue chip stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds15.

(NYSE:BRK-B) bought back about $4.4 billion worth of its stock during the quarter.14. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had been under pressure amid rising competition and subscription growth challenges. But Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is taking strong steps to spur growth. That has caused a 21% growth in its stock price in 2023 through May 26. Reports suggest that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started its crackdown on password sharing in the US.A total of 108 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as of the end of the first quarter. The biggest stakeholder of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in this period was Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company.13. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was perhaps one of the biggest beneficiaries of the regional banking collapse seen earlier this year as people withdrew their funds from smaller banks and flocked to large banks like JPMorgan. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up about 4% over the past one year. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is also a dividend payer. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1 per share, which is payable on July 31 for shareholders on record as of July 6.A total of 112 hedge funds had stakes in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) as of the end of the first quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s database. The biggest stakeholder of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $697 million stake in the company.12. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) ranks 12th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In April UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) posted solid Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $6.26, beating estimates by $0.18. Revenue in the quarter jumped about 14.7% year over year to $2.12 billion.A total of 116 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Inc.

(NYSE:UNH) was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.3 billion stake in the company.Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”11. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Hedge funds are initiating stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) amid signs that the Chinese ecommerce retailer could rebound in the near future. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) recently denied rumors circulating in the media that it was planning to cut 20% of its workforce. Instead, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) plans to hire 15,000 people this year, according to a report from Reuters. Earlier in May Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) posted its fiscal Q4 results. Adjusted EPADS for the fourth quarter came in at $1.56, beating estimates by $0.21. Revenue jumped 2% year over year to $30.32 billion, beating estimates by $410 million.128 hedge funds reported stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) at the end of March, up from 117 funds at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.L1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long +16%) shares performed strongly based on favourable sentiment surrounding China’s re-opening and indications from Chinese authorities that the prolonged restructuring process of Alibaba/Ant Financial was finally drawing to a close. The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organisational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Perhaps no list of top blue chip stocks could be complete without Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Insider Monkey’s database of 943 funds shows that 131 hedge funds had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)at the end of the March quarter. Warren Buffett has an eye-popping $151 billion stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Year to date Apple shares have gained about 38% through May 26.However, Loop Capital recently cut its rating for Apple, citing data that suggests Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has slashed its iPhone shipment estimates for the second quarter. Nonetheless the firm made no changes to its $180 price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is still up from the May 26 stock price of around $173.Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology provider in telecommunications, computing, and services. Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives particularly tight engagement with consumers and enterprises, which is fostering the growing purchase of high margin services like music, apps, and Apple Pay. While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives. Aside from production disruptions, negative sentiment had also weighed on shares as investors questioned how an economic slowdown would affect consumer demand for Apple products in 2023. However, management projected an acceleration in earnings for the fiscal first quarter, where they noted that iPhone and services growth should remain strong, along with encouraging impacts around product mix, lower input costs, and continued cost controls.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132It seems hedge funds had foresight on things to come for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as they upped their bets on the stock in the first quarter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares recently posted unprecedented gains and the company flirted with $1 trillion valuation after a spectacular revenue guidance fueled by AI-related demand.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers. Management’s constructive assessment of 2023 prospects. coupled with the rapid rollout and adoption of generative Al offerings, led to positive share price performance.”8. salesforce.com, inc.

Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.""7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Payments giant Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)  in April posted strong Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.80, beating estimates by $0.09.

When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size.

(NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 15 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
27,5727de15-876c-3d6c-9bc1-89bb2789a77e,PSX,2023-05-29,Phillips 66's (NYSE:PSX) investors will be pleased with their favorable 39% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66s-nyse-psx-investors-143806224.html,1685284686,STORY,['PSX'],"[Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. For example, the Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) share price return of 21% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 6.7% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Phillips 66 was able to grow its EPS at 220% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 7% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 3.51 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Phillips 66's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Phillips 66 the TSR over the last 3 years was 39%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectivePhillips 66 shareholders are down 2.8% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 1.0%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.3% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Phillips 66  that you should be aware of.Phillips 66 is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

28,44501bd2-cb57-3b9e-a1dd-8b29237c4038,AMGN,2023-05-29,Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) underlying earnings growth outpaced the notable return generated for shareholders over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgens-nasdaq-amgn-underlying-earnings-120020198.html,1685361620,STORY,['AMGN'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 17% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 15% in the last year.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.2%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 37% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 3% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Amgen will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Amgen the TSR over the last 5 years was 36%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmgen shareholders are down 12% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 1.0%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.The stock market turmoil caused by rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies didn’t see an end in 2023. Amid uncertainty, the demand for stable, mature and reliable stocks increased. That’s why major, large-cap companies are clearly beating small-cap stocks this year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 7.3% year to date, while The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 was down 3.3%, as of May 16. A recent WSJ report quoted data from Dow Jones Market Data which showed that this spread of 10.6% percentage points shows the S&amp;P 500's biggest outperformance through May 16 since 2020.Hedge funds are also upping their bets on blue chip stocks. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds updated to reflect the Q1 portfolios shows that major blue chip companies remain popular among the elite hedge funds in the US. Technology sector remains the most favorite area to invest in for smart money investors.Why Invest in Blue Chip Stocks?However Raymond James said in its primer on blue chip stocks that these equities are not the go-to options for growth investors. However, the reliability and dividend income that is promised by several major blue chip stocks make these stocks attractive for investors. Here's how Raymond James explains the lure of blue chip stocks:Clearly, blue chips are unlikely candidates for growth investors seeking above average returns in a short period of time. But blue often possess understated value that could make them a superior investment over time. One of the chief advantages of blue chips is their dual investment value. As equities, their share price appreciates with earnings growth, albeit at a lower rate than a growth stock. Then there’s the dividend income which most blue chips are likely to payout to investors. Over the long term, the combination of gradual stock price appreciation and regular dividend income (made all the more attractive if there is a dividend re-investment program), can give blue chip investments a very reasonable long-term rate of return.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 blue chip stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds15.

(NYSE:JPM) was perhaps one of the biggest beneficiaries of the regional banking collapse seen earlier this year as people withdrew their funds from smaller banks and flocked to large banks like JPMorgan. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up about 4% over the past one year. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is also a dividend payer. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1 per share, which is payable on July 31 for shareholders on record as of July 6.A total of 112 hedge funds had stakes in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”11. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Hedge funds are initiating stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) amid signs that the Chinese ecommerce retailer could rebound in the near future. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) recently denied rumors circulating in the media that it was planning to cut 20% of its workforce.

The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organisational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”10. Apple Inc.

While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives. Aside from production disruptions, negative sentiment had also weighed on shares as investors questioned how an economic slowdown would affect consumer demand for Apple products in 2023. However, management projected an acceleration in earnings for the fiscal first quarter, where they noted that iPhone and services growth should remain strong, along with encouraging impacts around product mix, lower input costs, and continued cost controls.”9.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers.

Insider Monkey’s database shows that 144 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of March, up from 135 funds in the previous quarter.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 15 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

35,82bf89b2-1034-353b-915e-c0ccc36ecb18,JNJ,2023-05-29,Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-nyse-jnj-seems-120054437.html,1685361654,STORY,['JNJ'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson What Is Johnson &amp; Johnson's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of April 2023 Johnson &amp; Johnson had US$52.9b of debt, an increase on US$33.1b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$24.6b, its net debt is less, at about US$28.3b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Johnson &amp; Johnson's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Johnson &amp; Johnson had liabilities of US$60.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$64.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$24.6b in cash and US$16.4b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$84.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesOf course, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a titanic market capitalization of US$431.8b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Johnson &amp; Johnson has net debt of just 0.85 times EBITDA, suggesting it could ramp leverage without breaking a sweat. And remarkably, despite having net debt, it actually received more in interest over the last twelve months than it had to pay. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. Fortunately, Johnson &amp; Johnson grew its EBIT by 3.9% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Johnson &amp; Johnson's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Johnson &amp; Johnson recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Johnson &amp; Johnson's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Johnson &amp; Johnson seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Johnson &amp; Johnson   you should know about.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

36,9a921f30-4609-328e-a130-d22c6ba14e81,JNJ,2023-05-29,ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-stock-portfolio-top-10-150929797.html,1685286569,STORY,"['NVDA', 'JNJ', 'BRK-B', 'KO', 'HD', 'MMM', 'PG', 'ORCL']","[In this article, we will take a look at ChatGPT stock portfolio. To see more such companies, go directly to ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.If there’s one thing that can be learned from literally hundreds of ChatGPT-related posts out there claiming that the AI chatbot has successfully beaten the market, it’s that ChatGPT’s responses show huge variance based on the input it receives and one should learn to enjoy and benefit from the diversity of possibilities offered by AI. In January this year, people at Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to make an ETF to beat the US stock market. ChatGPT gave nothing in return but the age-old cliché statement to the effect of “past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns” and that it’s not possible to beat the market for it due to massive volatility.But many experts were able to force ChatGPT to blurt out a list of stocks by asking it to act as an expert stock adviser. To check out some stocks recommended by ChatGPT, see our article published back in March where we asked ChatGPT to pick stocks that have the potential to make investors rich.Investors have been toying with the idea of using AI to beat the market for quite some time now. Back in 2021, when Sam Altman’s OpenAI was perhaps getting ready to unleash the market-moving, earth-shattering thing that is ChatGPT, Bloomberg had reported that researchers at the University of Oxford claimed they have come up with a machine learning model with a capability to predict stock price movements. They claimed that the model posted a whopping 80% success rate for the equivalent of about 30 seconds of live trading.The Bloomberg report at the time said that the researchers, who were backed by the UK-based Man Group, used natural-language processing algorithms to process trading data. The report said that the algorithm managed to predict the future trajectory of a price over a period of 100 ticks.The Buzzword GameWe’ll take a detailed look at whether or not AI is good at stock picking but one thing is for sure: AI has a huge impact on the stock markets, so much so that many investors are comparing the AI-driven stock market gains to the ones seen in the crypto markets and during the dot-com era. Just look at what’s happening at companies’ earnings calls. Companies are repeatedly using buzzwords like “generative AI”, “large language models”, “artificial intelligence”, etc. during their earnings call and shareholder meetings. Bloomberg in a report quoted interesting data points which show that the use of the word “artificial intelligence” jumped a whopping 85% during earnings calls. There’s a reason why everyone is talking about AI. Whenever a company announces plans to somehow deploy AI in its operations, its stock price jumps. Even non-tech companies like Wendy’s enjoyed stock price gains when they announced plans to cut costs using AI.Story continuesWhat's Happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?But what’s happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strange and highly unprecedented. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares skyrocketed by 25% on May 25 after the company posted solid quarterly results and gave a revenue guidance of $11 billion for the second quarter, shocking Wall Street analysts who have a $7.2 billion estimate for the metric. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s guided revenue is up 64% from the year-ago period, and comes on the huge demand fueled by the widespread use of applications like ChatGPT.Dan Ives of Wedbus commented on this development:""In 22 years of covering tech stocks and large cap we have never seen a guidance range of this magnitude on a large cap tech name…And thus speaks to our thesis that the monetization of AI for stalwarts like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is well underway.""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s management during the company’s Q4 earnings call was already pointing to the huge potential coming from the generative AI space. Here’s what the company’s CEO Jensen Huang had said:""The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most. Today, I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service — cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world’s largest clouds.NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world’s most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world’s most advanced clouds.

NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP and others on the way.ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 10 PicksPhoto by Andrea De Santis on UnsplashOur MethodologyComparison website Finder.com asked ChatGPT to create a portfolio of stocks to beat some of the most popular funds in the UK, including Fundsmith, Vanguard LifeStrategy 100% Equity A Acc, Vanguard LifeStrategy 80% Equity A Acc, Vanguard FTSE Glb All Cp Idx £ Acc, among others.

These were presented as late-breaking science at Heart Rhythm 2023 in New Orleans. The results confirm that the system provides the advantages of a device with lead outside the heart and continues to provide pause prevention pacing and anti-tachycardia pacing to avoid shocks with prolonged follow-ups.By providing a contemporary view of the real-world impact of ICDs, the EV ICD study underscores the importance of indicated patients receiving these potentially life-saving devices.About the EV ICD SystemThe Medtronic EV ICD system is an implantable defibrillator, which is designed to treat dangerously fast heart rhythms that can lead to sudden cardiac arrests. This is the first system that offers anti-tachycardia pacing, pause prevention pacing, and a device similar in size, shape and battery longevity to transvenous ICDs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStudy FindingsOf the 299 implanted patients followed through an average of 17.1 months, an estimated 6.8% of patients showed to have experienced appropriate therapy by 18 months, with 19 patients experiencing 80 spontaneous, appropriately treated arrhythmic episodes. Of the discrete episodes treated with shock, 100% were successfully terminated.The rate of freedom from major EV ICD system-or-procedure-related complications through 18 months was 91.9%. The most common major complication was lead dislodgment, identified within 120 days post-implant, mostly related to the lead-anchoring technique. Inappropriate shocks occurred in 35 patients throughout all follow-ups.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global implantable cardioverter defibrillator market size was valued at $3.3 billion and is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.3% up to 2030.Recent DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for its Micra AV2 and Micra VR2 — the next generation of its industry-leading miniaturized, leadless pacemakers. The world's smallest pacemakers provide longer battery life and easier programming than prior Micra pacemakers, while delivering the expanded benefits of leadless pacing compared to traditional pacemakers.Story continuesIn April 2023, Medtronic announced the FDA approval of its MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor, which requires no fingerstick while in SmartGuard technology. This milestone marks the approval of the only system with meal detection technology that provides automatic adjustments and corrections to sugar levels every five minutes.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, MDT shares have increased 10.1% compared with the industry’s rise of 5.8%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Penumbra PEN, Lantheus LNTH and Neuronetics STIM.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber. View our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 5.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP are the second and third largest shareholders.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Goodyear Tire &amp; RubberThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around US$23m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Both COMAC and China hope the new plane can compete with Boeing's 737 Max and Airbus's A320, helping break the decades-long duopoly held by the two commercial aviation giants.The C919's first flight has been a long time coming for COMAC. The company first announced the plane in 2007, but production delays pushed the first test flight to 2017. Chinese regulators only approved the plane for commercial passenger operations last September. COMAC delivered the first plane to China Eastern in December 2022.China Eastern now expects to put the C919 into regular commercial service, including a route between Shanghai and Chengdu, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province.C919 fits into Beijing strategy of self-sufficiencyBeijing hopes the C919 proves that its strategy to build up domestic firms in high-end manufacturing and technology—not just in aerospace but also sectors like semiconductors, renewable energy, and electric vehicles—is paying off.Worsening U.S.-China tensions, as well as U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China, have made Beijing's effort of self-sufficiency more urgent. COMAC's new plane will help the country withstand the U.S.’s “high-tech containment strategy,"" argued an editorial from state-run outlet Global Times earlier this year.Story continuesYet production of the C919 will be slow. While COMAC says it has received over 1,200 orders for the new jet, it only expects to be able to produce 150 planes domestically a year by 2028. By comparison, Airbus and Boeing delivered 661 and 480 planes respectively last year.Earlier efforts to break up Boeing-Airbus duopolySeveral other companies have tried, and failed, to challenge Boeing and Airbus’s dominance. In 2018, Canada-based Bombardier ceded control of the CSeries, its most recent commercial plane, to Airbus. Then, in February of this year, Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi abandoned its 15-year plan to create a regional jet.Yet Chinese government support could give the C919 a potential advantage, as Chinese airlines—several of which are state-run—order the plane to support COMAC. Those orders might hurt Boeing and Airbus, both of which have sold hundreds of planes to Chinese airlines.Boeing's struggles in ChinaBoeing, in particular, has not yet rebounded from its 737 Max debacle in China. Beijing grounded the plane in March 2019 after the Boeing model was involved in two high-profile accidents, and only re-approved the plane for flight in December 2021. Even then, the 737 Max did not return to China’s skies until January. Chinese carriers have started to shift their allegiance to Airbus over Boeing.In 2021, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury predicted that COMAC might be able to capture market share from Boeing and Airbus when it comes to single-aisle planes (like Airbus’s A320), creating a “triopoly"" by the end of the decade.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

(NYSE:NKE) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-nike-inc-nyse-123620440.html,1685277380,STORY,['NKE'],"[NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase NIKE's shares on or after the 2nd of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of July.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.34 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.36 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, NIKE has a trailing yield of approximately 1.3% on its current stock price of $107.51. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether NIKE's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for NIKE Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately NIKE's payout ratio is modest, at just 37% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (52%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see NIKE earnings per share are up 6.9% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, NIKE has increased its dividend at approximately 14% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineShould investors buy NIKE for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and NIKE paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. Overall, it's hard to get excited about NIKE from a dividend perspective.Ever wonder what the future holds for NIKE?

Nope. 3 Stocks to Buy Now.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sell-may-away-nope-3-175127786.html,1684950687,STORY,"['WFC', 'CRM', 'AMZN']","[This time of year it’s rare to hear anyone talking about stocks to buy in May. Instead the opposite “sell in May and go away” makes its rounds in the media, the latest round of alarm-sounding. It’s not a completely unfounded piece of advice— data does confirm that the market tends to perform better in the first part of the year compared to the second. But dig a little deeper and you’ll see that trying to time the market has been proven to be a poor strategy at any time of the year.The result of these conflicting theories is simple, and it’s a strategy that investors should use all year round, not just in May. Pick quality stocks, and if you can, get them on sale. While the herd is battening down the hatches for the dreaded May slump, you might be able to pick up a few opportunities that turn into long-term winners.So how do you find top stocks to buy now? On a macro level, you should be looking for businesses that can weather a storm. Economic uncertainty is rife, so businesses with a strong value proposition, sticky customers, and a solid balance sheet are a good place to start your search. Growth potential is another key factor when it comes to finding undervalued stocks— if they can weather an economic storm, can they come out the other side ready to skyrocket? Sometimes it’s as simple as looking at beaten-down stocks and judging whether the market is overreacting. This can be the case if a company is suffering from repetitional damage, or is part of a sector that’s currently out of favor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, here are three stocks to buy in May if you’re not bothered about taking financial advice from a rhyme.Stocks to buy in May: Salesforce.com (CRM)The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThere’s no getting around the fact that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been struggling with decelerating revenue growth. The group’s customer relationship management software has become a staple for big businesses undergoing a digital transformation. Unsurprisingly, budgets are getting stretched and that’s meant that selling productivity software has become much harder. Plus, competition from other big players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is making it harder to bring in new customers.Story continuesBut the group’s still growing the top line, and now that it’s no longer shooting the lights out, margins are the focus. This is a natural part of a maturing business model— at some point the market is saturated, and you have to find new things to sell to people or make the ones you’re selling cheaper to make. That’s what CRM is focused on now, with cost-cutting initiatives that saw some 10% of its workforce cut. CRM’s also got two activist investors breathing down its neck, so maximizing shareholder value is likely to be a key priority moving forward.Salesforce believes there are several more opportunities to improve efficiency. It’s expecting margins to expand from 22.5% to 27% in 2024. If it can meet that guidance, investors would benefit.Wells Fargo (WFC)A Wells Fargo (WFC) sign hangs on a brick building in Bloomfield, Connecticut.Source: Martina Badini / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has had a tough few years, but with the fallout from its fake account scandal nearly in the rearview, the group looks like a good pick among stocks to buy in May. Like most of its peers, Wells Fargo was impacted by the banking crisis as investor sentiment weakened in the financial sector. Shares are down about 13% over the past six months.But WFC is incredibly well-capitalized. The group more than meets regulatory requirements for the quality of its assets, which offers a layer of insulation even as uncertainty looms. It’s enough that the bank’s been buying back shares and is likely to continue doing so in the year ahead. The Fed’s set to conduct another banking sector stress test, which could mean capital requirements are tightened. But even so, Wells Fargo’s sizeable buffer means management has far more room to maneuver than some of its peers.Its latest earnings also showed healthy profit growth— so the bank looks to be just about as healthy as you can be in this environment. But the real draw for WFC shares is that their value doesn’t reflect its strong position, making it a worthwhile pick among top stocks to buy now.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a favorite among buy-and-hold investors, but given it’s trading at pre-pandemic levels it makes for a good choice among stocks to buy in May. Notably, Amazon’s share price decline isn’t necessarily unfounded. After all, rising interest rates mean the value of a dollar in 10 years’ time is a lot less than it once was. Mathematically, that means investors are willing to pay less for Amazon’s future profits.But some of the sell-off is overdone. Amazon’s growth story is still strong. The group’s cloud arm is still a strong selling point— with the overall market expected to continue expanding and Amazon’s AWS planted firmly at the front of it. The group’s also building out its presence in advertising, which should stand it in good stead as budgets dwindle.Advertisers will be choosier about where they direct their funds, and capturing the attention of consumers already primed and ready to click buy is hard to turn down.On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In.Generative AI will perhaps be the most dominant and consequential buzzword of not only 2023 but this decade. Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to produce new and original content — text, photos, videos — based on human input.The magnitude of investment opportunities unlocked by the advances in generative AI is huge. Major companies like Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, among many others, are already drooling over the countless applications of generative AI.A report by Rockefeller Insights quotes data from a Bloomberg report which says in 2022 alone investors poured a whopping $2.6 billion in 110 unique generative AI-focused startups in the US. Keep in mind that ChatGPT was launched near the end of 2022 and that’s when the term generative AI really started to take off on the mainstream internet. Generative AI is a key component of the global AI market which according to data quoted in the Rockefeller report is estimated to reach a massive $900 billion in value by 2026, growing at a CAGR of about 19% from the current levels.Real-word studies quantifying the impact of generative AI have started to pour in. One such study was done by researchers at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the study, about 5,000 customer service agents at a Fortune 500 company were separated in two groups, one with access to AI-trained generative AI tools and the other without any such tools. Results showed that the group with access to generative AI tools was 14% more productive than the other group.""Huge Reckoning""Like industrial revolution, the AI revolution will affect almost every facet of human civilization. Its effects are already visible. From education to labor markets, from food industry to entertainment, it seems like everyone will have to adapt, adjust, evolve or learn to thrive or at least survive in the AI age. In a new video series dubbed AI IRL, Bloomberg sheds light on how generative AI is affecting universities. Bloomberg quotes Andrea Jones-Rooy, a professor of data science at New York University, who thinks that education is going to have a “huge reckoning” because of this new technology.Story continues“We get more emails about generative AI than we got in the early days of Covid when everything was shutting down.""The professor also thinks universities will have reconsider their teaching methodologies and course design.“We can't keep telling ourselves that we're here to teach them how to do code or have these tangible skills because you can teach yourself all of those things,’’ Andrea Jones-Rooy added.Another area where generative AI and AI in general is and will make waves is the travel industry. Talking to Bloomberg, Choice Hotels CIO Brian Kirkland said that his company was already using AI before the buzzword generative AI surfaced. He said the company uses AI-powered systems to process and analyze data about trends, inventory management, customer satisfaction, best possible hotel deals, revenue management and more. Top 5 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest InImage by Alexandra_Koch from PixabayOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of The Generative AI ETF by Roundhill Investments (CHAT) and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. We gauged hedge fund using Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Top 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In10. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49At its annual Think Conference, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) recently revealed several AI offerings including those related to generative AI. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM)’s products and services will allow developers to build and optimize their AI applications. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) Cloud Carbon Calculator, for example, is an “AI-informed” dashboard that enables customers to measure, track, manage and report carbon emissions generated through their cloud usage.International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) also revealed WatsonX, its AI-related platform that will offer various solutions in the related segment. There are three components of the platform. The Watsonx.ai studio component will be for  generative AI and machine learning applications.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM).9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91While everyone is talking about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) these days when it comes to chips for generative AI industry, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shouldn’t be ignored since the company has shown in the past how quickly it can catch-up when it comes to competing with giants like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is the fourth largest holding of the The Generative AI ETF by Roundhill Investments. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) earlier this year revealed some Accelerated Processing Units that are used to power super computers.  It’s also reported that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s MI200 was used to train Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure for large-scale training data.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CEO Lisa Su extensively talked about the company’s AI capabilities in AMD’s latest earnings call:""We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history. And as the recent interest in generative AI highlights, bringing the benefits of large language models and other AI capabilities to cloud, edge and endpoints require significant increases in compute performance.AMD is very well positioned to capitalize on this increased demand to compute based on our broad portfolio of high-performance and adaptive compute engines, the deep relationships we have established with customers across a diverse set of large markets, and our expanding software capabilities. We are very excited about our opportunity in AI. This is our #1 strategic priority, and we are engaging deeply across our customer set to bring joint solutions to the market, led by our upcoming instinct MI300 GPUs, Ryzen 7040 Series CPUs with Ryzen AI, Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, LVO V70 data center inference accelerators and Versal AI adaptive data center and edge SoCs. I look forward to sharing more about our AI progress over the coming quarters as we broaden our portfolio and grow the strategic part of our business.""8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is taking the generative AI game to the next level by making the technology accessible to millions of users of its flagship product, Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently revealed Adobe Fill, a technology that allows users to edit photos using text-based input. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is also rolling out several AI capabilities in its famous Adobe Sensei platform.A total of 99 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 943 funds reported owning stakes in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as of the end of the first quarter. The biggest stakeholder of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which had a $732 million stake in the company.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a major player in the Cloud computing industry. The company plans to use this position to expand its offerings in generative AI. In April Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) revealed plans to integrate its large language model, “Tongyi Qianwen”, across several of its products and services.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) accounts for about 2.69% of the total portfolio of The Generative AI ETF by Roundhill Investments.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 128 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). The biggest stakeholder of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was Panayotis Takis Sparaggis’s Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $472 million stake in the company.L1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long +16%) shares performed strongly based on favourable sentiment surrounding China’s re-opening and indications from Chinese authorities that the prolonged restructuring process of Alibaba/Ant Financial was finally drawing to a close. The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organisational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the biggest winner in the AI boom. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s market cap reached close to $1 trillion recently after its shares jumped following a solid quarterly report and guidance, fueled by a huge demand for chips that are designed for AI applications. In an interview with CNBC, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO called generative AI a “flashpoint” for the company.“The flashpoint was generative AI. We know that CPU scaling has slowed, we know that accelerated computing is the path forward, and then the killer app showed up.”As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 132 hedge funds reported owning stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The biggest stakeholder of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) during this period was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.3 billion stake in the company.Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers. Management’s constructive assessment of 2023 prospects. coupled with the rapid rollout and adoption of generative Al offerings, led to positive share price performance.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In. Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None.

51,d859bd8b-bab1-3adb-b6cd-d86e682939cf,IBM,2023-05-29,Does International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-international-business-machines-nyse-140012374.html,1685282412,STORY,['IBM'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines What Is International Business Machines's Debt?As you can see below, at the end of March 2023, International Business Machines had US$58.5b of debt, up from US$54.1b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$17.4b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.1b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is International Business Machines' Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, International Business Machines had liabilities of US$31.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$81.0b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$17.4b as well as receivables valued at US$6.99b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$87.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesThis deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$117.0b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on International Business Machines' use of debt. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.With net debt to EBITDA of 3.2 International Business Machines has a fairly noticeable amount of debt. But the high interest coverage of 8.4 suggests it can easily service that debt. It is well worth noting that International Business Machines's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 31% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine International Business Machines's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, International Business Machines actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Our ViewHappily, International Business Machines's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. All these things considered, it appears that International Business Machines can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

52,73182765-7026-35bc-892b-fbfe06990908,MPC,2023-05-29,Could The Market Be Wrong About Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-marathon-petroleum-145009211.html,1685285409,STORY,['MPC'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) recent performance, when its stock has declined 14% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Marathon Petroleum's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marathon Petroleum is:53% = US$18b ÷ US$34b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.53 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Marathon Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 53% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Marathon Petroleum has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 33% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Marathon Petroleum's exceptional 29% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesWe then compared Marathon Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 22% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MPC fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Marathon Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Marathon Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 8.4%, meaning that it has the remaining 92% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Marathon Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Besides, Marathon Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 36% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 12% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Marathon Petroleum's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

53,3e8342bf-5e39-30e1-aa0c-3c0b0c36455f,GM,2023-05-29,7 EV Stocks With the Most Potential to Go the Distance,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-ev-stocks-most-potential-010520311.html,1684976720,STORY,"['GM', 'TSLA', 'CHPT', 'STLAM.MI', 'HTZ', 'TM']","[While electric vehicles may dominate the roadways of the future, their general underperformance since the beginning of 2022 has clouded the narrative of EV stocks with high potential. To be sure, the dramatic rise of competition in the arena most likely won’t be sustainable. Unlike what your kindergarten teacher told you, everybody can’t be a winner.Still, it’s a massive market so targeting the top EV stocks to buy should be well worth the time for patient investors. According to Grand View Research, the global EV sector may reach a valuation of $1.21 trillion by 2027. And we’re not just talking about the vehicles themselves but several secondary and tertiary segments, such as charging stations and rental car outlets. Plus, with the red ink in the sector at the moment, contrarian market participants could pick up serious discounts. So, investing in EV stocks may be lucrative if you’re willing to plug your nose for a bit.TSLATesla$182.90GMGeneral Motors$32.28TMToyota$139.33HTZHertz Global$15.82STLAStellantis$15.74CHPTChargePoint$8.36LCIDLucid Group$7.49InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTesla (TSLA)Interior of the Tesla Model 3Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comI want to be clear when mentioning Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the EV stocks with high potential: I’m speaking purely from a long-term perspective. Fundamentally, I have major concerns about TSLA in the short to intermediate term. Yes, shares gained about 72% in the year so far. However, in the trailing year, it’s still in negative territory, down more than 11%.Overall, I’m not liking the lack of momentum in the charts. However, if we’re talking about betting on which of the top EV stocks to buy will still be traded a decade from now, TSLA offers a reasonably safe wager. Back in 2021, InsideEVs mentioned that Tesla gained massive brand value. Today, it’s possible that the company achieved irreversible brand awareness.Unlike failed automotive companies that have cult appeal – read DeLorean Motor Company – Tesla has become ingrained in the mainstream. It’s almost to the point where Tesla has become synonymous with personal electric transportation. Unless you know something that others don’t, Tesla is one of the long-term EV stocks that can go the distance.Story continuesGeneral Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logoSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to EV stocks with high potential, I’d be remiss not to mention General Motors (NYSE:GM). If I’m being perfectly honest, I’d wager that GM has the ability to go an even longer distance than Tesla. Sure, the latter enjoys an incredible social cachet, as mentioned earlier. However, GM represents an American icon. It’s for the working people while also providing exciting vehicles for wealthier enthusiasts (read the eighth-generation Corvette).Fundamentally, for average American drivers to make the transition to electrification, they’re likelier to trust established brands like GM. And that’s exactly what Green Car Reports noted one year ago. Shoppers are more likely to trust the legacy automakers than even Tesla, let alone a new EV manufacturer like Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN).However, the problem back then – and probably nothing changed in just a year’s time – centered on a lack of product excitement. It’s still a new field so the lack of enticing products is understandable. Fortunately for GM, it can leverage some of its most popular models and convert them for electrification. Therefore, GM is well worth consideration for anyone interested in investing in EV stocks.Toyota (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comTo be fair, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been an oddball in the field of EV stocks with high potential. Known for its hybrid approach to green-friendly transportation (read Prius), the Japanese automaker hasn’t fully embraced electrification with gusto until more recently. For instance, in late 2022, The Wall Street Journal ran a story about then-CEO Akio Toyoda and his doubts about the auto industry pursuing an EV-only approach.However, Toyota’s new chief executive is Koji Sato and he calls for the automaker to pursue an EV-first mindset. “We need to drastically change how we do business,” remarked Sato. Given Toyota’s remarkable success in consistently becoming one of the top auto manufacturers in the world, investors shouldn’t doubt TM’s upside narrative. Thus, it’s one of the top EV stocks to buy.To be fair, Toyota’s acceleration into electrification lags many of its competitors. Nevertheless, the trust associated with legacy firms should apply exponentially to Toyota. As practically everybody knows, the company garnered a strong reputation for quality and reliability. So, it’s a comfortable pick among long-term EV stocks.Hertz (HTZ)Source: ShutterstockRepresenting one of the more remarkable turnarounds in business history, Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic became a tragic symbol of the global crisis. Through no fault of its own, the SARS-CoV-2 virus temporarily shut down non-essential travel. Incurring a catastrophic loss of demand, the WSJ reported that the company filed for bankruptcy in May 2020.Today, you can make the argument that Hertz represents one of the long-term EV stocks to buy. No, it’s obviously not a direct player in the burgeoning electrification market. However, it does provide a critical ancillary service. By renting out vehicles to travelers, it can help accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility through its EV portfolio.In March of last year, Electrek noted that Hertz added the Tesla Model Y to its fleet following a massive deal for 100,000 Model 3s. Because consumers nowadays prefer SUVs over sedans – heck, even I had to make the transition to SUVs following my longstanding love affair with two-seaters – the deal should be immensely beneficial for both Hertz and Tesla. Thus, it’s one of the EV stocks with high potential.Stellantis (STLA)A flag with the logo for Stellantis waves outside a building with the logos for some of its car brands, including Abarth, Lancia, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep.Source: Antonello Marangi / Shutterstock.comA multinational automotive manufacturing corporation, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) materialized as a 50–50 cross-border merger between the Italian-American conglomerate Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the French PSA Group, per its public profile. Under the Stellantis umbrella stand several compelling brands, including Alfa Romeo, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, and Peugeot to name but a few. As electrification becomes a reality for all, Stellantis enjoys lucrative conversion opportunities.Enticingly, STLA makes for one of the EV stocks with high potential thanks to Stellantis’ upcoming 2024 Dodge Charger EV. You read that right. Dodge is going to take its iconic Charger muscle car and make it whirr (instead of rumble) down the dragstrip. To be sure, the Charger EV will carry an amplifying chamber “exhaust” tuned to 126 decibels.Honestly, muscle car aficionados represent a hard-to-please crowd so the Charger EV might not resonate with them. Guess what? That’s not the main consumer. Instead, I’m almost certain that Stellantis aims to attract younger folks who yearn for unapologetically masculine cars while still being environmentally responsible. Watch this space.ChargePoint (CHPT)EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.Source: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.comWe can’t talk about EV stock with high potential without mentioning companies specializing in infrastructure. Thankfully for the burgeoning industry, the segment has increased in scope and competition. That said, ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) may be able to rise above the fray thanks to its vast coverage network and awareness. In addition, the company makes inroads regarding commercial and fleet partnerships.From a technical performance perspective, CHPT appears relatively stable, with the keyword being “relatively.” Since the Jan. opener, CHPT slipped nearly 7%. In the trailing one-year period, shares tumbled more than 18%. Of course, these aren’t sterling figures. However, some EV charging stocks have suffered losses of more than 55% during the past 365 days.Financially, ChargePoint could definitely use some work, let’s keep this discussion real. As with other EV charging companies, profitability challenges cloud the segment. However, ChargePoint also features a three-year revenue growth rate of 38.5%, which is quite impressive. Overall, it’s one of the long-term EV stocks for speculators.Lucid Group (LCID)Someone is viewing a red Lucid Air car on a computer screen while holding a phone that says LucidSource: T. Schneider / ShutterstockEasily one of the riskiest ideas for those interested in investing in EV stocks, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) embarked on a mission to take on Tesla. Initially, the backdrop appeared favorable. Commanding world-class engineers along with a sense of style, Lucid immediately distinguished itself from Tesla, which generally features the same design language throughout its various models. Thus, Lucid appeared to have an edge regarding the consumer excitement angle.Unfortunately, circumstances have not panned out well for Lucid. For its first quarter of 2023 earnings call, Lucid revealed ongoing disappointments regarding serious production shortfalls. As well, its deliveries encountered headwinds in 2022. Therefore, LCID stock gave up almost 56% of its equity value in the trailing one-year period.Still, it’s not all bad news. As Electrek pointed out, management stated that it still had 28,000 unfulfilled EV reservations. If Lucid can fill all of them, we’re talking about roughly $2.7 billion in revenue. Also, the company reported total liquidity of $4.9 billion, indicating that the EV maker has enough capital to maintain operations through at least Q1 2024. Granted, it’s a high-risk, high-reward wager. However, it could be one of the EV stocks with high potential once it works out the cobwebs.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The dividend yield will be 4.1% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Navient Navient's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Navient's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 11.7% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 19%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendNavient Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.50, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.64. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.5% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Navient has grown earnings per share at 26% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Navient Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Navient might even raise payments in the future. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Visa (NYSE:V). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Visa How Fast Is Visa Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Visa managed to grow EPS by 11% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Visa remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 15% to US$31b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Visa's forecast profits?Are Visa Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$461b company like Visa. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$231m. This comes in at 0.05% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesDoes Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Visa is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Visa that you need to take into consideration.Although Visa certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230527005021/en/The new engine connects an ecosystem of 3D design, manufacturing and creative supply chain tools, including those from Adobe and Getty Images, letting WPP’s artists and designers integrate 3D content creation with generative AI. This enables WPP's clients to reach consumers in highly personalized and engaging ways, while preserving the quality, accuracy and fidelity of their company’s brand identity, products and logos.NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the engine in a demo during his COMPUTEX keynote address, illustrating how clients can work with teams at WPP, the world’s largest marketing services organization, to make large volumes of brand advertising content such as images or videos and experiences like 3D product configurators more tailored and immersive.""The world’s industries, including the $700 billion digital advertising industry, are racing to realize the benefits of AI,"" Huang said. ""With Omniverse Cloud and generative AI tools, WPP is giving brands the ability to build and deploy product experiences and compelling content at a level of realism and scale never possible before.""""Generative AI is changing the world of marketing at incredible speed,"" said Mark Read, CEO of WPP. ""Our partnership with NVIDIA gives WPP a unique competitive advantage through an AI solution that is available to clients nowhere else in the market today. This new technology will transform the way that brands create content for commercial use, and cements WPP’s position as the industry leader in the creative application of AI for the world’s top brands.""Story continuesAn Engine for CreativityThe new content engine has at its foundation Omniverse Cloud — a platform for connecting 3D tools, and developing and operating industrial digitalization applications. This allows WPP to seamlessly connect its supply chain of product-design data from software such as Adobe’s Substance 3D tools for 3D and immersive content creation, plus computer-aided design tools to create brand-accurate, photoreal digital twins of client products.WPP uses responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from partners such as Adobe and Getty Images so its designers can create varied, high-fidelity images from text prompts and bring them into scenes. This includes Adobe Firefly, a family of creative generative AI models, and exclusive visual content from Getty Images created using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design.With the final scenes, creative teams can render large volumes of brand-accurate, 2D images and videos for classic advertising, or publish interactive 3D product configurators to NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network, a worldwide, graphics streaming network, for consumers to experience on any web device.In addition to speed and efficiency, the new engine outperforms current methods, which require creatives to manually create hundreds of thousands of pieces of content using disparate data coming from disconnected tools and systems.The partnership with NVIDIA builds on WPP’s existing leadership position in emerging technologies and generative AI, with award-winning campaigns for major clients around the world.The new content engine will soon be available exclusively to WPP’s clients around the world.About WPPWPP is the creative transformation company.

One exaflop has the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.Shainer said AI was the ""most important technology in our lifetime"" and that to develop AI and generative AI applications large graphics processing units (GPUs) were needed.""Generative AI is going everywhere nowadays. You need to be able to run training on large datasets,"" he told Reuters, noting companies in Israel will have access to a supercomputer they don't have today.""This system is a large scale system that actually will enable them to do training much quicker, to build frameworks and build solutions that can tackle more complex problems.""OpenAI's ChatGPT, for example, was created with thousands of Nvidia GPUs.The system was developed by the former Mellanox team. Nvidia bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies in 2019 for nearly $7 billion, outbidding Intel Corp.Shainer said Nvidia's first priority for the supercomputer was its Israeli partners. ""We may use this system to work with partners outside of Israel down the road,"" he said.Last week, Nvidia said it had worked with Britain's University of Bristol to build a new supercomputer using a new Nvidia chip that would compete with Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.(Reporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home “There was excitement about A.I., and Nvidia ratified that excitement with blowout earnings,” Siegel said on CNBC on Monday.Shares in Nvidia surged by over 24% on Thursday after the chipmaker surprised analysts by forecasting $11 billion in sales for the current quarter, much higher than expected. The jump in share prices increased Nvidia’s market capitalization by $184 billion. And it was more than just Nvidia: A.I. stocks added $300 billion in value on Thursday, according to Reuters, as investors plunged into companies working on the new technology.By market close Friday, Nvidia’s market cap had risen to over $960 billion, bringing it close to the $1 trillion threshold now held by just four U.S. companies: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.While admitting that A.I.-related stocks may be “slightly overvalued” in the long-term, Siegel noted that in the short-term “momentum can carry stocks far higher than their fundamental value, and no one can predict how high they might go.”The A.I.-fueled boom is “not a bubble yet,” he said.He contrasted Nvidia’s jump in share price to earlier bubbles, like the dotcom bubble. During the late Nineties, “we were getting tremendous valuations from companies that had no earnings,” he said, unlike Nvidia, which he characterized as a “real, good company.”Nvidia reported a record $4.58 billion in revenue from its data center business last quarter, a record high for the division that’s closely connected to the growth in generative A.I. and machine learning. The company reported $7.1 billion in total revenue for the quarter.Story continuesCompanies are seeking to upgrade a trillion dollars’ worth in data center infrastructure, CEO Jensen Huang said on a call with analysts Wednesday.A.I.-rally doubtsNot everyone is convinced. Economist David Rosenberg told CNBC on Thursday that the boom in A.I. stocks “looks very weird,” and is “way overextended.”“No question we have a price bubble,” he said on Thursday.A model from David Trainer, founder of investment research firm New Constructs, suggests that Nvidia would need to increase revenues by 20% annually for 20 years to reward its investors. “This is priced for fantasy,” Trainer told Fortune after Nvidia's jump in value.Nvidia continues to double down on A.I. The company announced a suite of new A.I.-powered services on Monday, at Taiwan’s Computex conference. The chipmaker announced a new supercomputer platform that would help tech companies like Microsoft and Meta create the next ChatGPT, as well as a new partnership with WPP to use generative A.I. to create new advertising.“I know it’s too much,” Huang said at the end of his keynote address.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang unveiled a new batch of products and services tied to artificial intelligence, looking to capitalize on a frenzy that has made his company the world’s most valuable chipmaker.Most Read from BloombergChina Is Drilling a 10,000-Meter-Deep Hole Into the EarthAmazon Is in Talks to Offer Free Mobile Service to US Prime MembersInside the Making of Redfall, Xbox’s Latest MisfireRich Latin Americans Transform Laid-Back Madrid Into a New MiamiHedge Funds at War for Top Traders Dangle $120 Million PayoutsThe wide-ranging lineup includes a new robotics design, gaming capabilities, advertising services and a networking technology. Perhaps most central to his ambitions, Huang took the wraps off an AI supercomputer platform called DGX GH200 that will help tech companies create successors to ChatGPT. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are expected to be among the first users.“It’s too much,” Huang, 60, said near the end of his keynote at the Computex show. “I know it’s too much.”The flurry of announcements underscores Nvidia’s shift from a maker of computer graphics chips to a company at the center of the AI boom. Last week, Huang gave a stunning sales forecast for the current quarter — almost $4 billion above analysts’ estimates — fueled by demand for data-center chips that handle AI tasks. That sent the stock to a record high and put Nvidia on the brink of a $1 trillion valuation — a first for the chip industry.In the presentation Monday, Huang argued the traditional architecture of the tech industry is no longer improving fast enough to keep up with complex computing tasks. To realize the full potential of AI, customers are increasingly turning to accelerated computing and graphics processing units, or GPUs, like those made by Nvidia.“We have reached the tipping point of a new computing era,” Huang said, as he paced the stage in a trademark leather jacket.Story continuesRead More: Nvidia Nailed Bet on AI Trend in Surge Toward $1 TrillionHuang also showed off the mind-bending capabilities of generative AI to take inputs in the form of words and then put out other media. In one case, he asked for music to match the mood of early morning. In another, he laid out a handful of lyrics and then used AI to transform the idea into a bouncy pop tune.“Everyone is a creator now,” he said.Huang showed how Nvidia is teaming up with WPP Plc to use AI and the metaverse to lower the cost of producing advertising. It’s releasing a networking offering that’s designed to turbocharge the speed of information within data centers. And the company is even looking to change how people interact with video games: A service called Nvidia ACE for Games will use AI to enliven background characters and give them more personality.Huang also unveiled a new robotics platform that he said is aimed at helping Nvidia expanding to industries beyond tech. It’s a reference design that will help other companies build their own robots for use in a range of activities. In heavy industry, for example, he sees opportunities in using robots in factories and warehouses.The DGX computer is another attempt to keep data center operators hooked on Nvidia’s products. Microsoft, Google and their peers are all racing to develop services similar to OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT chatbot — and that requires plenty of computing horsepower. To satisfy this appetite, Nvidia is both offering equipment for data centers and building its own supercomputers that customers can use. That includes two new supercomputers in Taiwan, the company said.One of the biggest AI bottlenecks is the speed at which data moves within data centers. Nvidia’s Spectrum X, a networking system that uses technology acquired in the 2020 purchase of Mellanox Technologies, will address that issue. And the company is building a data center in Israel to demonstrate how effective it is.The WPP partnership, meanwhile, will streamline the creation of advertising content. The UK advertising titan will use Nvidia’s Omniverse technology to create “virtual twins” of products that can be manipulated to customize ads and reduce the need for costly reshoots.Nvidia’s original business was selling graphics cards to gamers, and it’s returning to that world with the ACE offering. The service will address the problem of NPCs, or nonplayer characters, the background figures that populate video games. NPCs typically give repetitive responses with scripted dialogue, and that limited range has made them the subject of ridicule in memes and even the Ryan Reynolds movie “Free Guy.”Nvidia ACE will listen to what the gamer says to a character, convert into text and then dump that into a generative AI program to create a more natural, off-the-cuff response. The Santa Clara, California-based company is currently testing the service and will add guardrails to ensure that responses aren’t inappropriate or offensive.--With assistance from Mayumi Negishi and Peter Elstrom.(Updates with CEO comments from third paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Summer Camp Became Such a Hot Mess for ParentsHarvard MBA Grads Enter a Tepid Job Market Hoping for the BestCan Workplace Ketamine Retreats Improve Vibes in the Office?Goldman CEO Loves Summer Camp So Much He’s Expanded His PortfolioAssault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare Startup©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive How Much Debt Does Colgate-Palmolive Carry?As you can see below, at the end of March 2023, Colgate-Palmolive had US$8.91b of debt, up from US$7.61b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$1.14b in cash, and so its net debt is US$7.76b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Colgate-Palmolive's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.44b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$11.3b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.14b in cash and US$1.59b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$13.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Colgate-Palmolive has a very large market capitalization of US$63.2b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Colgate-Palmolive's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.0), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 18.5 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Unfortunately, Colgate-Palmolive's EBIT flopped 11% over the last four quarters. If earnings continue to decline at that rate then handling the debt will be more difficult than taking three children under 5 to a fancy pants restaurant. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Colgate-Palmolive produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 72% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewBoth Colgate-Palmolive's ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT and its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow gave us comfort that it can handle its debt. Having said that, its EBIT growth rate somewhat sensitizes us to potential future risks to the balance sheet. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Colgate-Palmolive is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

To see more such companies, go directly to ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.If there’s one thing that can be learned from literally hundreds of ChatGPT-related posts out there claiming that the AI chatbot has successfully beaten the market, it’s that ChatGPT’s responses show huge variance based on the input it receives and one should learn to enjoy and benefit from the diversity of possibilities offered by AI. In January this year, people at Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to make an ETF to beat the US stock market. ChatGPT gave nothing in return but the age-old cliché statement to the effect of “past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns” and that it’s not possible to beat the market for it due to massive volatility.But many experts were able to force ChatGPT to blurt out a list of stocks by asking it to act as an expert stock adviser. To check out some stocks recommended by ChatGPT, see our article published back in March where we asked ChatGPT to pick stocks that have the potential to make investors rich.Investors have been toying with the idea of using AI to beat the market for quite some time now. Back in 2021, when Sam Altman’s OpenAI was perhaps getting ready to unleash the market-moving, earth-shattering thing that is ChatGPT, Bloomberg had reported that researchers at the University of Oxford claimed they have come up with a machine learning model with a capability to predict stock price movements. They claimed that the model posted a whopping 80% success rate for the equivalent of about 30 seconds of live trading.The Bloomberg report at the time said that the researchers, who were backed by the UK-based Man Group, used natural-language processing algorithms to process trading data. The report said that the algorithm managed to predict the future trajectory of a price over a period of 100 ticks.The Buzzword GameWe’ll take a detailed look at whether or not AI is good at stock picking but one thing is for sure: AI has a huge impact on the stock markets, so much so that many investors are comparing the AI-driven stock market gains to the ones seen in the crypto markets and during the dot-com era. Just look at what’s happening at companies’ earnings calls. Companies are repeatedly using buzzwords like “generative AI”, “large language models”, “artificial intelligence”, etc. during their earnings call and shareholder meetings. Bloomberg in a report quoted interesting data points which show that the use of the word “artificial intelligence” jumped a whopping 85% during earnings calls. There’s a reason why everyone is talking about AI. Whenever a company announces plans to somehow deploy AI in its operations, its stock price jumps. Even non-tech companies like Wendy’s enjoyed stock price gains when they announced plans to cut costs using AI.Story continuesWhat's Happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?But what’s happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strange and highly unprecedented. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares skyrocketed by 25% on May 25 after the company posted solid quarterly results and gave a revenue guidance of $11 billion for the second quarter, shocking Wall Street analysts who have a $7.2 billion estimate for the metric. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s guided revenue is up 64% from the year-ago period, and comes on the huge demand fueled by the widespread use of applications like ChatGPT.Dan Ives of Wedbus commented on this development:""In 22 years of covering tech stocks and large cap we have never seen a guidance range of this magnitude on a large cap tech name…And thus speaks to our thesis that the monetization of AI for stalwarts like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is well underway.""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s management during the company’s Q4 earnings call was already pointing to the huge potential coming from the generative AI space. Here’s what the company’s CEO Jensen Huang had said:""The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point.

Start a 7-day free trial now.Nvidia nears $1T market cap after bolstered outlookNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared 27% Thursday, taking its market cap within spitting distance of $1 trillion, after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and guidance that markedly topped Wall Street estimates.The company said it expected second-quarter revenue of about $11B, well above analyst expectations of $7B, as the growing need for artificial intelligence has bolstered the outlook for chip demand in its data center business.The numbers prompted three Wall Street firms to upgrade the stock and raise its price target by hundreds of dollars per share: Nvidia now has buy ratings at Craig-Hallum, Wedbush, and Baird - up from prior neutral ratings - with price targets ranging between $475 and $500.The action in Nvidia triggered a surge across the tech space and ultimately led a broad-market rally.Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR), which provides power management solutions for some of Nvidia’s chips, was up sharply, as were Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).Over in Europe, ASM International NV (AS:ASMI), ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML), and Siltronic AG (F:WAFGn), also saw big gains.Nvidia ended the week at $389.46.Micron chips get banned in ChinaA day earlier, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) said its revenue growth would come in the low-single-digit percentage, down from the high single digits, after China banned the sale of its memory chips to a wide swath of key industries in the country, saying they had failed a national security review.Story continuesMicron said last week it would start making next-gen memory chips in Japan. Bloomberg News reported the chipmaker will receive about $1.5 billion in financial incentives from Japan's government.Bernstein estimates that the impact will be measured in “low-single digits only in the near term,"" noting that the ban is only on ""domestic critical information infrastructure operators"" and that ""other customers, especially those selling civilian products to other countries, are not legally required to do so.""Citi says the decision was expected and “will temporarily hurt Micron but won’t interfere with the DRAM recovery.”Micron shares lost ground initially but more than recovered, ending the week up about 12% to $73.93.Apple strikes a 'multi-billion-dollar' deal with BroadcomOn Tuesday Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced a “multi-billion-dollar” deal that will see the tech behemoth purchase 5G radio frequency components from Broadcom, including its FBAR filters.“We’re thrilled to make commitments that harness the ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit of American manufacturing,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.Wall Street weighed in positively.CFRA boosted the AVGO price target to $750 per share after hiking price-to-earnings estimates to reflect the Apple deal. It noted opportunity arising from the company's AI initiatives and said it thinks shares have upside ""whether a deal is done or not.”Similarly, BofA raised its price target on Buy-rated AVGO shares to $800 per share. The analyst argues that the Apple contract removes “key overhang re trends at largest customer"" and said the stock has a ""highly underappreciated/overlooked position as a leading provider of custom AI computing and switching silicon.”BofA added that Broadcom is the “most underappreciated AI beneficiary.”Marvell surges on robust AI-driven guidanceMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares rocketed more than 30% Friday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and offered encouraging revenue guidance for the current quarter as AI emerges as a key growth driver.The chipmaker reported Q1 adjusted EPS of 31 cents on revenue of $1.32 billion, compared with estimates for 29 cents on revenue of $1.30B.Looking ahead, the company forecast fiscal second-quarter adjusted EPS to be 32 cents per share, plus or minus 5 cents, while net revenue is expected to be $1.33B, plus or minus 5%. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of $1.31 and revenue of $1.31B.The company sees annual revenue related to artificial intelligence to at least double in fiscal 2024.Stifel raised its price target by $9 to $65, saying the company's big data infrastructure bet is paying off: ""Given the increased visibility into healthier q/q growth rates and material operating leverage, we reiterate Buy on MRVL (top large-cap pick).""Rosenblatt still sees Marvell and Nvidia as top secular ideas, and has a $100 price target on MRVL stock: ""Now that the overhead of inventory concerns has been lifted and AI momentum is emerging the story is cleaner from here on out.""Senad Karaahmetovic, Yasin Ebrahim, Scott Kanowsky, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.In fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.

(NYSE:FIS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.52 on the 23rd of June, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.8%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Fidelity National Information Services' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Fidelity National Information Services is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 116.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 47%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendFidelity National Information Services Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.80 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.08. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 10% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Earnings per share has been sinking by 85% over the last five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Fidelity National Information Services' DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best June Dividend Stocks To Buy. Apart from their significant contribution to the market’s overall returns, dividend stocks can also potentially be beneficial in an inflationary environment. In 2022, consistent interest rates hike jolted the market, which made investors seek solace in the dividend stocks with growth potential. The S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, compared with a 6.21% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, an index that tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth.The popularity of dividend stocks has varied over time based on market conditions and investor preferences. Investments in growth stocks surged in the early 2000s because investors were drawn to companies with high growth potential, even if they didn’t offer any dividends. However, with the onset of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, dividend stocks witnessed a renewed interest. CNBC reported that the S&amp;P 500 companies paid $207 billion to investors in dividends in 2010, showing a 5.6% growth from 2009. The amount has grown tremendously over the years, reaching its record high of $561 billion in 2022, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.The continuous growth in dividend payments throughout these years shows that investments in dividend-growth stocks can be a reliable option during different market conditions. These stocks can be a hedge against inflation and can also offer long-term capital appreciation potential. Various studies have highlighted that dividend growth has outpaced inflation historically. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited BlackRock’s data, which revealed that dividends paid by US companies from 1971 to 2021 grew by 3.7% per year on average, compared with a 2% growth in inflation per year.Story continuesAnalysts also advise investing in companies with strong dividend growth track records. Kristen Bitterly, head of North America for Citi Global Wealth, spoke with Bloomberg about the importance of dividend growers. She said that her firm prefers well-established companies that are less sensitive to changes in economic conditions. She further mentioned that dividend aristocrats have outperformed the market in 25 of the last 32 years. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the best dividend stocks that have consistently rewarded shareholders with growing dividends.Also read: 15 Best Large-Cap Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy NowThe Dividend Capture StrategyIn addition to investing in dividend growers to generate regular income, investors also follow a dividend capture strategy.

In fact, Allstate is a new position that we added to the portfolio in Q1. It is one of the largest providers of auto and homeowners’ insurance in the United States. Allstate has a strong brand and significant scale advantages over smaller peers.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, McDonald's investors that purchase the stock on or after the 2nd of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.52 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.08 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, McDonald's stock has a trailing yield of around 2.1% on the current share price of $286.04. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether McDonald's has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for McDonald's Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. McDonald's paid out more than half (62%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 75% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that McDonald's's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see McDonald's earnings per share are up 7.9% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests McDonald's has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, McDonald's has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.1% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid McDonald's? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and McDonald's paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.If you want to look further into McDonald's, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for McDonald's you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. Having said that, after a brief look, Seagate Technology Holdings (NASDAQ:STX) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Seagate Technology Holdings:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.024 = US$103m ÷ (US$8.0b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Seagate Technology Holdings has an ROCE of 2.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Tech industry average of 7.1%. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings roceIn the above chart we have measured Seagate Technology Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Seagate Technology Holdings' ROCE Trend?In terms of Seagate Technology Holdings' historical ROCE trend, it isn't fantastic. The company used to generate 25% on its capital five years ago but it has since fallen noticeably. In addition to that, Seagate Technology Holdings is now employing 27% less capital than it was five years ago. The fact that both are shrinking is an indication that the business is going through some tough times. Typically businesses that exhibit these characteristics aren't the ones that tend to multiply over the long term, because statistically speaking, they've already gone through the growth phase of their life cycle.Story continuesWhile on the subject, we noticed that the ratio of current liabilities to total assets has risen to 46%, which has impacted the ROCE. Without this increase, it's likely that ROCE would be even lower than 2.4%. What this means is that in reality, a rather large portion of the business is being funded by the likes of the company's suppliers or short-term creditors, which can bring some risks of its own.The Key TakeawayTo see Seagate Technology Holdings reducing the capital employed in the business in tandem with diminishing returns, is concerning. Despite the concerning underlying trends, the stock has actually gained 35% over the last five years, so it might be that the investors are expecting the trends to reverse. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere.One more thing to note, we've identified   3 warning signs  with Seagate Technology Holdings and understanding them should be part of your investment process.While Seagate Technology Holdings isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price is up 63% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 33% (not including dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for American Express There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).American Express was able to grow its EPS at 13% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 18% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of American Express, it has a TSR of 69% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 1.0% in the last year, American Express shareholders lost 5.9% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 11% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for American Express that you should be aware of before investing here.American Express is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.57bUS$6.61bUS$5.13bUS$5.37bUS$5.33bUS$5.33bUS$5.37bUS$5.43bUS$5.51bUS$5.60bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 0.13%Est @ 0.72%Est @ 1.14%Est @ 1.43%Est @ 1.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$6.0kUS$5.4kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.3kUS$3.0kUS$2.7kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$70bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$70b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$61b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$58.9, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.371. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Occidental Petroleum, we've put together three relevant aspects you should explore:Risks: Be aware that  Occidental Petroleum is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...Future Earnings: How does OXY's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Today, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, is trading at $74 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, currently trades for $78 per barrel. The decline in crude oil has led to a pullback in the share prices of major oil companies in recent months following a stampeding bull run throughout much of 2022. On the backs of record profits, dividend increases and share buybacks, oil stocks were the best stocks to buy in 2022. Many leading energy companies saw their share price more than double. Now, the stocks of oil and natural gas companies are again in retreat as prices for crude normalize.So, should investors buy the dip or wait to see where oil prices settle before starting a new position? The consensus view of analysts seems to be for investors to take advantage of the current retreat and buy shares in energy companies. Here are the three best oil stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comU.S. energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is increasing its oil footprint by acquiring shale producer PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PDCE). The takeover of PDC will enable Chevron to increase its U.S. production, capital expenditures and cash flow. Simultaneously, Chevron will start to scale back in other parts of the world over geopolitical issues such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and civil war in Africa.Many analysts praise the PDC Energy acquisition and say it should help elevate CVX stock. HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) raised its price target on Chevron’s stock to $198 and maintained a “hold” rating on the shares. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) kept its $198 price target, but lifted its recommendation to a “buy” rating. After a big run up in the first half of last year, CVX stock has pulled back 15% in the past six months, presenting a decent entry point for investors. A dividend that yields 3.84% is attractive too.Story continuesOccidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comFamed investor Warren Buffett keeps on buying shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). The latest regulatory disclosure shows that Buffett bought more OXY stock this year as the price has slumped. The Oracle of Omaha purchased 3.46 million Occidental shares in May, paying just over $200 million for them. Buffett now owns 24.4% of the U.S. oil company worth a total of $12.7 billion. He seems to start buying the stock each time its price dips below $60 per share.At this year’s annual meeting of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), Buffett threw cold water on the rumors that he is planning to take majority control of Occidental Petroleum. He told the assembled crowd that “We’re not going to buy control… We wouldn’t know what to do with it.” As with Chevron, OXY stock has retreated over the past six months. It declined 15% after the share price more than doubled in 2022, with its dividend currently yielding 1.20%.British Petroleum (BP)While BP Stock Looks too Cheap to Pass On, There Could be Lower Lows AheadSource: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.comEuropean energy giant British Petroleum (NYSE:BP), commonly known as “BP,” saw its share price dip recently after it announced plans to slow its pace of stock buybacks. The news arrived as BP reported a $5 billion profit in this year’s first quarter due largely to successful oil and gas trading by the company. However, BP stock dipped more than 8% on the news that the company plans to repurchase $1.75 billion worth of shares in this year’s second quarter, down from $2.75 billion in the previous quarter.Despite the post-earnings dip, BP stock has increased 4% in the last six months as most of its peers have seen their share prices decline. The company has avoided a slump in its stock, thanks to its ability to continue generating strong profits even as the price of oil retreats. Plus, many investors are attracted to BP’s hefty quarterly dividend payment, which currently yields 4.36%. In 2022, BP posted record annual profits of $27.7 billion — more than double its profits in 2021. The company’s previous record profit was $26.3 billion back in 2008.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MS.

90,fcf932d3-c4ba-3cbb-b8f9-77296276b0a5,BSX,2023-05-29,Can Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) Performance Keep Up Given Its Mixed Bag Of Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-corporation-nyse-bsx-130054919.html,1685278854,STORY,['BSX'],"[Boston Scientific's (NYSE:BSX) stock is up by 9.1% over the past three months. However, the company's financials look a bit inconsistent and market outcomes are ultimately driven by long-term fundamentals, meaning that the stock could head in either direction. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Boston Scientific's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boston Scientific is:5.0% = US$902m ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Boston Scientific's Earnings Growth And 5.0% ROEOn the face of it, Boston Scientific's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 9.4%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 11% seen by Boston Scientific was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Boston Scientific's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 9.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Boston Scientific is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Boston Scientific Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Boston Scientific doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Boston Scientific's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

To see more such companies, go directly to ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.If there’s one thing that can be learned from literally hundreds of ChatGPT-related posts out there claiming that the AI chatbot has successfully beaten the market, it’s that ChatGPT’s responses show huge variance based on the input it receives and one should learn to enjoy and benefit from the diversity of possibilities offered by AI. In January this year, people at Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to make an ETF to beat the US stock market. ChatGPT gave nothing in return but the age-old cliché statement to the effect of “past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns” and that it’s not possible to beat the market for it due to massive volatility.But many experts were able to force ChatGPT to blurt out a list of stocks by asking it to act as an expert stock adviser. To check out some stocks recommended by ChatGPT, see our article published back in March where we asked ChatGPT to pick stocks that have the potential to make investors rich.Investors have been toying with the idea of using AI to beat the market for quite some time now. Back in 2021, when Sam Altman’s OpenAI was perhaps getting ready to unleash the market-moving, earth-shattering thing that is ChatGPT, Bloomberg had reported that researchers at the University of Oxford claimed they have come up with a machine learning model with a capability to predict stock price movements. They claimed that the model posted a whopping 80% success rate for the equivalent of about 30 seconds of live trading.The Bloomberg report at the time said that the researchers, who were backed by the UK-based Man Group, used natural-language processing algorithms to process trading data. The report said that the algorithm managed to predict the future trajectory of a price over a period of 100 ticks.The Buzzword GameWe’ll take a detailed look at whether or not AI is good at stock picking but one thing is for sure: AI has a huge impact on the stock markets, so much so that many investors are comparing the AI-driven stock market gains to the ones seen in the crypto markets and during the dot-com era. Just look at what’s happening at companies’ earnings calls. Companies are repeatedly using buzzwords like “generative AI”, “large language models”, “artificial intelligence”, etc. during their earnings call and shareholder meetings. Bloomberg in a report quoted interesting data points which show that the use of the word “artificial intelligence” jumped a whopping 85% during earnings calls. There’s a reason why everyone is talking about AI. Whenever a company announces plans to somehow deploy AI in its operations, its stock price jumps. Even non-tech companies like Wendy’s enjoyed stock price gains when they announced plans to cut costs using AI.Story continuesWhat's Happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?But what’s happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strange and highly unprecedented. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares skyrocketed by 25% on May 25 after the company posted solid quarterly results and gave a revenue guidance of $11 billion for the second quarter, shocking Wall Street analysts who have a $7.2 billion estimate for the metric. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s guided revenue is up 64% from the year-ago period, and comes on the huge demand fueled by the widespread use of applications like ChatGPT.Dan Ives of Wedbus commented on this development:""In 22 years of covering tech stocks and large cap we have never seen a guidance range of this magnitude on a large cap tech name…And thus speaks to our thesis that the monetization of AI for stalwarts like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is well underway.""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s management during the company’s Q4 earnings call was already pointing to the huge potential coming from the generative AI space. Here’s what the company’s CEO Jensen Huang had said:""The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 38% in three years, versus a market return of about 40%. Furthermore, it's down 19% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Incyte To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Incyte became profitable within the last five years. We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too.Revenue is actually up 14% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. It's probably worth investigating Incyte further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthIncyte is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Incyte will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Incyte had a tough year, with a total loss of 19%, against a market gain of about 1.0%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.The stock market turmoil caused by rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies didn’t see an end in 2023. Amid uncertainty, the demand for stable, mature and reliable stocks increased. That’s why major, large-cap companies are clearly beating small-cap stocks this year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 7.3% year to date, while The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 was down 3.3%, as of May 16. A recent WSJ report quoted data from Dow Jones Market Data which showed that this spread of 10.6% percentage points shows the S&amp;P 500's biggest outperformance through May 16 since 2020.Hedge funds are also upping their bets on blue chip stocks. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds updated to reflect the Q1 portfolios shows that major blue chip companies remain popular among the elite hedge funds in the US. Technology sector remains the most favorite area to invest in for smart money investors.Why Invest in Blue Chip Stocks?However Raymond James said in its primer on blue chip stocks that these equities are not the go-to options for growth investors. However, the reliability and dividend income that is promised by several major blue chip stocks make these stocks attractive for investors. Here's how Raymond James explains the lure of blue chip stocks:Clearly, blue chips are unlikely candidates for growth investors seeking above average returns in a short period of time. But blue often possess understated value that could make them a superior investment over time. One of the chief advantages of blue chips is their dual investment value. As equities, their share price appreciates with earnings growth, albeit at a lower rate than a growth stock. Then there’s the dividend income which most blue chips are likely to payout to investors. Over the long term, the combination of gradual stock price appreciation and regular dividend income (made all the more attractive if there is a dividend re-investment program), can give blue chip investments a very reasonable long-term rate of return.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 15 blue chip stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds15.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) had been under pressure amid rising competition and subscription growth challenges. But Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is taking strong steps to spur growth. That has caused a 21% growth in its stock price in 2023 through May 26. Reports suggest that Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:JPM) was perhaps one of the biggest beneficiaries of the regional banking collapse seen earlier this year as people withdrew their funds from smaller banks and flocked to large banks like JPMorgan. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up about 4% over the past one year. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is also a dividend payer.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”11. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Hedge funds are initiating stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) amid signs that the Chinese ecommerce retailer could rebound in the near future. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) recently denied rumors circulating in the media that it was planning to cut 20% of its workforce.

The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organisational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.”10. Apple Inc.

While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives. Aside from production disruptions, negative sentiment had also weighed on shares as investors questioned how an economic slowdown would affect consumer demand for Apple products in 2023. However, management projected an acceleration in earnings for the fiscal first quarter, where they noted that iPhone and services growth should remain strong, along with encouraging impacts around product mix, lower input costs, and continued cost controls.”9.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put. Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. As such, we believe Nvidia is a long-term high unit volume growth opportunity. During the period, NVIDIA reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that met expectations, as the company navigated. through an inventory correction associated with the broad macroeconomic slowdown. Moreover, management gave fiscal year earnings guidance that was better than analyst estimates. noting strong year-over-year growth in gaming and data centers.

Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.80, beating estimates by $0.09.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”6. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) recently posted strong earnings for the most recent quarter, beating estimates for both earnings and revenue. After the earnings report Susquehanna's Syam Patil gave bullish comments for the stock, impressed by its quarterly results and guidance. The analyst said Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is seeing “continued solid top-line traction while demonstrating discipline on the cost side.”BTIG also reiterated its Buy rating on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) after the quarterly results.Hedge fund sentiment around Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) jumped in the first quarter. Insider Monkey’s database shows that 144 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of March, up from 135 funds in the previous quarter.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 15 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
98,db89aaf3-b73a-36ad-a1e5-8f6b0848b7b0,LKQ,2023-05-29,The total return for LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-lkq-nasdaq-lkq-140913083.html,1685282953,STORY,['LKQ'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) shareholders have seen the share price rise 95% over three years, well in excess of the market return (33%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 4.4% in the last year , including dividends .In light of the stock dropping 3.9% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. Check out our latest analysis for LKQ While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, LKQ achieved compound earnings per share growth of 31% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how LKQ has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for LKQ the TSR over the last 3 years was 102%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that LKQ shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.4% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 12% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand LKQ better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - LKQ has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

99,e8ff234f-760c-33a3-80ef-5362685f0e8a,EL,2023-05-29,Can The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-110109190.html,1685358069,STORY,['EL'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:16% = US$1.1b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit.Does Estée Lauder Companies Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Estée Lauder Companies has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Personal Products industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Estée Lauder Companies' Debt And Its 16% Return On EquityEstée Lauder Companies clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.12. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Estée Lauder Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

100,dc0b5a36-3c9c-3787-8cf1-e55c33128bfe,EL,2023-05-29,What Does George Soros Know That You Don’t? 3 Stocks The Billionaire Loves.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-george-soros-know-don-144315440.html,1684939395,STORY,"['EL', 'NFLX', 'NKE']","[The latest 13F regulatory disclosure of hedge fund managers recently came out for this year’s first quarter, and, as usual, the buying and selling of the world’s leading investors has generated a lot of media attention and online commentary. Chief among them is George Soros, the billionaire investing legend who famously made $1 billion shorting the British pound currency in the early 1990s. Although he is now age 92, it is reported that Soros continues to be an active investor through Soros Fund Management, a former hedge fund that is today structured as a family office. Founded in 1970,  Soros Fund Management continues to be one of the most successful investment firms in the world, averaging a 20% annual return over more than 50 years. So what does George Soros know that you don’t? Here are three stocks the billionaire loves.George Soros Stock Picks: Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comOne of the positions that Soros Fund Management increased the most during Q1 of this year was in the cosmetics company Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL). Soros raised his stake in EL stock by more than 40%, bringing his current position to 159,100 shares worth a total of $39.2 million. Soros Fund bought Estee Lauder shares as they have fallen throughout this year. So far in 2023, the company’s share price has sunk 21%. Clearly, Soros and his firm have seen the decline in Estee Lauder stock as a buying opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEstee Lauder has struggled with Covid-19 lockdowns in China and has seen its global sales slump throughout Asia. Consequently, the company recently lowered its 2023 sales guidance, saying it now expects its fiscal 2023 sales to decline in a range of 10% to 12%, which is much worse than previous guidance for sales to drop 5% to 7% this year. The lowered guidance came as Estee Lauder reported an earnings per share decline of 75% in its most recent quarter. Soros though seems to be betting that the decline in EL stock won’t last long. Thus, it is among the top George Soros stock picks.Story continuesNike (NKE)A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.comAnother stock that Soros Fund seems to have liked as its share price has slumped is the sneaker and athletic apparel maker Nike (NYSE:NKE). The fund nearly tripled its position in NKE stock to 166,720 shares in Q1. The fund’s stake in Nike is currently worth $19.1 million. Year to date, Nike’s share price is down 3%. The stock is now 35% below the peak it reached in November 2021. Soros seems to be betting that a turnaround in NKE stock is coming.Over the past 18 months, Nike’s stock has been hurt by excessive inventory levels and slumping sales in Asia, notably China. However, despite those issues, the company has managed to continue to report better-than-expected earnings, boosted by strong sales in North America. Nike has telegraphed that its inventory levels have been coming down substantially and there is an expectation of a turnaround in Asia now that China has ended its Covid-19 policies. NKE stock could pop when the company next reports earnings on June 26. That’s a great reason why I regard NKE as one of the best George Soros stock picks.Netflix (NFLX)the netflix logo displayed on a tablet that a person is holding while laying downSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.comTalking of George Soros stock picks, he opened a new position in streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) during Q1. The fund invested $12 million to buy 35,000 shares of NFLX stock. This was one of only a handful of new positions Soros Fund opened during the quarter, including new stakes in discount retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). The new position in NFLX stock is interesting in that Soros bought it as the share price rose. So far this year, Netflix’s share price has gained 25% and has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.Like many investors, Soros may be convinced that Netflix is again on a path to growth and higher profits after cutting back its production budget on new movies and TV shows last year, cracking down on password sharing worldwide, and introducing advertising to the streaming platform. Those changes seem to have had a positive impact on Netflix’s earnings and led to a turnaround in NFLX stock since last spring when it looked, briefly, like the company’s best days were behind it.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

101,9a921f30-4609-328e-a130-d22c6ba14e81,PG,2023-05-29,ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-stock-portfolio-top-10-150929797.html,1685286569,STORY,"['NVDA', 'JNJ', 'BRK-B', 'KO', 'HD', 'MMM', 'PG', 'ORCL']","[In this article, we will take a look at ChatGPT stock portfolio. To see more such companies, go directly to ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.If there’s one thing that can be learned from literally hundreds of ChatGPT-related posts out there claiming that the AI chatbot has successfully beaten the market, it’s that ChatGPT’s responses show huge variance based on the input it receives and one should learn to enjoy and benefit from the diversity of possibilities offered by AI. In January this year, people at Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to make an ETF to beat the US stock market. ChatGPT gave nothing in return but the age-old cliché statement to the effect of “past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns” and that it’s not possible to beat the market for it due to massive volatility.But many experts were able to force ChatGPT to blurt out a list of stocks by asking it to act as an expert stock adviser. To check out some stocks recommended by ChatGPT, see our article published back in March where we asked ChatGPT to pick stocks that have the potential to make investors rich.Investors have been toying with the idea of using AI to beat the market for quite some time now. Back in 2021, when Sam Altman’s OpenAI was perhaps getting ready to unleash the market-moving, earth-shattering thing that is ChatGPT, Bloomberg had reported that researchers at the University of Oxford claimed they have come up with a machine learning model with a capability to predict stock price movements. They claimed that the model posted a whopping 80% success rate for the equivalent of about 30 seconds of live trading.The Bloomberg report at the time said that the researchers, who were backed by the UK-based Man Group, used natural-language processing algorithms to process trading data. The report said that the algorithm managed to predict the future trajectory of a price over a period of 100 ticks.The Buzzword GameWe’ll take a detailed look at whether or not AI is good at stock picking but one thing is for sure: AI has a huge impact on the stock markets, so much so that many investors are comparing the AI-driven stock market gains to the ones seen in the crypto markets and during the dot-com era. Just look at what’s happening at companies’ earnings calls. Companies are repeatedly using buzzwords like “generative AI”, “large language models”, “artificial intelligence”, etc. during their earnings call and shareholder meetings. Bloomberg in a report quoted interesting data points which show that the use of the word “artificial intelligence” jumped a whopping 85% during earnings calls. There’s a reason why everyone is talking about AI. Whenever a company announces plans to somehow deploy AI in its operations, its stock price jumps. Even non-tech companies like Wendy’s enjoyed stock price gains when they announced plans to cut costs using AI.Story continuesWhat's Happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?But what’s happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strange and highly unprecedented. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares skyrocketed by 25% on May 25 after the company posted solid quarterly results and gave a revenue guidance of $11 billion for the second quarter, shocking Wall Street analysts who have a $7.2 billion estimate for the metric. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s guided revenue is up 64% from the year-ago period, and comes on the huge demand fueled by the widespread use of applications like ChatGPT.Dan Ives of Wedbus commented on this development:""In 22 years of covering tech stocks and large cap we have never seen a guidance range of this magnitude on a large cap tech name…And thus speaks to our thesis that the monetization of AI for stalwarts like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is well underway.""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s management during the company’s Q4 earnings call was already pointing to the huge potential coming from the generative AI space. Here’s what the company’s CEO Jensen Huang had said:""The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.

ChatGPT came up with a comprehensive portfolio. This portfolio contains 38 stocks.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. Just take a look at Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL), which is up 77%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 33% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 9.4% in the last year , including dividends .Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.6%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. See our latest analysis for Aflac In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Aflac was able to grow its EPS at 22% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. Notably, the 21% average annual share price gain matches up nicely with the EPS growth rate. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Aflac has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Aflac the TSR over the last 3 years was 91%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Aflac has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 9.4% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 10% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

106,8f8502a8-2eb9-3580-a241-684c35579fbf,GPS,2023-05-29,Gap (NYSE:GPS) Will Pay A Dividend Of $0.15,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-nyse-gps-pay-dividend-121620168.html,1685276180,STORY,['GPS'],"[The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.15 per share on the 26th of July. This makes the dividend yield 7.2%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Gap's stock price has reduced by 36% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Gap Gap Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Gap is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 163.7%. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the company could be paying out several times what it earns in the next 12 months, which could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.50 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.8% over that duration. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Gap's EPS has fallen by approximately 35% per year during the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We don't think Gap is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Cisco Systems, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$15b ÷ (US$98b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 9.9%. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cisco Systems compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cisco Systems.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCisco Systems is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 44% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To sum it up, Cisco Systems is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Considering the stock has delivered 33% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Cisco Systems that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?
