When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabThe Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$25m worth of shares at a price of US$80.10 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$47.73. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$7.9m for 135.84k shares. On the other hand they divested 1.87m shares, for US$140m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Charles Schwab recently. In total, insiders sold US$12m worth of shares in that time. On the other hand we note insiders bought US$7.9m worth of shares , as previously mentioned . Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the company has been fully valued in recent months.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Charles SchwabLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Charles Schwab insiders own 1.4% of the company, currently worth about US$1.2b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Charles Schwab Tell Us?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Charles Schwab stock, than buying, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that Charles Schwab is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Charles Schwab you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Sequentially, an increase in capacity enterprise drive shipments was offset by a decrease in flash shipments. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a decline in shipments of both hard drive and flash products, as well as price decreases in Flash.Client represented 35% of total revenue. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decrease was driven by price declines across our flash products and a lower client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC applications.Consumer represented 22% of total revenue. Sequentially, the decrease was due to a seasonal decline in shipments of both retail hard drive and flash products, as well as price declines in retail Flash.

The company’s Non-GAAP operating expenses guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, and expenses related to strategic review, totaling approximately $140 million to $160 million. In the aggregate, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes these items totaling $150 million to $175 million. The timing and amount of these charges excluded from Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share cannot be further allocated or quantified with certainty. Additionally, the timing and amount of additional charges the company excludes from its Non-GAAP income tax expense and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are dependent on the timing and determination of certain actions and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, full reconciliations of Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP income tax expense and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (GAAP gross profit, GAAP operating expenses, income tax expense and diluted earnings per share, respectively) are not available without unreasonable effort.(2) The Non-GAAP income tax expense is determined based on a percentage of Non-GAAP pre-tax income or loss. Our estimated Non-GAAP tax dollars may differ from our GAAP tax dollars (i) due to differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from our Non-GAAP net income; (ii) the fact that our GAAP income tax expense or benefit recorded in any interim period is based on an estimated forecasted GAAP tax rate for the full year, excluding loss jurisdictions; and (iii) because our GAAP taxes recorded in any interim period are dependent on the timing and determination of certain GAAP operating expenses.Investor CommunicationsThe investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company’s business outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 will be broadcast live online today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific/4:30 p.m. Eastern.

These Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The company believes the presentation of these Non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors for measuring the company’s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods. Specifically, the company believes these Non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors as they exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results or because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the company and its peers. As discussed further below, these Non-GAAP measures exclude, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, contamination related charges, recoveries from a power outage incident, employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, expenses related to our strategic review, non-cash economic interest, other adjustments, and income tax adjustments, and the company believes these measures along with the related reconciliations to the GAAP measures provide additional detail and comparability for assessing the company’s results. These Non-GAAP measures are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the company’s performance and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.As described above, the company excludes the following items from its Non-GAAP measures:Stock-based compensation expense. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the company’s control, the company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the company’s peers, a majority of whom also exclude stock-based compensation expense from their Non-GAAP results.Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company incurs expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets over their economic lives. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the company’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges.Contamination related charges. In February 2022, a contamination of certain materials used in the company’s manufacturing process occurred and affected production operation at the flash-based memory manufacturing facilities in Yokkaichi and Kitakami, Japan, which are operated through the company’s joint business ventures with Kioxia Corporation (collectively, ""Flash Ventures""). The contamination resulted in scrapped inventory and rework costs, decontamination and other costs needed to restore the facilities to normal capacity, and under absorption of overhead costs, which are expensed as incurred. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes these charges are not part of the ongoing production operation of its business.Recoveries from a power outage incident. In June 2019, an unexpected power outage incident occurred at the flash-based memory manufacturing facilities operated through the company’s joint venture with Kioxia Corporation in Yokkaichi, Japan. The power outage incident resulted in costs associated with the repair of damaged tools and the write-off of damaged inventory and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs which are expensed as incurred. During fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the company received recoveries for these losses from other parties. The recoveries are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes they are not part of the ongoing production operation of its business.Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges. From time-to-time, in order to realign the company’s operations with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the integration of acquisitions, the company may terminate employees and/or restructure its operations. From time-to-time, the company may also incur charges from the impairment of intangible assets and other long-lived assets. In addition, the company may record credits related to gains upon sale of property due to restructuring or reversals of charges recorded in prior periods. These charges or credits are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.Strategic review. The company incurred expenses associated with its ongoing review of potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing the long-term value for stockholders. The company believes these charges do not reflect the company’s operating results and that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.Non-cash economic interest. The company has excluded non-cash economic interest expense associated with its convertible notes recognized in periods prior to the company’s adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, ""Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity"", which the company adopted at the beginning of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The exclusion of such amounts from prior periods facilitates a comparison of the company's prior period results to the current period presentation.Other adjustments. From time-to-time, the company incurs charges or gains that the company believes are not a part of the ongoing operation of its business. The resulting expense or benefit is inconsistent in amount and frequency.Income tax adjustments. Income tax adjustments include the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual Non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate as a result of the timing of certain Non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments. The income tax adjustments also include adjustments to estimates related to the current status of the rules and regulations governing the transition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to tax positions taken in prior quarters, including interest. These adjustments are excluded because the company believes that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its ongoing business.Additionally, free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net, and the activity related to Flash Ventures, net. The company considers free cash flow generated in any period to be a useful indicator of cash that is available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the company’s business, making strategic acquisitions, repaying debt and strengthening the balance sheet.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230508005539/en/ContactsWestern Digital Corp.Investor Contact: T.

9,86d87045-37d3-3fce-abf5-1357221f530a,AYI,2023-05-12,"Are Acuity Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:AYI) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acuity-brands-inc-nyse-ayi-181904802.html,1683829144,STORY,['AYI'],"[Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) has had a rough three months with its share price down 16%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Acuity Brands'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Acuity Brands How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Acuity Brands is:19% = US$379m ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Acuity Brands' Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo start with, Acuity Brands' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 15% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Acuity Brands saw little to no growth in the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesWe then compared Acuity Brands' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 10% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AYI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Acuity Brands Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Acuity Brands' low three-year median payout ratio of 6.2% (implying that the company keeps94% of its income) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth and this should be reflected in its growth number, but that's not the case.In addition, Acuity Brands has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.8% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Acuity Brands has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

12,476b362d-3ea3-3f4e-ac79-a54f3a8a04ff,PVH,2023-05-12,Add These 5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Your Portfolio in May,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-5-low-price-book-111411179.html,1683803651,STORY,"['GM', 'DBK.DE', 'UNM', 'PVH']","[In value analysis, though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are most preferred by investors, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank DB, General Motors GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH and Varex Imaging Corporation VREX are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.Billionaire Warren Buffett has time and again proved that he is truly peerless when it comes to investing. His simple style and relentless repetition of age-old, tried and tested and sometimes cliché investing principles make it all look easy. And it seems Buffett’s true genius shines when things are going south for the broader markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that Berkshire also outperforms during recessions and bears markets. The firm says that Berkshire shares have beaten the market for no less than six recessions since 1980 by a median of 4.41 percentage points.During the same time period, Berkshire Hathaway, which is up about 4.5% year to date through May 10, surpassed S&amp;P 500 each time it dropped 20%, beating the broader index by a median of 14.89 percentage points.There are many lessons that could be drawn from decades of jaw-dropping outperformance of the Oracle of Omaha. But the most important and relevant of these is Buffett’s focus on dividends.$5.7 Billion in Cash in a Single YearAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, which cites an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is expected to generate $5.7 billion in cash from its stock portfolio in 2023. Most of this would be coming from dividends. The WSJ report said that a major chunk of this cash would come from some famous dividend stocks that Buffett has huge stakes in.About $1.1 billion would be coming from Chevron, in which Buffett has a huge stake (more on that later in the article). The WSJ report also mentioned that Buffett would collect $700 million each from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while the Oracle of Omaha will collect about $500 million from Kraft Heinz. From American Express, the billionaire’s check would give him about $363 million.Story continuesAll of this looks very simple at the surface. Just find famous dividend companies, invest in them and collect your payments, right? But if it were that simple Warren Buffett would lose his charm and charisma and the world won’t line up to listen to his advice.Buffett's Secret Sauce: ""The Weeds Wither Away in Significance as the Flowers Bloom""In a letter penned last year, Warren Buffett told about his “secret” of success in dividend investing under a heading “The Secret Sauce.” Buffett’s words sum up decades of wisdom and his foresight.Here’s what he said:""In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""There are several other dividend stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in addition to the famous dividend-paying companies we mentioned above. In this article we are going to take a look at all of the important dividend-paying companies in Buffett's portfolio. Dividend payments from these companies would help the legendary investor get $5.7 billion in cash this year.Warren Buffett's Top Dividend PicksOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Berkshire’s 13F portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top dividend-paying companies in which the fund had stakes. The list is ranked in ascending order of the stake values of Berkshire in these companies. Some notable names in the list include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).Warren Buffett's $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks15.

This initiative was developed as part of the U.S.-UAE’s Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) program that seeks to catalyze global innovation in climate-smart agriculture.The manufacture of fertilizers, which are essential to crop yields, is a significant contributor to the lifecycle GHG footprint of global food production. For example, one study(1) estimated that nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing accounts for about 30% of the lifecycle GHG emissions associated with the production of a loaf of bread.To address the GHG footprint of food production, both companies will leverage CF Industries’ investments to produce ammonia, which is the building block of nitrogen-based fertilizer products, with lower Scope 1 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. They will also leverage CHS’ extensive distribution network to place low- and zero-carbon fertilizers with growers. The companies expect to work together to promote the use of low-GHG nitrogen fertilizer to help farmers and crop end users, such as consumer product goods companies and ethanol producers, reduce the overall carbon footprint of agriculture.""Decarbonized fertilizer is the future of how we sustainably supply and produce the goods that humanity needs,"" said Bert Frost, senior vice president, sales, supply chain and market development, CF Industries. ""The advantage of using decarbonized fertilizer is that we can measure the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with its production and transfer that attribute to the farmer who can then provide crops to their customers that have a quantifiably lower GHG footprint. This will enable us to develop a certifiable decarbonized agricultural value chain.""Story continues""We recognize the importance of helping growers optimize resources as they produce food the world needs,"" said Brian Schouvieller, senior vice president commercial trade and risk management at CHS. ""Nitrogen fertilizer is critical to plant growth; zero or low-carbon fertilizer can be an important tool as we pursue solutions that help growers simultaneously achieve their crop production and sustainability goals.""Since 2020, CF Industries has advanced industry-leading projects to decarbonize its ammonia production network and position the Company to supply a substantial volume of clean ammonia within the next few years. This includes leveraging carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies at its Donaldsonville Complex where CF Industries is constructing a CO2 dehydration and compression facility to enable the capture and permanent sequestration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year, which is expected to begin in 2025. Additionally, CF Industries is constructing North America’s first commercial scale green ammonia capacity at its Donaldsonville Complex, enabling up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia production beginning in 2024.(1)https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201712About CF Industries Holdings, Inc.At CF Industries, our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable green and blue hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement and other industrial activities. Our manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, an unparalleled storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy.

17,8e2b5d3b-1e16-3ed3-887b-35344b69125b,CF,2023-05-12,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at an All-Time Low in May,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-buy-113041452.html,1683545441,STORY,"['VZ', 'GLW', 'EXR', 'UNP', 'CF', 'CHK']","[Now is an excellent time to research the top blue-chip stocks to buy for the long haul.It’s safe to say that investors are stuck in a market that shows little conviction. This is frustrating for bulls and bears. One problem is valuation. Many stocks still are trading at a premium to the market. This includes some blue-chip stocks. Some, but not all. And that’s where there’s an opportunity for investors who have the patience to look for the top blue-chip stocks to buy. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-chip stocks have a better chance of revenue and earnings growth. The latter is the mother’s milk of stock price growth.In order to find the best blue-chip stocks to buy now, I used a stock screener to find large-cap stocks that paid a dividend with a yield of over 2% and was trading within 10% of its 52-week low.The list gave me a diverse list of companies and I’ve picked what may be the top seven picks for investors looking for a place to get keep their portfolio growing in a market beset by stagflation.GLWCorning$31.48VZVerizon Communications$37.83WYWeyerhauser$29.67EXRExtra Space Storage$154.74CHKChesapeake Energy$78.64CFCF Industries$69.64UNPUnion Pacific$201.23Corning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comCorning (NYSE:GLW) sells its products through several channels. Its products have applications in many markets. This makes the company less affected by weakness in any one sector. Plus, an overview of Corning’s financials shows it distributes its revenue, which was about $14 billion in 2022, relatively evenly across all of its channels. That means investors can count on Corning to deliver consistent revenue and rising earnings. This can offset the fact that at 29x earnings, investors are paying a premium for GLW stock.  Analysts project earnings growth of 20.5% which should help fuel the projected 20% upside for GLW stock. The earnings growth should also be enough to support the company’s dividend. Corning currently offers an attractive 3.5% yield and has been increasing its dividend for the last 13 years.  Story continuesVerizon (VZ) Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is becoming an increasingly polarizing stock. Some investors point out, perhaps correctly, that the company operates in a very competitive business where there’s little to differentiate one company from another aside from price. And that will likely eat into earnings.  The company continues to have a juicy dividend that currently yields 6.98%. Verizon has increased its dividend in each of the last 18 years. Analysts are projecting earnings growth of 0.21% this year. That’s not spectacular, but it’s “enough” growth to continue increasing the dividend. With that in mind, Verizon is a compelling stock for income-oriented investors. Analysts are forecasting a 25.3% upside in VZ stock in the next 12 months. The dividend and potential stock price growth may not be enough to attract you. But the icing on the cake may be that Verizon trades at just 7.28x earnings which makes it very undervalued to the market.  Weyerhauser (WY) Weyergaeuser logo on a smartphone with a keyboard in the background.Source: rafapress / ShutterstockWeyerhauser (NYSE:WY) is a conglomerate in the forest products industry. This is a cyclical industry, but as Chris Lau analyzed for InvestorPlace in January, the cycle is likely to work in Weyerhauser’s favor. Customers will need to replenish inventory. And they are likely to ensure they have enough lumber on hand with the trucking and logging industries still not firing on all cylinders.  Weyerhauser’s first quarter earnings report suggests that expectation is on target. The company posted earnings per share (EPS) of 21 cents per share which was far above the 12 cents per share expected. Revenue also beat expectations, coming in at $1.90 billion which was larger than the $1.86 billion expected.  That may explain why analysts are forecasting 45.78% earnings growth in 2023. And that also supports expectations for 27.8% share price growth for WY stock. Weyerhauser has a dividend yield of 2.63% and has a P/E ratio of around 16x earnings.  Extra Space Storage (EXR) Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) is a real estate investment trust.Investors have to be selective with REITs at the moment, but Extra Space Storage looks like a sound bet. One of the company’s core businesses is in the public storage space. Revenue for self-storage units tends to be sticky as consumers will always need a place to store their stuff. The company agreed to purchase LifeStorage in April. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. That may keep some pressure on the company’s earnings. That may be why analysts are projecting “only” 5% earnings growth this year. After the merger is complete the combined companies will make Extra Space Storage “the targest storage operation in the country with over 3,500 locations, over 264 million square feet and serving over two million customers.” Still, when investors are keenly interested in earnings, EXR stock looks like a good buy. It’s trading at around 23x earnings which is in line with the broader market. It also comes with an attractive dividend that currently has a 4.29% yield and has been increasing for 14 consecutive years.  Chesapeake Energy (CHK) Image of an internet browser with Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) homepage on it. The Chesapeake Energy logo on the page is amplified by a magnifying glass.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comFor the next stock on my list of top blue-chip stocks to buy I’m looking at the energy sector. Specifically, a very undervalued Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) which is trading at just 2.4x earnings.  Falling crude oil prices have been making oil stocks look attractive once again. You know about the big oil names that have been generating large profits and issuing share buybacks and generous dividends to its shareholders.  But if you’re looking for a real value in the sector, you may want to look at CHK stock. As many investors remember, the company came out of bankruptcy in 2021. Since then, investors have been rewarded with an 85% return not including the company’s dividend. The company had a blowout year in 2022 as natural gas prices soared. 2023 has been a different story and the company’s forecasts are for lower output. Still institutional investors bought the stock at a 2:1 clip in the last 12 months. That’s likely to put a floor on CHK stock and investors can capture a solid dividend with a 2.86% yield.  CF Industries (CF) a photo of vast farmlandCF Industries (NYSE:CF) is a U.S.-based producer of agricultural fertilizers. The company should benefit at a time when the government is looking to ensure that companies can onshore their supply chains. That’s not reflected in the CF stock price. The stock is down 31% in the last 12 months and about 20% in 2023 alone.  At some point investors will look to value and that’s where CF Industries is likely to shine. The stock is trading at just 4.37x earnings. That’s down from the 7x earnings it was at just a few months ago.  But sometimes stocks are cheap for a reason. Is that the case with CF stock? It could be. Of all the stocks on this list, it’s the only one that is projected to have negative earnings growth in 2023. But analysts still project a 44% upside for the stock. That and a dividend with a 2.86% yield that is well supported by the company’s free cash flow makes this a compelling buy.   Union Pacific (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is the last stock on my list of the top blue-chip stocks to buy now. Railroad stocks have been under pressure as the supply chain issues that emerged during the pandemic are still getting untangled. Union Pacific hasn’t been spared. UNP stock is down nearly 40% in the last 12 months.  There are signs, however, that the stock may be bottoming. And that may be because the spending from the government’s Infrastructure Bill is working its way into the economy. That would be bullish for railroad stocks in general. Although analysts only forecast about 9% growth in UNP stock, the company has a stable dividend that currently yields $2.64 percent. It also has an annual payout of $5.20 per share. And it’s increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years. That streak will continue as the company has pledged to pay 45% of its future earnings as a dividend to shareholders.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

18,b2e68277-58e7-3862-ba3c-b3e206bb7dbb,CTAS,2023-05-12,Returns On Capital Are A Standout For Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-standout-cintas-nasdaq-120013924.html,1683892813,STORY,['CTAS'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Cintas' (NASDAQ:CTAS) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Cintas:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$8.5b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).Thus, Cintas has an ROCE of 25%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Commercial Services industry average of 8.5%. See our latest analysis for Cintas roceIn the above chart we have measured Cintas' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cintas.What Does the ROCE Trend For Cintas Tell Us?Cintas' ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 55% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.What We Can Learn From Cintas' ROCETo sum it up, Cintas is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And a remarkable 175% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Cintas that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

The company’s operating margin in the quarter was impacted by an unfavorable product mix from lower PCIOL sales in South Korea, higher R&amp;D investment following the acquisition of Aerie and a negative 1.3 percentage point impact from currency.Story continuesFinancial PositionAlcon exited the first quarter of 2023, with cash and cash equivalents of $889 million compared with $980 million at the end of fourth-quarter 2022.The cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the first quarter was $85 million compared with $66 million a year ago. Free cash flow totaled $19 million at the end of first quarter 2023 against an outflow of $52 million a year ago.2023 OutlookAlcon updated its 2023 outlookThe company maintained its net sales projection in the range of $9.2-$9.4 billion, indicating growth of 6-8% at CER from 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s revenues is pegged at $9.24 billion.Alcon raised its projection of core EPS in the range of $2.55-$2.65, suggesting growth of 20-24% at CER over 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.59 per share.Our TakeAlcon exited the first quarter of 2023 with earnings and revenues beating the estimates. Within the Surgical segment, growth was driven by strong consumables and equipment sales.  Consumables net sales increased led by favorable market conditions across geographies and price increases. Within Vision care, the upside was driven by a continued growth in silicone hydrogel contact lenses, including the Precision1 and Total product families, and price increases. Consistent growth in silicone hydrogel contact lenses, including the Precision1 and Total product families and price increases.However, growth in net sales across all segments continued to be marred by unfavorable currency impacts.

WBA is gaining from persistent partnership growth and a strong focus on strategic execution. The upbeat 2023 guidance looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 26.8% compared with a 28.8% fall of the industry and a 4.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $28.92 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 2.48% on average. However, the company’s long-term projected growth rate of 3% remains behind the industry’s growth projection of 5.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayNew Alliances Look Strategic: The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial. The Prothena partnership follows Walgreens’ vision to work with all the stakeholders to develop and evaluate effective therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.The same month, the U.S. Healthcare segment of Walgreens and VillageMD announced the expansion of Village Medical at Walgreens into Colorado, with three new primary care practices, two in Fort Collins and a third in Longmont. Village MD’s physicians and Walgreens’ pharmacy team members work together to provide patients with cost-effective, expert care for chronic conditions and general illnesses and injuries.Long-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Per the January update, Walgreens Boots noted that U.S. Healthcare targets raised with Summit Health announcement on Nov 7, 2022, including fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5 billion to $16.0 billion, up from $11.0 billion to $12.0 billion previously and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the segment by the end of fiscal year 2023.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking beyond 2023, the company increased clarity into its long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond.Upbeat Guidance: The company projects adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45-$4.65. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.57.The company expects revenues to be $137.5 billion. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $134.6 billion.DownsidesPressure on Margin Continues: In the past few years, the slowdown in the generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margins on a significant level.Competitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds from increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been constant at $4.50.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $136.18 billion, suggesting a 2.6% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

CRL reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.78 for first-quarter 2023, reflecting a 1.1% rise from the year-ago earnings. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.3%.The result was primarily driven by higher revenues and operating income, partially offset by increased interest expense and a higher tax rate, as well as the impact of the Avian Vaccine divestiture.On a GAAP basis, earnings increased 11% year over year to $2.01 per share.RevenuesRevenues in the first quarter totaled $1.03 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.1%. The top line improved 12.6% from the year-ago number (up 15.4% organically, excluding the impact of acquisition, divestiture and foreign currency translation).Segment in DetailCharles River’s first-quarter total Research Models and Services (RMS) revenues of $199.8 million were up 13.2% year over year (up 6.8% organically). Organic revenue growth was driven by broad-based growth for small research models, research model services, and the Cell Solutions business.Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) revenues of $662.4 million rose 21.7% (up 23.6% organically). Organic revenue growth was mainly driven by broad-based growth in the Safety Assessment business on meaningful price increases and higher study volume.Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. QuoteManufacturing Solutions revenues totaled $167.3 million, down 13.4% year over year (down 1.8% organically). The organic revenue decline was due to lower revenues in the CDMO business, which faced a challenging year-over-year comparison due to commercial readiness milestones in the first quarter of last year, and the Biologics Testing Solutions business, which experienced lower-than-anticipated testing volumes at the beginning of the year and a difficult comparison associated with last year’s COVID-related testing revenues. These werepartially offset by revenue growth in the Microbial Solutions business.Story continuesMarginsThe gross profit in the reported quarter was $377.7 million, up 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. However, gross margin of 36.7% contracted 17 basis points (bps) year over year on a 12.9% rise in the total costs of the company.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 16.5% to $174.8 million.Adjusted operating income totaled $202.8 million, reflecting an 8.6% rise from the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin in the first quarter contracted 74 bps to 19.7%.Liquidity and Cash PositionCharles River exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $201.6 million compared with $233.9 million at the end of 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the first quarter was $109.4 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $102.6 million.2023 GuidanceThe company has narrowed its 2023 guidance.For 2023, revenue growth is now expected in the band of 2-4.5% (from the earlier band of 1.5-4.5%) on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 5-7.5% (4.5-7.5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.08 billion, indicating a 2.7% rise from 2022.Adjusted EPS for 2023 is now expected in the range of $9.90-$10.90 ($9.70-$10.90). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.18.Our TakeCharles River exited the first quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The results highlighted a more than 15% organic revenue growth, driven by strength across the DSA and RMS business segments. The company registered robust growth in small research models, research model services and the Cell Solutions business.On the flip side, the contraction of both margins and escalating costs are concerning. Headwinds associated with foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and interest expense due to a rising interest rate environment increase concerns.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCharles River currently carries Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $19 million, suggesting a decline of 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark is pegged at breakeven.

Price and EPS SurpriseDecisionPoint Systems Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDecisionPoint Systems Inc. price-eps-surprise | DecisionPoint Systems Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderDecisionPoint’s extensive product portfolio of managed services, and professional services like consulting, staging and deployment installation is likely to gain traction. Rising complexities of creating, installing and managing a mobile solution have resulted in this upside for DPSI. Steady momentum witnessed for the company’s recurring revenue SaaS solutions, including packaged and custom-developed software, is likely to have favored first-quarter performance.Increasing adoption of its products and services across verticals like grocery and specialty retail, healthcare, distribution and transportation, along with geographic expansion, is a tailwind.Synergies from acquisitions also bode well. DPSI concluded two buyouts — Advanced Mobile Group and Boston Technologies — in 2022 to boost its position in the lucrative transportation and direct-store delivery verticals.In the quarter under review, the company completed the acquisition of Macro Integration Services which provides hardware, software and project services solutions mainly to companies in the retail sector. It also serves scales grocery, quick-service restaurants or QSR and convenience stores verticals.

However, it does endure the multi-pronged challenge of remaining competitive with the giant that is Amazon looming large in the e-commerce space.Here: 8 Companies Behind Costco’s Kirkland Brand ProductsMore: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchUnderstandably, shoppers may flock to Amazon and other big-box retailers in search of the best prices. This raises the question: What are the best buys at Walmart in terms of not only cost, but also quality? GOBankingRates turned to Walmart superfans to get the full scoop on the best buys at their favorite store.Mens Jeans by GeorgeJeans can be really expensive (hello Rag &amp; Bone) — but not at Walmart. “I love their reasonably priced jeans, which are only $19.99,” said Michael Rotman, content manager at The Emt Spot. “These jeans cost significantly less than high-end brands but are comparable.”Tyson Chicken NuggetsA 2-lb bag of Tyson chicken nuggets costs $6.98 at Walmart, which is considerably less than what Target charges for the same product. “I love Tyson chicken nuggets because they’re delicious and easy to prepare,” said Daniel Nyquist, the chief marketing officer at Crosslist, who ranks this item among his favorite Walmart buys. “Just throw them in the oven or microwave and you’re good to go!”The Nutri Ninja Pro BlenderAt Walmart, the Ninja Nutri-Blender Pro with Auto-iQ, 1100-Peak-Watt, Personal Blender is on sale for $79.95 — a deal that Nyquist swears by.“This blender is amazing! It does everything from smoothies to soups and juices, and it’s super easy to clean up after making food in it,” Nyquist said. “The price is $80 at Walmart, but other places sell it for $100 or more.”Dollar Tree: 12 High-Quality Items To Buy in MayFishing LicensesThis may be news to you, but Walmart sells fishing licenses. Buying one there can be much easier than going through a state department.Story continues“It’s the same price as it would cost you at the department of wildlife or natural resources in your state, but it is a lot more convenient to be able to go into the Sports &amp; Outdoors counter at your local Walmart store and get a license,” said Rick Wallace, founder at Tackle Village. “Remember to take some ID.”Black Friday TVsWalmart consistently rolls out powerhouse sales for Black Friday, and these are particularly noteworthy when shopping for a TV.“In 2020, Walmart offered a 50-inch Class 4K UHD Smart TV for the price of $148,” said Shanal Aggarwal, chief commercial officer at TechAhead. “This represented a savings of $130 in comparison to the standard price of the television.”Ibuprofen (and Other OTC Medicines) by EquateIf you have a headache or other ache and need some Ibuprofen, consider getting the Equate brand at Walmart. You can get a 100-count of 200mg pills for just $2.12.“[Equate health items] perform equally well as name-brand goods while being more affordable,” said Derrick Hathaway, sales director at VEM Medical, who notes that a bottle of Advil with the same dosage can run you much more. For instance, Target sells it for $12.29.Theater Box CandiesWalmart has a sizable collection of classic theater box candies. Most are just about $1.24 a pop, which is less than what they cost at dollar stores.“These are honestly great if you’re worried about discipline or portion control, but they’re also so awesome for keeping on hand for movie nights at home to make the experience more realistic,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com.Malt-o-Meal CerealsAnother favorite Walmart buy of Ramhold’s is the Malt-o-Meal cereals.“Especially the Dyno-Bites and Honey Graham Toasters, as they’re 32 oz bags for just [$5.76],” Ramhold saud. “These are a super affordable way to indulge in the nostalgic favorites of childhood and Walmart has a ton of different varieties of this cereal, whereas other stores may not carry as many flavors. Not only do they have more flavors but they also have the best prices — shopping elsewhere will mean paying $5.89 or more for the exact same product.”Generic CookiesPlenty of folks are loyal to name-brand cookies only, but if you’re up for giving generic a spin, check out Walmart’s selection.“Personal favorites include the iced oatmeal cookies ($1.88 for 18 oz) and fudge-striped cookies ($1.73 for 11.5 oz),” Ramhold said. “If you feel really strongly about the name-brands and can taste the difference, you can at least reserve the generics for kids as they likely won’t care one way or another. Plus Walmart also has a couple of Girl Scout knockoffs including fudge mint cookies ($1.73 for 10 oz) and caramel coconut and fudge cookies ($2.08 for 8.5 oz), so you can get a Thin Mint and Samoa fix any time of year.”More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 9 Walmart Buys You Have To Make, According to Superfans]"

29,74d7e8c3-2a05-362c-ae24-987b6335293c,WMT,2023-05-12,Walmart (WMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q1 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-expected-beat-earnings-140002728.html,1683813602,STORY,['WMT'],"[The market expects Walmart (WMT) to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $148.62 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walmart?For Walmart, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Walmart will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walmart would post earnings of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of +12.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walmart appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

This takes the dividend yield to 2.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Microchip Technology's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, Microchip Technology was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 17.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMicrochip Technology Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.702 total annually to $1.53. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.1% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Microchip Technology has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 49% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Microchip Technology Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy.As the global information technology revolution heats up and more and more companies embrace Cloud computing, AI, digital marketing, automation and web technologies for their business, the information technology services sector stands to benefit in the years to come. Bloomberg Intelligence in a survey of 3,038 executives across different industries found that businesses, small and large, are expected to keep increasing their IT spend as they plan to stay ahead in the technology race. A whopping 61% of respondents in the survey said that they plan to increase their tech spending.One of the biggest areas where companies plan to increase their spending is cybersecurity as companies resolve to protect their online assets and customer data. Because of this trend, as we will see later in the article, several small and big IT services companies have started offering cybersecurity services.Another important area where companies are planning to pour their dollars is Cloud computing, where Amazon and Microsoft will continue to take the lead, according to the survey. But in addition to these Cloud giants, several IT services companies thrive because of the Cloud industry as they help businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to Cloud systems and maintain their operations. Some notable companies in this domain are ServiceNow, Oracle and DXC.While companies are poised to increase IT spending, the sector wasn’t immune to the inflation surge and global economic crisis that wreaked havoc on the markets in 2022 and continue to hammer small and large companies in 2023. Gartner earlier this year estimated that worldwide IT spending will reach $4.5 trillion in 2023. This shows a 2.4% growth from the previous year, but was down from Gartner’s previous growth projections of 5.1%.Story continuesSpending on business software and IT was expected to account for a whopping $2.16 trillion in projected IT spending in 2023, according to Gartner. This shows that importance of IT services. Despite difficult odds companies need IT services to scale and expand their operations and even to cut costs.Consulting is another area that is thriving withing the IT services industry. The Gartner report says within IT services, spending on consulting services was expected to reach $264 billion this year, up 6.7% from 2022.Gartner said that inflation was eroding the spending capabilities of companies and causing layoffs at several B2C companies.The Gartner report shows that companies are expected to spend more on software and IT and reduce spend dollars when it comes to devices and hardware. The software and IT services segments are expected to grow 9.3% and 5.5% in 2023, respectively, according to Gartner.Given all the hullaballoo around AI, IT services companies are not silent about this new trend. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet in the company’s earnings call with analysts in March talked about Accenture’s AI initiatives:“We are continuing to use AI in the way we run our business, for example, in how we look at our accounts payable and receivables and finding ways where we can optimize to have better efficiencies there. We are using it today in the way we are delivering our consulting services as well and definitely very much so in how we look at sales and being able to predict based on lots of factors. Should we be running after the sale or not, or can we show the data that these …. is not the right kind of sale, we are not the right fit. So, we have increasingly been using AI, both in how we deliver services as well as in how we run ourselves.Of course, our SynOps platform for operations is also AI-enabled. It’s one of the reasons why clients turn to us because it’s helping them digitize faster. They are not having to build these things. So, long-term, we see these technology changes, things like generative AI is playing to our strengths because to use these technologies, it requires deep understanding of the industry, the use cases, the process changes. When people talk about the new kinds of generative AI, which we are super excited about, being like a co-pilot to human beings, the entire process has to be changed in order to make that work. You have got to up-skill the people and you have to be able to do all of that in a very responsible way.""Photo by Science in HD on UnsplashMethodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 12 IT services stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy12.

Shell Plc's shut-in of its 375,000-bpd Zydeco line in the Gulf of Mexico last month because of a leak also reduced supplies, traders and analysts said.Cash prices for Mars Sour, a key sour grade, have climbed recently, firming on Tuesday to a $1.60 premium to U.S. crude futures, the strongest since September 2020, traders said.""We see sour demand being quite strong globally,"" said Jenna Delaney, head of North American crude at consultancy Energy Aspects. New refinery capacity coming online east of the Suez Canal also will increase the call for sour barrels ""for the remainder of the year,"" Delaney added.A lot of refiners in the U.S. Gulf Coast are configured to process the high sulfur crude, and are currently pulling in minimal sour barrels from the Middle East, instead ramping up Venezuelan crude imports, said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler.""Middle East barrels are priced so high as to deter any additional buying from U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, leaving them to search for sour seaborne barrels from predominantly Latin America,"" Smith said.Meanwhile, exports of popular U.S. and Canadian sour grades ramped up in March, mainly as Chinese refiners snapped up the barrels, Kpler data showed.Top U.S. refiners Valero Energy Corp and Marathon Petroleum Corp as well as BP Plc's Whiting refinery in the Midwest are top buyers of sour crude, said Hillary Stevenson, a senior director at IIR Energy.GRAPHIC: Chevron's exports of Venezuelan crudeIn April, Chevron Corp exported 140,876 barrels per day of Venezuela's heavy and sour oil, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon and PDVSA, under a U.S. license allowing the first imports in four years.Story continues""Our view is that more Chevron production from that region (Venezuela) will make its way into the Gulf,"" Gary Simmons, Valero Energy's chief commercial officer, said recently.An expected rise in Canadian production could add sour barrels to the market and ease premiums, refining executives said. But the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline next year will redirect more Canadian oil to the Pacific coast, instead of the U.S. Gulf Coast, Kpler's Smith said.(This story has been corrected to say OPEC+'s production cut is 1.16 million barrel per day instead of 500,000 in paragraph 2)(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly and Arathy Somasekhar; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

[=EUR]A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.""Lack of confidence in the economy is translating to a retreat to the safer dollar, and is also causing pessimism about oil demand,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.Concern mounted that the United States - the world's biggest oil consumer - will enter recession, with talks over the U.S. government's debt ceiling postponed and concern growing over another crisis-hit regional bank.The U.S. Federal Reserve will probably need to raise interest rates further if inflation stays high, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Friday, adding that data this month has not convinced her that price pressures are receding.Meanwhile, China's April consumer price data rose at a slower pace than in March, missing expectations, while deepening factory gate deflation refocused doubts about its recovery from COVID restrictions driving oil demand growth.The U.S. oil and natural gas rig count fell this week to its lowest in nearly a year, as gas rigs slumped by the most in a week since February 2016, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report on Friday.U.S. oil rigs fell by two to 586 this week, their lowest since June 2022, while gas rigs plunged by 16 to 141, their lowest April last year.Story continuesThe market drew some support from the forecast emerging supply deficit for the second half of the year, even as Iraq's oil minister Hayan Abdel-Ghani told Reuters on Friday he does not expect OPEC+ to decide on further production cuts when it next meets in Vienna on June 4.An OPEC report on Thursday said the producer group expects July-December demand for its own crude to be 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) higher than previously projected.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) kept its global oil demand forecast for 2023 unchanged on Thursday, expecting economic risks to be offset by higher Chinese demand growth.The market also drew support after U.S. energy secretary Jennifer Granholm signalled that the country could repurchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after completing a congressionally mandated sale next month.(This May 12 story has been corrected to say that oil prices fell for the fourth consecutive week, not third, in paragraph 1)(Additional reporting Rowena Edwards in London, Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo and Andrew Hayley in Beijing; Editing by David Goodman, Kirsten Donovan, Nick Macfie and Daniel Wallis)]"
40,6abd7a21-0345-3a6b-8521-2985a1a2c6cd,O,2023-05-12,Low-Quality Crude Sees Mysterious Price Rally,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/low-quality-crude-sees-mysterious-000000258.html,1683849600,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Middle Eastern oil producers are raising the export prices for their lower-grade crudes, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. And European buyers have no choice but to pay up—because the alternative is Russian oil, and they can’t have that.It is a curious case, as noted in another Bloomberg report on the issue, since normally, the lower the crude grade, the lower the price. Light, sweet crudes like WTI or Arab Super Light fetch higher prices from refiners because they are easier to process into fuels.Heavier crudes and crudes with higher sulfur content—sour crudes—are normally cheaper because their refining is a more complicated affair. Yet the refining business doesn’t follow this unshakeable logic. Refineries are calibrated to operate with certain types of oil, and a lot of European refineries were calibrated to operate with Russian Urals—a medium sour grade.Energy Intelligence sounded the alarm as early as last year in an article that noted that European refineries had for decades processed Urals and would have a hard time replacing it with similar crudes. Global markets were amply supplied with light sweet crudes, the report pointed out, but the supply of medium sour ones was tighter.A year later, it still is, according to the Bloomberg reports. And producers are responding the way sellers always respond when demand for their product surges. Iraq has raised the price of its Basrah Medium for European buyers to the highest in a year. Saudi Arabia also raised the price of its Arab Light, which is in fact a medium sour crude.Related: Trump Promises To ""Drill, Baby, Drill"" If ElectedAt the same time, in what would probably seem like a cruel move to Europeans, both Iraq and Saudi Arabia kept their prices unchanged for Asian buyers—who, to be fair, normally buy a lot more oil than European refiners, and now they’re also gobbling up Russian barrels, making it unwise for the Iraqis and the Saudis to raise prices to them.Story continuesIn addition to the replacement game that’s going on in international oil, there is also another factor: new refineries are coming on stream in the Middle East, so local consumption of various crudes is on the rise, leaving more limited volumes for export, as Bloomberg noted in a report that said the price changes in medium sour were taking traders by surprise.Some relief for European refiners came from the U.S., whose oil exports to Europe were set to reach a record in March at around 2 million barrels daily, but the fact is that U.S. oil production consists mostly of light, sweet crudes that can’t replace Urals at European refineries.They can’t replace heavy crudes for U.S. refineries, either, hence the United States’ continued dependence on imports of oil even after it became the world’s largest producer of the commodity.This means that the market of medium sour crude grades is set for an extended period of tight supply. Until some producers decide to boost output, but they have little motivation to do it, what with the EU’s and the UK’s plans for phasing out fossil fuel consumption. With such a context for future demand, producers are unlikely to invest in a production boost.This, in turn, means fuels will be more expensive for Europeans, and that would add fuel to already high inflation. A decline in benchmark oil prices would be a welcome respite but only a temporary one. Until refiners depend on imported sour crude from producer countries that make most of their money from their oil exports, they would be made to pay as much as the producers see fit.India and China, meanwhile, have access to discount Russian crude—all grades—and also cheap Middle Eastern crude, benefiting from both Europe’s questionable international policies and from internal competition in OPEC+. The EU might want to hurry up with replacing GDP with something else before the differences between its own GDP and China’s and India’s become too glaring.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Top 10 Countries With Largest Oil ReservesFuel Smuggling Out Of Iran Is ThrivingWhat Happened To Oil &amp; Gas Dealmaking In The First Quarter?Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

The OPEC slightly hiked its forecast for oil demand this year in its monthly report.Brent oil futures fell 0.3% to $74.78 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.1% to $70.81 a barrel by 22:06 ET (02:06 GMT). Both contracts were trading marginally lower for the week after notching losses over the past two weeks.Signs of a labor market slowdown in the U.S., coupled with renewed fears of a banking crisis in the country also weighed on oil markets.Broader market sentiment remained on edge amid continued discussions over raising the U.S. debt limit, as a June 1 deadline for a U.S. default approaches. But a Friday meeting between President Joe Biden and Republican policymakers now appeared to be postponed to next week, media reports showed.A sharp recovery in the dollar also dented oil markets, as signs that U.S. inflation remained sticky saw markets largely pare their expectations for any interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.A stronger dollar makes crude more expensive for international buyers, denting demand.U.S. inventory data provided mixed cues to markets this week, as steady drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) saw inventories unexpectedly rise over the past week.But steep declines in gasoline and distillate inventories indicated that U.S. fuel demand was picking up towards the summer season. Still, this provided only limited upside for prices.Story continuesSpeculation over the U.S. potentially refilling the SPR offered some support to oil prices this week, although the White House has so far provided scant cues on when it plans to begin buying crude.Related ArticlesOil struggles to recover as economic outlook darkensOil prices recover on short-covering, U.S. debt ceiling fears weighGold dented as markets rethink Fed rate cuts, copper slides]"

Energy stocks were the top performer last year. But almost halfway through 2023, they're completely reversing course. So is there an opportunity at these levels. Let's talk about it with Rob Thummel, Tortoise Senior Portfolio Manager.Rob, it's great to see you again. So certainly was a high flyer last year. This year it has been under a tremendous amount of pressure. Do you think we'll see a recovery soon?ROB THUMMEL: Well, I do, I do. And I think for this reason, number one, the energy sector is really essential. We need a lot more energy, both domestically and globally, for the economies to continue to grow. And that's not going to change. It hasn't changed in decades. And it won't change for decades to come.But the number one fundamental reason why that the energy sector really is compelling and attractive to investors is there's a lot of cash flow from the sector. And so what that means for the sector is it's going to offer a lot of dividends and then also buybacks and stock buybacks. And so you've got those two factors, visible cash flow and really uncertain times like we are in right now. That usually means that those types of sectors will do fairly well over the next several months.AKIKO FUJITA: Rob, let's talk about what the demand picture looks like right now for oil. We've heard over and over, China, a potential big catalyst with their reopening. But you look at recent data. It does point to the fact that the ramp-up has been slower than expected. What's the timeline you're looking at right now? And how much upside do you see, especially with some of these bigger oil names, as a result of that?ROB THUMMEL: Yeah, so you've seen the oil markets trade off, clearly the oil price come down, the natural gas price come down, in the case of natural gas quite substantially. The first quarter is always tough for oil markets because you've got a lot of refineries that are offline. So oil demand drops temporarily.Story continuesThe whole world is waiting on when does the Chinese economy reopen. And it's gradually reopening. And so we expect the demand for oil globally in China to grow and accelerate throughout the rest of this year. Currently, the global oil market is probably slightly oversupplied. It's going to flip to being undersupplied sometime in the late second quarter or early third quarter.And when that happens, you're going to see it. When the oil market is undersupplied, typically you see a positive price response. So we would expect oil prices to rise a bit. And then how does that relate to the energy stocks themselves?Now, if you look at Exxon, Chevron, typically they trade higher when oil prices go higher, and other energy stocks, as well. So now with oil prices where they are, that's why we think at Tortoise it's an attractive time to be looking at the energy sector because prices are probably low. They're probably going higher. And that will just result in an uplift of all energy stocks.SEANA SMITH: Rob, I think there's also a big debate going on right now just in terms of how much power OPEC has when you compare it to historically speaking. And when you talk about the cuts that they announced, what that exactly means for the energy market how, big of a impact specifically do you see OPEC having on the energy market today?ROB THUMMEL: Well, they still cover, what, 40% of the market or something like that globally as far as production is concerned. And so yeah, they still have a pretty significant piece of the market share. They have a lot of information with regards to demand, both domestically, but more importantly, globally in terms of where oil demand is.So they can make moves as they see it, probably with better available information than any of us. And so I think they still do play an important role. The US will continue to grow production. The US is still important.The world still needs more US energy. It still needs more US oil, still needs more US natural gas. And that dynamic is not going to change any time in the next decade and beyond. So the US still plays a really important role.AKIKO FUJITA: Rob, let's talk a little bit more about clean energy stocks. We saw them rally in a big way on the back of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Still a lot of assessment happening about to what extent that could be a further catalyst. But if we slice it between sort of solar, even hydrogen, what are you liking in that space? And is this actually a good time to get in right now?ROB THUMMEL: Yeah, well, so at Tortoise, we look at kind of an all-of-the-above approach to decarbonization. The world needs to decarbonize. So solar's important. Wind's important. And those are happening right now. In other words, the world's decarbonizing right now, using more and solar and wind to generate electricity, using less coal.In the future, we think there's a lot of potential for things, as you mentioned, like hydrogen and carbon capture. That's important as well. What you need to help accelerate the growth in those areas are infrastructure. And you need more infrastructure and pipelines to be able to transfer the carbon, pipelines to transfer the hydrogen. So we think that that's really important and critical and in order to get the wind-- or sorry, the hydrogen and carbon capture, even with the credits, more competitive.Biofuels are also interesting as well. You look at what's going on with renewable natural gas and renewable fuels, basically creating transportation fuels where the raw material is not a fossil fuel. Instead, it's things like used cooking oil. That's really interesting to us as well. And so those are all opportunities for investors, as we see, over the next-- well, really over the next decade as well.AKIKO FUJITA: How do you play this space though?ROB THUMMEL: Well, yeah, there's that. That's a good question. Well, what I would say is, in a lot of ways, you can play it through some of the major indices or some of the ETFs that focus on solar or wind.Some of the specific companies? Well, big picture, Chevron and Exxon are doing a lot in this space as well. But obviously, they're predominantly oil and gas companies. So you can play it through, frankly, Chevron and Exxon because, if any of this is going to accelerate, you're going to need Chevron and Exxon to participate.But if you want to play pure play, whether it's renewable fuels or biofuels or things like that, there are companies like a Green Plains, which is an example of a company that's actually predominantly biofuels, specifically focused on some of the biofuels that are going to grow, like ethanol and ethanol production and things along those lines.There's obviously some pure plays on the hydrogen side as well. They're a little more startup at this point. And so from our perspective, we think probably the best way to play it is through the major energy players because those are the companies that are going to benefit the most longer-term and make the biggest difference.SEANA SMITH: All right, Rob Thummel, Tortoise Senior Portfolio Manager, thanks so much.]"

Those shutting between 2035 and 2040 would be required to co-fire with 40% gas by 2030.The Environmental Protection Agency projects the plan would cut emissions from coal plants and new gas plants by 617 million tonnes between 2028 and 2042, the equivalent of reducing the annual emissions of 137 million passenger vehicles.The EIA projected that the combined capacity from solar and wind will more than triple by 2050, making up between 40% and 69% of U.S. electricity generation. Coal would still provide between 1% and 8% of electricity in 2050, due to its ability to operate around the clock without dependence on the availability of sunlight or wind.

This effort is separate from the Fed’s annual bank stress tests.Six of the largest US banks — Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) — are being asked to assess the impact of everything from hurricanes and wildfires to heatwaves and higher average temperatures on residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios over the next year. The Fed calls these ""physical risk scenarios.""Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve member Chris Waller, speaks during a conversations with leaders from organizations that include nonprofits, small businesses, manufacturing, supply chain management, the hospitality industry, and the housing and education sectors at the Federal Reserve building, Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed is also asking banks to evaluate the impact of stresses from the transitioning to a lower carbon economy on corporate and commercial real estate loan portfolios over a 10-year horizon.Waller said Thursday that he does think it’s important to continue doing academic research regarding the role that climate plays in economic outcomes. But he said he doesn't believe risks posed by climate change merit special treatment from the Fed.Falling property values tied to physical climate risks like hurricanes and fires could result in losses for banks, he said, but ""there is a growing body of literature that suggests economic agents are already adjusting behavior to account for risks associated with climate change.""Story continuesWaller said the Fed already tests for severe declines in real estate values in its annual stress tests.In last year's stress test, which envisioned a drop of more than 25% in real estate values, the largest banks were able to absorb nearly $100 billion in losses on loans collateralized by real estate, in addition to another half a trillion dollars of losses on other positions, says Waller.“Based on what I've seen so far, I believe that placing an outsized focus on climate-related risks is not needed, and the Federal Reserve should focus on more near-term and material risks in keeping with our mandate.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The program was created and funded by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) and The PG&amp;E Corporation Foundation (The PG&amp;E Foundation).Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)The student graduates successfully completed a rigorous academic program that began last fall. Each will be awarded college scholarships of $8,000. All of the students have been accepted to college, and some have been accepted to the University of California, Berkeley.Last year, in an effort to address wealth inequality and the racial wealth gap affecting African Americans in particular, PG&amp;E and The PG&amp;E Foundation partnered with the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley and Berkeley Executive Education, Mills College at Northeastern University, and Amenti Capital Group to prepare African American high school students from Oakland and the Greater Bay Area for future financial success and academic leadership. The pilot supports PG&amp;E and The PG&amp;E Foundation's Better Together Giving Program dedicated to bolstering people, the planet, and California's prosperity, and ensuring a safe and inclusive future for all.Otis Ward, a senior at McClymonds High School in Oakland, is one of the students to complete the program, receive a scholarship and earn acceptance to UC Berkeley.""Opportunities such as the PG&amp;E scholarship are essential, especially for Black Oakland students that are underserved within our community. I'm really excited to have completed this program as it can be a stepping stone for fellow young Black youth from my West Oakland community who are striving for post-secondary education, just like myself,"" said Ward, one of the 24 program graduates.Story continuesPG&amp;E created the program after two years of planning as a racial justice initiative following the George Floyd tragedy to help address economic challenges faced by African Americans, and together with The PG&amp;E Foundation provided $500,000 in funding through its community charitable Better Together Giving Program. Students took courses taught by Berkeley Haas professors Panos Patatoukas and Sunil Dutta and financial industry professionals on topics including personal finance, capital markets and wealth creation, financial data analysis and investments. African American Haas undergraduates also mentored the high schoolers.Mills College at Northeastern University TRIO Programs recruited the student participants as part of the Upward Bound program — which helps underserved high school students and first in their families attending college to succeed — and the Mills Educational Talent Search — which supports high school students achieving their higher education goals.The curriculum was developed in collaboration with Patatoukas and Jason Miles, an African American venture capitalist with more than 25 years of experience in the financial services industry and founder of Amenti Capital Group.""Mitigating the problem of access inequality and addressing the wealth gap in the African American community has been the driving force of our joint efforts with PG&amp;E and The PG&amp;E Foundation,"" Patatoukas said. ""We are excited to make financial education more accessible, and we are committed to continue to foster diverse, equitable, and inclusive learning environments. I look forward to congratulating this first graduating class of Oakland and Bay Area students from this impactful program.""""There is a tremendous pool of talented students who represent shining examples of future African American leaders. They must be empowered with practical investing tools and knowledge about risk-return trade-offs early in their lives. We are energized by this unique opportunity to catalyze generational wealth creation alongside like-minded partners and this first graduating class of students,"" said Miles.According to the Disparities in Wealth by Race and Ethnicity 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the typical white family has eight times the wealth of a typical Black family. The survey cites a number of complex societal factors across generations, including how individual savings and investment decisions contribute to wealth accumulation.""It's truly rewarding to know these students have gained this critical knowledge because this type of information is needed to help them achieve economic parity. We are conscious of how the racial wealth gap contributes to inequality, and we know that the educational opportunities this program provides will be a significant catalyst to helping them to create generational wealth. We congratulate this inaugural class of high school students, and we are excited to support them with their future academic pursuits,"" said Jimi Harris, PG&amp;E Community Relations Chief and program creator.The program is designed to provide wealth creation tools through an advanced financial education curriculum for high school students, and also to support post-secondary education achievement through scholarships for participants, funded by PG&amp;E. The program can serve as a model for future high school education curriculum.About PG&amp;E Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Michael FlorinThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain caution statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.Story continuesRobert J. ThomsonThank you, Mike. Before discussing our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, it is particularly important to begin by noting that today marks the 44th day in captivity for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was wrongfully, willfully detained in Russia. I would like to express our thanks and that of Almar Latour, Emma Tucker and all at Dow Jones for the outstanding support shown for Evan and his family by the U.S. and many other governments, media companies, journalism organizations and concerned principled people around the world. We trust that justice and common sense will prevail, and that Evan will soon be released.Turning now to the third quarter results. We began to see meaningful improvements compared to the prior quarter with certain macro and sectoral trends more positive and our cost-cutting program beginning to gain traction. For context, these earnings follow record revenues and profitability in fiscal 2022, and we have been confronting the challenges of foreign exchange volatility, a surge in interest rates, persistent inflation and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Our results demonstrate the fundamental differences in the character of News Corp compared with other media companies. In a period in which advertising activity was clearly insipid in certain parts of the world, our core nonadvertising revenue was particularly robust, highlighted by a 38% increase in revenues at the Dow Jones Professional Information business. For the quarter, total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down only 2% year-over-year as compared to the 7% decline in Q2. Adjusted revenues, excluding our acquisitions and distinctly unfavorable ForEx movements, equaled those of last year. Meanwhile, profitability was $320 million, down 11% despite a tough prior year comparison and the just articulated external pressures. As for the company-wide cost reduction drive, we are well advanced in taking the difficult but necessary step of reducing headcount by 5%, which is now expected to yield more than $160 million in annualized savings by the end of this calendar year. In addition, we are strictly scrutinizing spending across all categories and expect further savings as we strive for efficiency and efficacy. There has been much discussion, some of it was enlightened, some not so, about the potential impact of generative AI, and there is no doubt that it will profoundly affect the media business. Candidly, generative AI may pose a challenge to our intellectual property and to the future of journalism. As those who've experimented with ChatGPT will be aware, the answers are only as insightful and factual as the source material and are more retrospective than contemporary. Given those precepts, we see 3 areas in which our content will be used by generative AI creators whose products will be enhanced by our IP for which we should be compensated.Firstly, our content will inevitably be used as has already been exploited to train AI engines. Secondly, specific examples of our content will be surfaced in response to users' AI queries. And thirdly and crucially, our content will certainly be aggregated and synthesized and those answers monetized by other parties. We expect our fair share of that monetization.Generative AI cannot be degenerative AI. The digital debate over content and journalism has evolved significantly in the past few years. And we appreciate the social and commercial commitment of our partners at Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta. The A in AI cannot be ambiguity nor can the I represent ignorance. Integrity would be more apt, which brings us to Dow Jones, among the world's foremost and most trusted purveyors of business news, data and analysis.The third quarter reflected its robust revenue generation even in testing economic times. And as I mentioned, was highlighted by the burgeoning of our professional information business, which reported a 38% surge in revenues, including a 16% rise at our Risk &amp; Compliance business, and that number was negatively affected by ForEx fluctuations. Dow Jones has certainly benefited from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, which continued their high-margin growth in recent months. We will be expanding their product offerings over the next year with particular emphasis on renewables and carbon metrics, and we are confident of many years of strong growth ahead. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of all revenues at Dow Jones, a significant increase from the 60% level during fiscal 2018. Aside from the professional information business, digital subscriptions continue to grow up 9% to 3.3 million at The Wall Street Journal and up 10% to 4.3 million at Dow Jones as a whole, with total subscriptions now at 5.1 million despite print subscriptions, obviously being under some pressure.The strong performance overall came despite an insipid ad market in the U.S. with continued weakness in tech advertising, so we did see an improvement in demand in April. So the auguries have improved. Dare I say, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has been a catalyst for other U.S. financial institutions to try to reassure customers and highlight their own solidity. And The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and MarketWatch are vital platforms for any financial firm aspiring to bolster its credentials. In Australia, Foxtel Group continues to build on its streaming success. Streaming now accounts for 2/3 of the total Foxtel subscription base. And that revenue growth is more than offsetting the decline in broadcast. Fears that our world-class streaming products would be a catalyst for cannibalization have been unfounded. Broadcast churn is at near record low levels with Foxtel retail churn in March under 10%. That success is also a tribute to our marketing and customer service teams at Foxtel and to the leadership of Patrick Delany and Siobhan McKenna.As at the end of March, Binge, our entertainment streaming product, launched advertising on its basic service, adding a new lucrative revenue stream. Interest from advertisers has been ardent as the initial phase of packages were sold out. We have demand and seemingly some flexibility on pricing in the months and years ahead. After a couple of tough quarters, fortunes have certainly improved at HarperCollins with a bevy of bestsellers and some moderation of supply chain snafus. Margins were higher in the third quarter compared to the first half. We also have an attractive roster of books in this in upcoming quarters. So we believe we are on a journey to the sunlit uplands. Amazon's orders improved in the quarter, and our titles prospered in particular, Ron DeSanit's', The Courage to be Free; Barbara Kingsolver's, Demon Copperhead; as well as Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's, Never Never; and Ben Halls, Saved. In the fourth quarter, Kat Timpf is already topping bestseller list with You Can't Joke About That. If I could make a self-interested recommendation, it is worth a read or a listen. Last week, we also published the latest incarnation of the Magnolia Table Cookbook. We are justifiably optimistic about prospects for the Bridgerton prequel Queen Charlotte by Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes, which went on sale this week, coinciding with the launch of the new Netflix series. The News Media segment reported a substantial improvement over the second quarter with advertising in constant currency increasing 2%, though down 5% in U.S. dollars. This increase was a vastly different outcome to that of most media companies in most countries. We are confident that our teams are more skilled in sharing advertising insights across borders and platforms, and that innate intelligence is reflected in our revenue numbers. One success story is the sun.com, where total page views in the quarter surged 94% year-over-year, reaching close to 1 billion views. The site, which has benefited from the partnership with the New York Post and our other U.S. properties, has triumphed in tough times, and notably, The Sun's U.S. digital advertising revenues now exceed those of the British platform. In the U.K., connected listing hours at wireless hit an all-time high, reaching an average of 8.4 million per week in the quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year and reflective of our superb coverage of the Premier League, which reaches its seasonal crescendo in coming days, hopefully with an against-the-odds triumph by Arsenal. And as for the New York Post, the previously perennial lossmaker continues to be profitable in the third quarter and to build on its important influence on the national debate. Engagement at The Post digital properties rose 4% over the prior year to 690 million page views in March, providing a powerful platform for its compelling content. At Digital Real Estate Services, obviously enough, the interest rate surged and accompanying uncertainty in the housing market have had an impact in the U.S. and Australia, but these are not permanent conditions and the digitization of the property market is far from complete. There were signs of improvement in the market this quarter, but we understand that the increase in rates has had an impact on affordability and created uncertainty for potential house sellers and buyers. When that uncertainty evaporates, we'll be primed to take full advantage of the opportunity. In the midst of the challenges, realtor is focusing on adjacencies, particularly on the sell side and rental segments, and we are continuing to see benefits from the use of our media platforms, among others, the wsj.com, New York Post and the U.S. edition of The Sun to drive brand recognition and generate traffic. The result of that campaign was seen in the past quarter, and we expect they will continue to be seen in coming quarters. Since the campaign began in February, the project has generated more than 0.5 billion impressions, and showing the unique power we have to bolster brands and turbocharge traffic. Realtor.com also further integrated UpNest into its seller experiences in Q3, and is seeing significantly higher conversion rates. At REA, revenues were softer in Q3 compared to the prior year due to the lower listing volume that we are seeing encouraging signs with realestate.com.au, reaching almost 132 million visits in March, the highest total in 16 months and the fifth highest on record. With indications that prices and demand are again strengthening in Australia, we believe we are poised to prosper.And that is also true in India, where housing.com is the leading digital property platform and saw 21% year-over-year growth in average site visits in the quarter. It is worth noting this metric, as India has just passed China as the most populous country and continues to have relative political stability and enormous economic potential. As I said at the outset, there has been much tangible progress in the third quarter. And the auguries are certainly positive for coming quarters. We will absolutely focus on our core engines of growth and prioritize simplification, cost reductions and thoughtful capital stewardship. We remain committed to constantly reviewing our structure and to creating enduring value for our shareholders. And now to provide more insight into third quarter developments, I turn to Susan Panuccio.Susan Lee PanuccioThank you, Robert. Our financial results this quarter demonstrated tangible improvements from the first half, which combined with the implementation of our aggressive cost actions, should position News Corp well for fiscal 2024. We Third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down just 2% year-over-year, which was a significant improvement from the second quarter rate and included a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, third quarter adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year with improving trends at the News Media subscription video services and Book Publishing segments, offset by the decline at Digital Real Estate Services segment. Advertising trends were mixed across our geographies. Total segment EBITDA was $320 million, 11% lower compared to the prior year's record Q3 profits. Results included $7 million of professional fees related to the proposed merger with Fox and the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 15% versus the prior year.For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Before I discuss the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our headcount reduction program. Reductions across the business units will vary given the differing nature of our businesses and cost work done to date. We currently expect the annualized growth cost savings to exceed $160 million, up from our initial estimate of at least $130 million with the majority of the savings to be reflected in fiscal 2024. We also expect to incur approximately $90 million to $100 million of cash restructuring charges related to the headcount reductions in the second half of fiscal 2023. Moving on to the results of the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $363 million, down 13% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures on both the U.S. and the Australian housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $13 million or 3% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 26% to $102 million, impacted by lower revenues, the negative impact related to currency headwinds and higher costs related to REA India, partially offset by lower costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 24%. REA revenues were $222 million, which declined 10% on a reported basis or down 4% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower residential revenues and to a lesser extent, softness in financial services. In the quarter, Australia national residential buy listings were down 12%, with Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses increased uptake in premium products, including Premier Plus, favorable depth penetration and another robust performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Like our other businesses at News Corp, REA is taking steps to reduce expenses with a focus on discretionary operational spend and marketing costs. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $141 million, down 17% compared to the prior year. Real estate revenues were down 23%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflecting broader housing market challenges. Lead volume fell 30%, while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 24% to $72 million in the third quarter based on internal metrics, yet up from the $66 million in the second quarter. Realtor has been focusing on optimizing revenues via a prioritized set of initiatives while managing operating expenses as the business weathers ongoing market headwinds. Initiatives include enhancing media advertising placements, including implementing a broader partnership with the businesses across News Corp; optimizing lead allocation across markets; accelerating our go direct path for new homes; and building out the rentals vertical. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $477 million, down 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 2% versus the prior year, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 20% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and Binge. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to nearly 4.6 million at quarter end, up 6% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately 3 million, increasing 16% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 65% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Paid subscribers for Kayo reached a record of over 1.3 million, up 14% year-over-year. Net adds from the prior quarter improved to 183,000, the largest sequential increase in 7 quarters with the start of the popular winter sports codes in March. Revenues also benefited from a price rise implemented in February. Binge paid subscribers grew 22% year-over-year or 109,000 net adds from the last quarter to nearly 1.5 million subscribers, benefiting from the successful release of the Last of Us. As Robert mentioned, on March 30, Foxtel introduced advertising within the Binge Basic product. The product accounts for approximately 30% of all Binge subscribers. We expect a modest revenue contribution from advertising beginning in the fourth quarter.Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down 200 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%. In fact, Foxtel retail churn was just under 10% for March 2023. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 84. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $68 million was down 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 9%, reflecting higher sports costs due to contractual escalators and enhancements.Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted healthy top line growth in the third quarter with revenues of $529 million, up 9% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 80% of total revenues, up 3 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, impacted by weaker advertising revenues compared to the prior year. We are continuing to see very strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 38% year-over-year, reflecting the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, coupled with strong revenues from Risk &amp; Compliance. PIB revenues accounted for 37% of segment revenues. Risk &amp; Compliance revenues rose 16% despite a 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency, led by an increase in demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. The pipeline remains robust, most notably in EMEA. OPIS and CMA's strong revenue performance is helping reshape Dow Jones revenues to be more recurring as we have increased pricing across our customer base. As Robert mentioned, its carbon index offering continues to expand, and we expect will lead to the creation of new products for current and new customers. Retention rates for OPIS and CMA's products remained well over 90% in the quarter. Circulation revenues declined 1%. The modest decline was driven by lower print volumes and some softness in IBD. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 10% year-over-year or by 208,000 sequentially, the highest net adds since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The focus this year has been on the launch of bundles, which expanded to include IBD in the third quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $88 million and accounted for 17% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. Within advertising, digital fell 17% and print was down 8%, with notable impacts from the technology and finance categories, as we mentioned last quarter. While the advertising market remains challenged, we are seeing encouraging signs with the rate of decline abating. After hitting a low in December, each successive month showed an improvement, with March notably down mid-single digits, and we saw further improvements in April. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 24% to $109 million as cost growth moderated from the first half, albeit the business is still experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures. The results also reflect the lapping of transaction costs related to the OPIS acquisition last year. Segment EBITDA margins rose to over 20%. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 11%.At Book Publishing, revenues were flat at $515 million, driven by higher Christian book sales offset by foreign currency fluctuations. After a challenging first half of the year, we saw some positive trends with stability in Amazon orders in North America following the reset in the first half as well as stronger performance from several recent titles. Segment EBITDA declined 9% to $61 million. Costs rose approximately 1%, reflecting ongoing supply chain issues in North America, specifically in manufacturing, distribution and freight costs, which are now showing signs of moderation.The headcount initiative is well underway, which should result in lower employee costs in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, HarperCollins also settled a 3-month-long strike with the UAW. The backlist represents 60% of revenues for the quarter, up slightly from last year. Digital sales declined 3% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales, in line with the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 2%, and segment EBITDA fell over 7%.Turning to News Media. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% and included a $42 million or 7% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues rose 4%, improving from the prior quarter rate. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4% but rose 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit digital subscriber growth across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. Advertising trends improved this quarter as advertising revenues were down 5%, but gained 2% in constant currency. Advertising revenues at News U.K. rose 8% in constant currency, led by strong digital advertising performance which is continuing to benefit from the growing scale of the sun.com in the U.S. and an improved performance at The Times and Sunday Times. Advertising was flat at News Australia in constant currency and notably, both Australia and the New York Post benefited from an improvement in print advertising this quarter. Segment EBITDA of $34 million declined 13%, reflecting a much more modest decline from the first half rate as incremental year-over-year investments related to the TalkTV initiative in the U.K. and other digital initiatives in Australia slowed to approximately $13 million. Newsprint costs remain a challenge, having $40 million of negative impact this quarter from higher prices. Those pressures were partially offset by ongoing cost-saving initiatives across the businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 5%. Turning to the outlook. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included an extra week, which contributed $110 million to revenues or about 4% to revenue growth and will impact prior year compares. We continue to face some supply chain and inflationary pressures and advertising conditions remain uncertain. However, it is important to note that the company's exposure to advertising has materially declined as a result of the reshaping of our portfolio, including the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. In fact, advertising revenues represented only 16% of total revenues in the third quarter. Despite the extra week, a difficult prior year comparison and ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, given current spot rates, we expect to see improvements in profitability in the fourth quarter as we continue to implement aggressive cost initiatives.Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April declined 24%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, like the third quarter, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term, and we will continue to balance marketing spend and reinvestment in adjacencies with necessary cost reductions elsewhere.In Subscription Video Services, we continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable to the prior year despite a step-up in sports rights costs in the second half related to annual contractual escalators. At Dow Jones, we saw an improvement in advertising in April, albeit visibility remains limited as the prior year compares will be further impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2022. We expect the rate of investment spending to slow, which should lead to improved profitability in the fourth quarter. We have now fully lapped the OPIS acquisitions in the third quarter and will lap CMA in June. In Book Publishing, April revenue trends were soft, consistent with industry data, but we expect cost pressures to start to moderate and are optimistic about our release slide, which as Robert noted, includes Magnolia Table Volume 3 from Joanna Gaines, and Queen Charlotte, a prequel to Bridgerton from Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes.At News Media, advertising trends remain volatile with limited visibility. We expect total segment cost decline, in part, due to lower incremental costs related to the TalkTV investment, which launched in April 2022, and we hope to see improved profitability for the segment. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.David KarnovskyRobert, following up on your comments about generative AI. I'd be interested to get kind of your expanded view on how you think this tech is going to impact how consumers receive their news and information and what opportunities or risks that opens up for you in terms of your relationship with readers. And then maybe as a follow-on, what use cases do you see for the technology and the generation or repackaging of some of the news content produced?Robert J. ThomsonDavid, a very thoughtful question. We're obviously at an early stage of the evolution of generative AI, it will have a profound impact. And I was recently tech hosting our teams, and in recent months, HarperCollins Japan has been using sophisticated programs to create images for manga stories by transforming a sketch or a photo or just inputting words through a separate generative AI programs. We use an image from our library to create complete manga scenes, obviously saving a lot of time and transforming potentially the character of that business. But it's not only going to have an impact on content, it will clearly have a profound impact on the management of the business, whether customer service or billing or whatever. I mean one contradiction of any business is that the more you customize, the harder and more expensive it is to scale. And that contradiction can be overcome with AI. I think as the well-known management consultant Socrates observed, the secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but building the new.OperatorThe next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.Kane HannanMaybe just the cost out. I'm just interested, I suppose, on some of the commentary there, particularly Dow Jones, and then books was pretty positive on the top line outlook and how things have been improving. Just interested why the cost out target has been upgraded with that backdrop. And I suppose as a follow-on to that, just what the net benefit of the cost-out program was in the first quarter, if we think about all-in with the restructuring charges potentially coming through?Robert J. ThomsonKane, look, obviously, the headcount reduction is about calibration, not celebration, but it's fair to say that the savings will exceed the -- significantly the $136 million that we identified in the last earnings call, and we'll now surpass $160 million. That's attribute to the diligence of our teams undertaking difficult work. And to emphasize that's just one element of the cost cutting that's underway at the company as we severely scrutinize everything from tech spend to travel expenses. So the total savings number next year will obviously exceed that total.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Kane, just to add, our business units, they're quite experienced at identifying areas for improvement, and we can leverage those across the group as we look for cost savings, which is one of the reasons we've been able to drive additional cost savings. We're not going to get into the details about sort of the net off of the cost savings, but we can expect that as we head into fiscal 2024, from Q1, we really would expect to see the majority of those cost savings hit the P&amp;L.OperatorThe next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.Craig Anthony HuberCraig Huber. I had a similar question on the cost. Obviously, you've announced 5% head count reduction 3 months ago. That's roughly about 2% of the total costs. Can you quantify at all what the other cost savings you're talking about is? I mean, a few companies just reduced headcount but don't touch other stuff, and you guys are taking costs out elsewhere. Can you quantify that for us? Is that possible?Susan Lee PanuccioWe haven't quantified it, Craig. But what I can say is cuts across a couple different areas. We're looking at discretionary spend, as you'd expect, office expenses, T&amp;E, we have a look across our print sites, and we're constantly looking for opportunities around our manufacturing plants and what we can do there. We look at our casual cost base with the variable costs. We have a look at marketing costs as well. So it's really a variety of costs that we continue to focus on. As I said, the businesses are pretty good at actually having a look at this now.OperatorThe next question will come from Darren Leung from Macquarie.Darren LeungI just wanted to ask around the high printing costs and supply chain issues in books, please. So I think we had talked about it being a headwind in prior periods. And looking at it, it looks like it's flat versus the prior year. Can you just give us a feel as to what we've achieved or what's changed in the business to sort of maintain that, please?Susan Lee PanuccioActually, I think the comps are up year-on-year because we are still experiencing some of those supply chain pressures. I mean what I would say is freight costs, we're seeing a moderating of that as we're seeing easing of some of the supply chain pressures on shipping costs. But we are seeing enhanced paper costs still coming through, and we're seeing some additional fuel costs that are coming in because of the inflationary pressures. So it was a little bit mixed. We are seeing them moderating, but they have been up.Robert J. ThomsonAnd so Darren, just to supplement Susan. Of course, what has been particularly prevalent over the past year is the change in purchasing, as I said, at Amazon. And now that the reset has been reset, we have more confidence in the profitability of HarperCollins. And no doubt that the current crop of bestsellers will make a positive difference in coming quarters.OperatorOur next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.Alan Steven GouldRobert, Susan, I'm always shocked how well the News Media business continues to hold up. Two things on there. Can you give us a little more detail of what's happening with TalkTV and the plans to turn that profitably? And secondly, just shocked to see print advertising actually doing better than digital advertising this quarter. What is happening there?Robert J. ThomsonWell, Alan, on TalkTV, we've always said it will be a low-cost, high-quality project, and that we'll constantly review progress and technological developments that give us flexibility in delivery and reduced expenses. In the coming months, you should see that incremental costs are falling with a naturally positive impact on our earnings. And I have to say the venture has certainly enabled us to promote products across a plethora of our platforms and enhanced our video capability globally, given that we're able to slice and dice programs in different formats for different time zones. And as you can imagine, increasing our video expertise generally is a core priority for all our businesses.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd then Alan, just on the print side, I mean, look, it has been a pleasant surprise, and we've seen this over the last couple of years as it relates to print advertising. It really just depends on the categories. Down in Australia, they've seen a pickup in travel advertising, which has really helped Dow there as the market has started to open up. They do get some good tailwinds from retail in different quarters as well. So it really is variable each quarter, but it's down to the different category.OperatorWe'll take a follow-up from Craig Huber from Huber Research.Craig Anthony HuberSorry. Sorry about that. Your book revenues held up much better than we thought in the quarter. I mean, given the issues you guys have called out in the past about Amazon and warehouse issues with them and stuff, can you just talk through that? Or do you think that's all behind you now?Robert J. ThomsonCraig, as I mentioned earlier, there clearly has been an adjustment at Amazon. That adjustment, as we understand it, is complete. And so those awkward moments are passed. And now really, it's down to the quality of the frontlist and expanding the impact of our backlist. For example, in the most recent quarter, backlist was 60% of sales. As you know, backlist generally is more profitable for us. And so now we have an opportunity to make the most of our excellent authors and our marketing potential.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Craig, we're also -- I mean, for April, we've just had the results come in, and there has been a little bit of softness just in consumption.

What do you got?SEANA SMITH: All righty, Akiko. We've got two names for you here, News Corp and Getty Images. Let's kick it off with News Corp because we're looking at gains in extended trading of just about 5 and 1/2%. The company beating the Street's estimates on both the top and bottom line. News Corp also saying that its cost reduction measures, which does include a headcount reduction of about 5%, they now expect that to yield about $160 million in annualized savings. We're looking at a pop here of just about 5%.But on a year-over-year basis, yes, those numbers did beat what the Street was looking for. But revenue has declined from a year ago, off just about 1.8%. Also, its news media ad revenue decreasing $11 million, or about 5% from a year ago. Year to date, you're looking at losses of just about 8%.Switching it over to Getty Images, that stock off just about 1 and 1/2% here in extended trading. A mixed report from the company-- EPS did miss. Revenue coming in better than expected. Free cash flow, $16.4 million.But let's take a look at a two-month chart of Getty because you can certainly see the pop in the stock here, up just about 25%. The big reason for that was the fact that the company is under activist investor pressure here from Trillium Capital. Trillium urging the company to explore strategic options, including a sale. We'll hear whether or not we get any more information on that on the earnings call tonight here. But again, stock under pressure in after hours. Trading over the last two months up 25% year to date, looking at gains of just about 12%.]"

We trust that justice and common sense will prevail, and that Evan will soon be released.""THIRD QUARTER RESULTSThe Company reported fiscal 2023 third quarter total revenues of $2.45 billion, a 2% decrease compared to $2.49 billion in the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to a $98 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment due to continued challenging housing market conditions in the U.S. and Australia. The decline was partially offset by higher Dow Jones segment revenues, which includes the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics (""CMA""), and higher revenues at the News Media and Subscription Video Services segments on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Revenues (which excludes the foreign currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures as defined in Note 2) were flat compared to the prior year.Net income for the quarter was $59 million, a 43% decline compared to $104 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Total Segment EBITDA, as discussed below, higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher losses from equity affiliates, partially offset by lower impairment charges.The Company reported third quarter Total Segment EBITDA of $320 million, an 11% decline compared to $358 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above, higher costs at the Dow Jones segment, and a $13 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The results this quarter also include $7 million of costs related to the professional fees incurred by the Special Committee and the Company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust, as well as the fees related to the potential sale of Move. Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) decreased 15%.Net income per share attributable to News Corporation stockholders was $0.09 as compared to $0.14 in the prior year.Adjusted EPS (as defined in Note 3) were $0.09 compared to $0.16 in the prior year.SEGMENT REVIEWFor the three months endedMarch 31,For the nine months endedMarch 31,20232022% Change20232022% Change(in millions)Better/(Worse)(in millions)Better/(Worse)Revenues:Digital Real Estate Services$363$416(13)%$1,170$1,298(10)%Subscription Video Services477494(3)%1,4411,502(4)%Dow Jones5294879%1,6071,43912%Book Publishing515515—%1,5331,678(9)%News Media563580(3)%1,6951,794(6)%Other———%———%Total Revenues$2,447$2,492(2)%$7,446$7,711(3)%Segment EBITDA:Digital Real Estate Services$102$137(26)%$349$453(23)%Subscription Video Services6879(14)%269279(4)%Dow Jones1098824%36132710%Book Publishing6167(9)%151259(42)%News Media3439(13)%111184(40)%Other(54)(52)(4)%(162)(148)(9)%Total Segment EBITDA$320$358(11)%$1,079$1,354(20)%Digital Real Estate ServicesRevenues in the quarter decreased $53 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year, reflecting a $13 million, or 3%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $35 million, or 26%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower revenues, a $5 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and higher costs related to REA India, partially offset by lower costs at Move. Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) decreased 10% and 24%, respectively.In the quarter, revenues at REA Group decreased $24 million, or 10%, to $222 million, driven by a $13 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower Australian residential revenues due to the decline in national listings, most notably in Sydney and Melbourne, and lower financial services revenues due to declines in settlement activity. The decline was partially offset by price increases, increased penetration of Premiere Plus, increased depth penetration in the Australian residential business and higher revenues from REA India. Australian national residential buy listing volumes in the quarter declined 12% compared to the prior year, with listings in Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively.Move’s revenues in the quarter decreased $29 million, or 17%, to $141 million, primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues. Real estate revenues, which represented 79% of total Move revenues, decreased $33 million, or 23%, driven by the continued impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, including higher household interest rates, which has led to lower lead and transaction volumes. Revenues from the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, and the traditional lead generation product decreased due to these factors, partially offset by improved lead optimization. The referral model generated 23% of total Move revenues in the quarter compared to 28% in the prior year. Based on Move’s internal data, average monthly unique users of Realtor.com®’s web and mobile sites for the fiscal third quarter declined 24% year-over-year to 72 million. Lead volume declined 30%.Subscription Video ServicesRevenues of $477 million in the quarter decreased $17 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, due to a $28 million, or 5%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Revenues of $505 million increased 2% compared to the prior year. Higher revenues from Kayo and BINGE, driven by increases in both volume and pricing, were partially offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 26% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter, as compared to 20% in the prior year.As of March 31, 2023, Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were over 4.5 million, a 6% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to the growth in streaming subscribers driven by BINGE and Kayo, partially offset by lower residential broadcast and commercial subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn in the quarter improved to 12.3%, the lowest level since Fiscal 2016, from 14.3% in the prior year.

The decline was primarily due to higher sports programming rights costs, driven mainly by contractual increases across AFL, NRL and Cricket Australia, partially offset by lower marketing spend for Kayo and BINGE and lower transmission costs. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 9%.Dow JonesRevenues in the quarter increased $42 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year, which includes $27 million and $19 million contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted Revenues at the Dow Jones segment were flat compared to the prior year, as the growth in circulation and subscription revenues from continued growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products and digital subscription gains was offset by lower advertising revenues. Digital revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter represented 79% of total revenues compared to 76% in the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues increased $49 million, or 13%, which includes the contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Circulation revenue declined 1%, primarily due to lower print volume and lower revenues from IBD, partially offset by the continued growth in digital-only subscriptions, primarily at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues grew 38%, primarily driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products. Revenues from the Risk &amp; Compliance products grew 16%, which includes a 3% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 69% of circulation revenues for the quarter, compared to 68% in the prior year.During the third quarter, total average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached over 5.1 million, a 6% increase compared to the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products grew 10%. Total subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 5% compared to the prior year, to nearly 3.9 million average subscriptions in the quarter.

Digital advertising accounted for 59% of total advertising revenues in the quarter, compared to 62% in the prior year.Segment EBITDA for the quarter increased $21 million, or 24%, which includes a $17 million combined contribution from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. The growth reflects the higher revenues discussed above and the absence of $15 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of OPIS in the prior year, partially offset by $21 million of higher employee costs due to the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and $6 million of higher marketing costs, partly due to the increase in the number of in-person conferences and events. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 11%.Book PublishingRevenues in the quarter were flat with the prior year, as higher sales in Christian books were offset by the $11 million, or 2%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Key titles in the quarter included The Courage to Be Free by Ron DeSantis, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver and Never, Never by Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher. Adjusted Revenues increased 2%. Digital sales declined 3% compared to the prior year due to lower e-book sales. Digital sales represented 23% of Consumer revenues for the quarter and were in-line with the prior year. Backlist sales represented approximately 60% of total revenues in the quarter.Segment EBITDA for the quarter decreased $6 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year, driven by ongoing supply chain, inventory and inflationary pressures on manufacturing, freight and distribution costs. The decline was partially offset by lower employee costs. These pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 7%.News MediaRevenues in the quarter decreased $17 million, or 3%, as compared to the prior year, driven by a $42 million, or 7%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher circulation and subscription and advertising revenues in constant currency. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK decreased 5% and 4%, respectively, as both were impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK increased 1% and 6%, respectively. Adjusted Revenues for the segment increased 4% compared to the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $11 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $21 million, or 8%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower print volume. The decline was partially offset by cover price increases and digital subscriber growth.Advertising revenues decreased $11 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $15 million, or 7%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower digital advertising at News Corp Australia, and lower print advertising at News UK. The decline was partially offset by growth in digital advertising at News UK and higher print advertising at News Corp Australia.In the quarter, Segment EBITDA decreased $5 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year, driven by lower revenues, as discussed above, and reflects a $4 million, or 10%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The decline was also due to a $14 million negative impact from higher newsprint prices and approximately $13 million of higher costs related to TalkTV and other digital investments, primarily at News Corp Australia. The Segment EBITDA decline was partially offset by cost saving initiatives. Newsprint, production and distribution costs are expected to be higher in fiscal 2023 than the prior year due to supply chain and inflationary pressures, partially offset by the Company’s continued transition to digital products. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 5%.Digital revenues represented 36% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter, compared to 35% in the prior year, and represented 34% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads.

Foxtel’s capital expenditures for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 were $118 million compared to $125 million in the prior year.Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and free cash flow available to News Corporation is defined as free cash flow, less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group.The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation, which adjusts free cash flow to exclude REA Group’s free cash flow and include dividends received from REA Group, provides management and investors with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Company’s unadjusted free cash flow. A limitation of both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is that they do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.COMPARISON OF NON-GAAP TO U.S. GAAP INFORMATIONAdjusted Revenues, Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Segment EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders, Adjusted EPS, constant currency revenues, free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures contained in this earnings release. The Company believes these measures are important tools for investors and analysts to use in assessing the Company’s underlying business performance and to provide for more meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance between periods. These measures also allow investors and analysts to view the Company’s business from the same perspective as Company management. These non-GAAP measures may be different than similar measures used by other companies and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the differences between non-GAAP measures used in this earnings release and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are included in Notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is included above.Conference callNews Corporation’s earnings conference call can be heard live at 5:00 p.m. EDT on May 11, 2023.

Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods. The following tables reconcile net income to Total Segment EBITDA for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:For the three months ended March 31,20232022Change% Change(in millions)Net income$59$104$(45)(43)%Add:Income tax expense3229310%Other, net(14)(13)(1)(8)%Interest expense, net2525——%Equity losses of affiliates1046**Impairment and restructuring charges2537(12)(32)%Depreciation and amortization183172116%Total Segment EBITDA$320$358$(38)(11)%** - Not meaningfulFor the nine months ended March 31,20232022Change% Change(in millions)Net income$219$633$(414)(65)%Add:Income tax expense128199(71)(36)%Other, net10(143)153**Interest expense, net78681015%Equity losses of affiliates431033**Impairment and restructuring charges6582(17)(21)%Depreciation and amortization536505316%Total Segment EBITDA$1,079$1,354$(275)(20)%** - Not meaningfulNOTE 2 – ADJUSTED REVENUES, ADJUSTED TOTAL SEGMENT EBITDA AND ADJUSTED SEGMENT EBITDAThe Company uses revenues, Total Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, fees and costs, net of indemnification, related to the claims and investigations arising out of certain conduct at The News of the World (the ""U.K. Newspaper Matters""), charges for other significant, non-ordinary course legal or regulatory matters (""litigation charges"") and foreign currency fluctuations (""Adjusted Revenues,"" ""Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA"" and ""Adjusted Segment EBITDA,"" respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company’s core business operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period such as the unpredictability and volatility of currency fluctuations. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.The calculation of Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment. Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for amounts determined under GAAP as measures of performance. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company’s historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to investors to assist in their analysis of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors.The following tables reconcile reported revenues and reported Total Segment EBITDA to Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Total Segment

STOCKHOLDERS AND ADJUSTED EPSThe Company uses net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") excluding expenses related to U.K. Newspaper Matters, litigation charges, impairment and restructuring charges and ""Other, net"", net of tax, recognized by the Company or its equity method investees, as well as the settlement of certain pre-Separation tax matters (""adjusted net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders"" and ""adjusted EPS,"" respectively), to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, as well as certain non-operational items. The calculation of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for consolidated net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and net income (loss) per share as determined under GAAP as a measure of performance.

The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as described in Note 2.Constant currency revenues are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for revenues as determined under GAAP as measures of performance. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company’s historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to investors to assist in their analysis of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors.The following tables reconcile reported revenues to constant currency revenues for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023:Q3 Fiscal 2022Q3 Fiscal 2023FX impactQ3 Fiscal 2023 constant currency% Change - reported% Change - constant currency($ in millions)Better/(Worse)Consolidated results:Circulation and subscription$1,099$1,122$(50)$1,1722%7%Advertising418393(19)412(6)%(1)%Consumer497495(11)506—%2%Real estate316272(9)281(14)%(11)%Other162165(9)1742%7%Total revenues$2,492$2,447$(98)$2,545(2)%2%Digital Real Estate Services:Circulation and subscription$3$3$—$3—%—%Advertising3335(1)$366%9%Real estate316272(9)$281(14)%(11)%Other6453(3)$56(17)%(13)%Total Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues$416$363$(13)$376(13)%(10)%REA Group revenues$246$222$(13)$235(10)%(4)%Subscription Video Services:Circulation and subscription$434$419$(25)$444(3)%2%Advertising5149(3)$52(4)%2%Other99—$9—%—%Total Subscription Video Services segment revenues$494$477$(28)$505(3)%2%Q3 Fiscal 2022Q3 Fiscal 2023FX impactQ3 Fiscal 2023 constant currency% Change - reported% Change - constant currency($ in millions)Better/(Worse)Dow Jones:Circulation and subscription$377$426$(4)$43013%14%Advertising10288—$88(14)%(14)%Other815—$1588%88%Total Dow Jones segment revenues$487$529$(4)$5339%9%Book Publishing:Consumer497495(11)$506—%2%Other1820—$2011%11%Total Book Publishing segment revenues$515$515$(11)$526—%2%News Media:Circulation and subscription$285$274$(21)$295(4)%4%Advertising232221(15)$236(5)%2%Other6368(6)$748%17%Total News Media segment revenues$580$563$(42)$605(3)%4%News UKCirculation and subscription$144$135$(14)$149(6)%3%Advertising7272(6)$78—%8%Other2828(3)$31—%11%Total News UK revenues$244$235$(23)$258(4)%6%News Corp AustraliaCirculation and subscription$119$112$(7)$119(6)%—%Advertising10599(6)$105(6)%—%Other3131(2)$33—%6%Total News Corp Australia revenues$255$242$(15)$257(5)%1%Q3 YTD Fiscal 2022Q3 YTD Fiscal 2023FX impactQ3 YTD Fiscal 2023 constant currency% Change - reported% Change - constant currency($ in millions)Better/(Worse)Consolidated results:Circulation and subscription$3,248$3,318$(207)$3,5252%9%Advertising1,3421,263(80)1,343(6)%—%Consumer1,6151,474(55)1,529(9)%(5)%Real estate988896(43)939(9)%(5)%Other518495(37)532(4)%3%Total revenues$7,711$7,446$(422)$7,868(3)%2%Digital Real Estate Services:Circulation and subscription$9$9$—$9—%—%Advertising99103(3)$1064%7%Real estate988896(43)$939(9)%(5)%Other202162(13)$175(20)%(13)%Total Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues$1,298$1,170$(59)$1,229(10)%(5)%REA Group revenues$779$714$(59)$773(8)%(1)%Subscription Video Services:Circulation and subscription$1,307$1,249$(104)$1,353(4)%4%Advertising165160(13)$173(3)%5%Other3032(3)$357%17%Total Subscription Video Services segment revenues$1,502$1,441$(120)$1,561(4)%4%Dow Jones:Circulation and subscription$1,082$1,257$(19)$1,27616%18%Advertising333313—$313(6)%(6)%Other2437—$3754%54%Total Dow Jones segment revenues$1,439$1,607$(19)$1,62612%13%Book Publishing:Consumer1,6151,474(55)$1,529(9)%(5)%Other6359—$59(6)%(6)%Total Book Publishing segment revenues$1,678$1,533$(55)$1,588(9)%(5)%Q3 YTD Fiscal 2022Q3 YTD Fiscal 2023FX impactQ3 YTD Fiscal 2023 constant currency% Change - reported% Change - constant currency($ in millions)Better/(Worse)News Media:Circulation and subscription$850$803$(84)$887(6)%4%Advertising745687(64)$751(8)%1%Other199205(21)$2263%14%Total News Media segment revenues$1,794$1,695$(169)$1,864(6)%4%News UKCirculation and subscription$428$398$(57)$455(7)%6%Advertising235216(25)$241(8)%3%Other8880(11)$91(9)%3%Total News UK revenues$751$694$(93)$787(8)%5%News Corp AustraliaCirculation and subscription$354$331$(27)$358(6)%1%Advertising337316(26)$342(6)%1%Other105102(8)$110(3)%5%Total News Corp Australia revenues$796$749$(61)$810(6)%2%View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230511005750/en/ContactsInvestor Relations Michael Florin212-416-3363mflorin@newscorp.comLeslie Kim212-416-4529lkim@newscorp.comCorporate Communications Jim Kennedy212-416-4064jkennedy@newscorp.com]"

Derrickson; President, CEO &amp; Director; BSQUARE CorporationPresentationOperatorGreetings, and welcome to the Bsquare Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ralph C. Derrickson, the President and CEO. Thank you, and you may proceed, sir.Ralph C. DerricksonThank you. Good afternoon, investors, and welcome to the Q1 2023 Bsquare Quarterly Earnings Call. Joining me today is Cheryl Wynne, Bsquare's Chief Financial Officer. Before we go any further, we'd like to remind you the call is being webcast and a recording of the call and the text of our prepared remarks will be available on the Bsquare website.During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.In our commentary, we may also refer to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the cautionary text regarding forward-looking statements contained in Bsquare's earnings release issued today and on our website at www.bsquare.com under Investors.All per share amounts discussed today are fully diluted numbers where applicable. We will be taking questions after our prepared remarks. For anyone who would like to arrange a follow-up conversation with us, please send an e-mail to investorrelations@bsquare.com. This mailbox is monitored regularly and you will get a response within 1 business day.Okay. With that out of the way, let's turn our attention to the Q1 2023 results. We are pleased with the significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in our loss from operations. As we've shared in recent calls, running the business as efficiently as possible is a priority for us, and it was gratifying to see it play out in our numbers in the first quarter.Let's start by having Cheryl take us through the Q1 results in detail, and I'll continue my remarks after that. Cheryl, over to you.Story continuesCheryl WynneThank you, Ralph, and good afternoon, investors. Today, I'll be providing an overview of our financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Most of my comparisons will be to the fourth quarter of 2022. I'll let you know when I'm comparing to other periods. I'll start with a review of our income statement and then move to a discussion of our balance sheet.Total revenue for the first quarter was approximately $8.1 million, which was an increase of $200,000 or 2% from the fourth quarter. The Partner Solutions segment drove the increase as revenue from the Edge to Cloud segment was flat quarter-over-quarter. The favorable revenue results drove a total increase in gross profit of $49,000.Let's take a look at our revenue and gross profit results at a segment level, starting first with Partner Solutions. Partner Solutions revenue increased $190,000 or 3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was largely due to 1 additional shipping day in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.Daily average sales were flat quarter-over-quarter. Commensurate with the revenue increase, Partner Solutions gross profit increased $34,000. Gross margin rate improved 10 basis points driven by customer and product mix.In the Edge to Cloud segment, revenue was $874,000, which was in line with the fourth quarter. Some favorability in cost of revenue drove a 180 basis point improvement in gross margin rate, resulting in a small increase in the segment's gross profit.Turning our attention now to expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.7 million, which was a $1 million decrease from the fourth quarter. Of this improvement, $200,000 was due to restructuring charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter and did not recur in the first quarter. The rest of the quarter-over-quarter improvement or $800,000 was driven by decreases in our selling, general and administrative or SG&amp;A costs.Marketing expenses were the most notable driver of the decrease. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred professional fees related to the completion of a significant overhaul and upgrade of our website. Also marketing related, in the first quarter, we recognized a larger amount of cooperative rebate dollars from Microsoft as compared to the fourth quarter.The other driver of the quarter-over-quarter decrease in SG&amp;A costs was labor and benefits due in part to the reduction in force action that was executed in December 2022. Research and development expenses were up very slightly quarter-over-quarter.As you may recall, during the third quarter of 2022, we implemented an investment strategy intended to take advantage of rising interest rates while maintaining a focus on liquidity. Our Q1 results include $360,000 of interest income. We intend to continue investing our cash reserves for the foreseeable future until there is an alternative use of the reserves that will produce a higher return for our shareholders.We are utilizing a laddered investment strategy, staggering maturity dates so that the portions of our portfolio mature at regular intervals. This strategy ensures that our liquidity is readily accessible and available to fund strategic growth investments.Overall, loss from operations for the quarter was $448,000 compared to the fourth quarter loss from operations of $1.5 million. This $1 million improvement was primarily driven by the decrease in operating expenses discussed earlier.Net loss for the quarter was $71,000, less than $0.01 per diluted share, which was a significant improvement over the fourth quarter net loss of $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share.Turning now to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $34 million on March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.7 million compared to December 31, 2022. $400,000 of the cash decrease was driven by share repurchases, $500,000 of the cash decrease was due to annual prepaid items including corporate insurance, and the balance of the change or $800,000 was primarily timing related stemming from changes in our working capital account balances.As a reminder, we announced a plan to repurchase up to $5 million worth of our common stock. The plan is intended to return value to our shareholders without compromising our ability to pursue organic growth or strategic alternatives. During the first quarter of 2023, the company repurchased approximately 304,000 shares for $400,000. In total, we have repurchased approximately 483,000 shares for $600,000.This concludes my summary of our first quarter results, and I'll turn it back to Ralph now.Ralph C. DerricksonThank you, Cheryl. While it was great to see Partner Solutions revenue up slightly quarter-over-quarter, we have seen a long-term trend of revenue decline that worsened with the onset of COVID. We anticipate that this trend will continue.Unlike other Microsoft software distributors who also sell hardware, our Partner Solutions revenue is very much tied to the success of Microsoft's Windows IoT operating system in the embedded market and their ability to effectively compete with Linux and Android. Microsoft software distributors who also sell hardware aren't as concerned with which operating system their customer chooses, nor are they as concerned about preserving software margin.Our primary competitive advantage among distributors is our technical expertise and superior business services. We will continue to use these qualities as a differentiator, especially with new customers who need our help configuring the Windows IoT operating systems for new products. However, we anticipate the year-over-year Partner Solutions revenue decline will continue. Our immediate objective is to maximize the segment by preserving margins and attempting to minimize revenue decay.The Edge to Cloud segment continues to be a stable source of revenue and contribution margin for us. Bulk of the business derives from a handful of large customers who have long-term contracts with us that generate revenue from a mix of software licensing and professional services. Our SquareOne product was informed by these customers, and we hope in the future to incorporate components of SquareOne into these customers' solution when they're up for renewal or when they are ready to upgrade their systems.Turning to SquareOne. The shift in positioning to a solution accelerant that we discussed at our last earnings call has broadened the scope of our conversations allowing us to improve engagement with potential customers and partners. It's important to note that the shift in positioning isn't a shift in business model. The model assumes that revenue will be a mix of nonrecurring or NRE software services, software licensing and potentially, operations services. We anticipate the gross margin mix of the SquareOne model will settle above 50%.SquareOne offers a very well-defined set of extensible device management software components that allow us to tailor SquareOne to the unique needs of customers without having to create a new product for each one. Leading with this capability has been the difference in engagement and response from potential customers.Turning now to the business more broadly. With the headcount reductions we made in December of 2022 and a revenue plan that considers the realities I covered earlier, we are running the company as efficiently as possible. With that as a backdrop, the Board and leadership team have been evaluating all options for creating shareholder value.There have been a number of questions recently from shareholders about the options we are contemplating. So let me expand on that to the extent that I can now.Partner Solutions line of business generates cash and could be a valuable complement to the right organization. Our Edge to Cloud and SquareOne lines together could be the basis for a business focused solely on device operations.We could use our cash to make complementary acquisitions that could accelerate revenue growth. We could make a special dividend -- cash dividend to shareholders, but that decision, including the timing and the amount is a function of the other options we're considering. I don't have anything specific to share today, but I wanted shareholders to know the breadth and extent of the options under consideration.What we are not going to do is to continue to dissipate cash to fund the status quo. None of us came here just to collect a paycheck. We are aggressively pursuing options for organic and inorganic growth. And if we can't drive growth, we will seek to return value to shareholders in other ways.Again, I don't have a specific time line, but I expect it is more likely measured in months and quarters than in years. In the meantime, we will continue to operate the business as efficiently as possible like we did in the first quarter as evidenced by our $1 million improvement in loss from operations.Before we take questions, there are a couple of administrative matters to discuss. As you may know, we filed our definitive proxy earlier this month and the Annual Shareholder Meeting will take place at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on June 15. Of the items to be voted on there, there are 2 that I would like to call out: first, we are asking for approval of our proposal to declassify the Board of Directors.Declassification requires a change to our articles of incorporation. So we are asking shareholders to approve the restated articles of incorporation, which combined into a single document all revisions previously approved by shareholders and the concurrent proposed change to declassify the Board.Declassification is the only substantive change to the articles we are asking for approval. The declassification of directors, if approved, will start next year and will continue with each class over the next 3 years.The second item I'd like to highlight is the vote on our slate of Class 1 directors that includes the reelection of Bob Chamberlain, who also serves as Audit Committee Chair; and the election of Richard Karp, a new Director. If passed, Richard will take our director count to 6. Other matters to be voted on are well covered in the proxy, so I won't take time here.With that, operator, please open the line for questions. While people are signaling to ask questions, please remember that if you'd like to arrange a follow-up conversation, send an e-mail to investorrelations@bsquare.com.Operator(Operator Instructions) Mr. Derrickson, it seems like there are no questions. If it's okay with you, could I hand over to you perhaps for closing remarks, though.Ralph C. DerricksonThank you, operator, and thank you, investors. I really appreciate your time and participating in our call today. We participate in your interest, and we look forward to seeing you at the Annual Shareholders Meeting in June. Good afternoon.OperatorThank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

WBA is gaining from persistent partnership growth and a strong focus on strategic execution. The upbeat 2023 guidance looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 26.8% compared with a 28.8% fall of the industry and a 4.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $28.92 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 2.48% on average. However, the company’s long-term projected growth rate of 3% remains behind the industry’s growth projection of 5.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayNew Alliances Look Strategic: The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial. The Prothena partnership follows Walgreens’ vision to work with all the stakeholders to develop and evaluate effective therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.The same month, the U.S. Healthcare segment of Walgreens and VillageMD announced the expansion of Village Medical at Walgreens into Colorado, with three new primary care practices, two in Fort Collins and a third in Longmont. Village MD’s physicians and Walgreens’ pharmacy team members work together to provide patients with cost-effective, expert care for chronic conditions and general illnesses and injuries.Long-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Per the January update, Walgreens Boots noted that U.S. Healthcare targets raised with Summit Health announcement on Nov 7, 2022, including fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5 billion to $16.0 billion, up from $11.0 billion to $12.0 billion previously and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the segment by the end of fiscal year 2023.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking beyond 2023, the company increased clarity into its long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond.Upbeat Guidance: The company projects adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45-$4.65. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.57.The company expects revenues to be $137.5 billion. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $134.6 billion.DownsidesPressure on Margin Continues: In the past few years, the slowdown in the generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margins on a significant level.Competitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds from increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been constant at $4.50.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $136.18 billion, suggesting a 2.6% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Under U.S. law, airline workers can't legally strike unless federal mediators decide that further negotiations are pointless. Even then, the president and Congress can block a strike.Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said the union will petition mediators for permission to strike but will follow the process spelled out in the law.The union and the Dallas-based airline have been negotiating over a new contract for more than three years.]"

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

This effort is separate from the Fed’s annual bank stress tests.Six of the largest US banks — Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) — are being asked to assess the impact of everything from hurricanes and wildfires to heatwaves and higher average temperatures on residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios over the next year. The Fed calls these ""physical risk scenarios.""Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve member Chris Waller, speaks during a conversations with leaders from organizations that include nonprofits, small businesses, manufacturing, supply chain management, the hospitality industry, and the housing and education sectors at the Federal Reserve building, Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed is also asking banks to evaluate the impact of stresses from the transitioning to a lower carbon economy on corporate and commercial real estate loan portfolios over a 10-year horizon.Waller said Thursday that he does think it’s important to continue doing academic research regarding the role that climate plays in economic outcomes. But he said he doesn't believe risks posed by climate change merit special treatment from the Fed.Falling property values tied to physical climate risks like hurricanes and fires could result in losses for banks, he said, but ""there is a growing body of literature that suggests economic agents are already adjusting behavior to account for risks associated with climate change.""Story continuesWaller said the Fed already tests for severe declines in real estate values in its annual stress tests.In last year's stress test, which envisioned a drop of more than 25% in real estate values, the largest banks were able to absorb nearly $100 billion in losses on loans collateralized by real estate, in addition to another half a trillion dollars of losses on other positions, says Waller.“Based on what I've seen so far, I believe that placing an outsized focus on climate-related risks is not needed, and the Federal Reserve should focus on more near-term and material risks in keeping with our mandate.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Think mobile banking stocks, payment apps and digital money transfers.Nearly half of Americans said they had used a mobile wallet in the past three months, according to a recent survey by J.D. Power. As consumers migrate more and more of their lives online, the fintech revolution rages on. Even traditional banks that have networks of retail branches are moving more of their services into the digital sphere, enabling customers to bank, manage and apply for loans, and make payments using their smartphone or with the click of a mouse.Fintech stocks have struggled over the past two years, taking a beating in the recent bear market. The names below represent the top three mobile banking companies that could deliver outsized gains in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSQBlock$59.25GPNGlobal Payments$104.78SOFISoFi Technologies$5.16Block (SQ)Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comFintech company Block (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Square, has been battered and bruised, losing three-quarters of its value over the past two years. In addition to investors fleeing fintech stocks in 2022 and the massive sell-off in cryptocurrencies (which Block owns a lot of), the company was hit with a negative report from Hindenburg Research. The notorious short seller accused Block of taking a “‘Wild West’ approach to compliance” and facilitating “criminal activity and fraud” on its platform. Block denied the allegations, but the report sent SQ stock plunging 15% in a single trading day.Down 38% over the past 12 months, SQ is up about 15% from its 52-week low, made in early November. Investors may want to consider taking a position here, as there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic about Block and its role in the fintech space.The company’s Cash App mobile payment service remains extremely popular, particularly among small-business owners and the self-employed. The company is also pushing further into crypto with a new Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining strategy that comes as the price of BTC skyrockets this year.Story continuesGlobal Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) is a fintech company that has been around in one form or another since 1967 and provides payment technology and services to both merchants and consumers. While shares are down 48% over the past two years, they have rallied 14% since hitting a 52-week low in late 2022.Recently, GPN stock snagged an upgrade from analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs, which raised their rating on the fintech company to “buy” and gave shares a $127 price target. This implies upside of 21% from current levels.On May 1, the company delivered a first-quarter earnings beat and announced a quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share, giving shares a yield of 1%. In a surprise move, Global Payments also said longtime Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jeff Sloan is stepping down after nearly a decade at the helm. He will be replaced on June 1 by current Chief Operating Officer (COO) Cameron Bready.While the stock sold off nearly 9% on the news, it has regained some ground. Of the 35 analysts who cover GPN, 29 rate it “overweight” or “buy.” Their median price target of $135 is 29% above where shares currently trade.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.Source: Michael Vi / ShutterstockSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI), which specializes in bank transactions and arranging student and vehicle loans through its mobile app, has seen its share price collapse 69% over the past two years. A big part of the problem has been the moratorium placed on student loan repayments during the pandemic, followed by the student loan forgiveness program pursued by the Biden administration.Another issue has been the fact that SoFi Technologies remains unprofitable. The company did just report earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Yet, the stock fell as investors seemingly took issue with the forward guidance provided by the company.Despite its issues, there are signs that the worst might now be over for SOFI stock. Student loan payments are likely to resume by the end of August, and management expects to reach profitability by the end of 2023. Shares are up 12% year to date despite the post-earnings sell-off.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

85,2018c2e8-ffec-3c42-82b1-426b38c19b7d,AIG,2023-05-12,Can American International Group (AIG) Climb 28.91% to Reach the Level Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-aig-climb-135501072.html,1683813301,STORY,"['AIG', 'TGT']","[American International Group (AIG) closed the last trading session at $52.61, gaining 2.5% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $67.82 indicates a 28.9% upside potential.The average comprises 11 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $55 to a high of $83, with a standard deviation of $7.74. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 4.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 57.8% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for AIG, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for AIGHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AIGThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, four estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 4.9%.Moreover, AIG currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AIG could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is American International Group (AIG). AIG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.05. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.63. AIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.69 and as low as 7.26, with a median of 9.29, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that AIG has a P/B ratio of 0.93. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.59. AIG's P/B has been as high as 1.17 and as low as 0.68, with a median of 0.93, over the past year.Finally, investors should note that AIG has a P/CF ratio of 3.63. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.41. AIG's P/CF has been as high as 3.67 and as low as 1.96, with a median of 2.59, all within the past year.Story continuesAllianz (ALIZY) may be another strong Insurance - Multi line stock to add to your shortlist. ALIZY is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Shares of Allianz are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8.99 and a PEG ratio of 2.50 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 8.63 and 0.80, respectively.ALIZY's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.20 and as low as 7.04, with a median of 8.88. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 3.68, as low as 1.96, with a median of 2.46.Furthermore, Allianz holds a P/B ratio of 1.64 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.59. ALIZY's P/B has been as high as 1.73, as low as 0.77, with a median of 1.21 over the past 12 months.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that American International Group and Allianz are likely being undervalued right now.

If you wish to see the top ones, feel free to head straight to the 5 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023. Television has merged seamlessly into contemporary culture, bringing information and pleasure to viewers all around the world. When a movie or television show shoots on location, it creates jobs, generates income, and spurs the creation of related infrastructure, giving the local economy a quick boost. Motion Picture Association says that the sector provides $21 billion in annual payments to more than 260,000 companies in cities and small towns across the nation, and the sector is made up of more than 122,000 companies, 92 percent of which have fewer than 10 employees. When a movie shoots on location, the local economy can receive a daily boost of up to $250,000. Popular films and television shows can occasionally help the tourism industry. For instance, 20th Century Fox's blockbuster television series This Is Us, streamed on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Prime Video, contributed more than $61.5 million to the Californian economy, while Marvel's Black Panther employed more than 3,100 local Georgians and paid them more than $26.5 million in compensation. The Post and The Greatest Showman, two Oscar-nominated films, helped New York's local economy by more than $108 million.Viewership isn't near the levels it used to be due to the proliferation of TV shows and other forms of entertainment. With the introduction of streaming services, the business has quickly changed to accommodate this circumstance and has been given new life. The streaming age was started by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), but other companies quickly realized their potential and entered the market, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Amazon Prime, HBO with HBO Max, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Disney+ by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Story continuesThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns led to a surge in the number of people turning to streaming platforms for their television entertainment. Rather than watching one episode per week, people started ""binge-watching"" entire seasons in one sitting. As a result, streaming companies have seen exponential growth over the past decade, with millions of new viewers added each year. The pandemic provided an additional boost to this trend in 2020.Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had a record-breaking 37 million new customers in 2020, while The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney+ crossed the 100 million subscriber mark in just 16 months. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been able to generate total revenue of $23.51 billion as of 2022 while Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) generated $33.81 billion in the same year. Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), on the other hand, generated $514 billion in revenue in 2022, leaving behind both The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). However, in 2022 more than $300 billion in market value was lost as a result of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s announcement that its subscriber base had decreased, which destroyed its shares and other streaming companies' values. Each streaming service has experienced slower growth rates due to intense rivalry brought on by a large number of formidable rivals, and the future of the Tv show industry will rely on how streaming companies fare.  The Impact Of Covid On The Entertainment IndustryThe global market for theater, home entertainment, and mobile entertainment reached $80.8 billion in 2020, an 18% fall from the previous year and the lowest since 2016. The box office plummeted from $42.3 billion in 2019 to $12 billion in 2020, which was the most significant decline. Compared to 2019, when it made up 43% of all entertainment spending worldwide, live theater only made up just 15% of that total. The 15 most-watched TV shows of 2023 are a testament to the industry's ability to adapt and overcome challenges, providing audiences with engaging and exciting content that they can't get enough of. As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, the TV show industry is poised to continue its growth, creating new and exciting shows that audiences will love. 15 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023mollie-sivaram-yubCnXAA3H8-unsplashOur Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the 15 most-watched TV shows of 2023 based on their total number of hours viewed, in ascending order.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Pays A US$2.13 Dividend In Just Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-pays-100832271.html,1683886112,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Amgen investors that purchase the stock on or after the 17th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$2.13 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$8.52 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Amgen has a trailing yield of approximately 3.7% on its current stock price of $232.29. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Amgen Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Amgen paid out more than half (54%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 56% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Amgen's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Amgen has grown its earnings rapidly, up 40% a year for the past five years. The current payout ratio suggests a good balance between rewarding shareholders with dividends, and reinvesting in growth. With a reasonable payout ratio, profits being reinvested, and some earnings growth, Amgen could have strong prospects for future increases to the dividend.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Amgen has increased its dividend at approximately 19% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineHas Amgen got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However, we'd also note that Amgen is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Amgen and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The company will also move its corporate base to the United Kingdom, but will maintain the South African office.""There are strategic reasons why we did this. By far the largest pool of gold capital is in the U.S and it was clear that a secondary listing incorporating South Africa was restricting access to that pool of capital,"" CEO Alberto Calderon told Reuters in an interview.He added that two-thirds of AngloGold stock volumes were already being traded in New York, where the company has listed depository receipts.Calderon said rating agencies linked AngloGold's credit rating to that of South Africa, which is struggling with severe power cuts that are souring investor sentiment in Africa's most industrialised economy.""We have outgrown South Africa,"" Calderon said, adding that a primary listing in the United States was aligned to its development of four greenfield projects in Nevada, which will take AngloGold's annual output close to 3 million ounces.The plan to move AngloGold's primary listing will be put to a shareholders' vote and requires at least 75% support from investors, Calderon said on a conference call.Story continuesHe again ruled out AngloGold pursuing M&amp;A deals, saying most gold mergers in the recent past have not created value.""It's not impossible, it's just about really trying to understand what are the synergies and how you can bring value to shareholders. What you cannot get carried (away) about is ... thinking that larger is better,"" he said.Calderon said Newmont Corporation's $20 billion bid to acquire Australia's Newcrest Mining was likely to succeed.""I think the Newmont-Newcrest deal is interesting. It will go through, Newmont has to do it. Sustaining a 6 million ounce operation is extraordinarily difficult. I think this will help them do so,"" he said.

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Edison International is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while PSEG has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that EIX has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.EIX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.67, while PEG has a forward P/E of 18.64. We also note that EIX has a PEG ratio of 4.02. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PEG currently has a PEG ratio of 4.30.Another notable valuation metric for EIX is its P/B ratio of 1.82. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PEG has a P/B of 2.17.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EIX's Value grade of B and PEG's Value grade of C.Story continuesEIX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now.Value stocks were clear winners in 2022. As inflation spiked and the Federal Reserve started to boost interest rates, investors fled risky stocks with huge valuations and favored cheap value stocks with realistic multiples. Come 2023, the economic realities that caused a panic in the market remain intact. That’s why major analysts are still recommending piling into value playsAccording to Wall Street Journal, investment firm GMO expects growth stocks to fall further while the firm believes value stocks remain discounted.The report added that about 21% of GMO’s $4.3 billion portfolio was invested in hedge funds seeking to profit from the fall in growth stocks.Tech stocks jumped to new highs recently on the back of optimism that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree is nearing its end. Some analysts believe the market is incorporating the possibility of rate cuts. Prudent investors and analysts are rejecting this optimism and warning that the latest rally in stocks might not last.In February, Goldman Sachs analyst’s analyst Lisa Shalett issued a similar warning:""We remain cautious about the direction of the equities market this year, as these other assets do not confirm the optimistic outlook implied by stocks’ performance. Equity investors are sending prices and valuation multiples higher, with little consideration for broader implications. The likely impacts of tightening monetary policy, corporate earnings vulnerability and uncertainty around the path of inflation are additional reasons for prudence.""In January 2023, Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer gave a bullish outlook for value stocks and said that tech valuations were inflated despite massive declines in share prices, According to the analyst,“As big cap technology sees further margin pressure, commodity prices rise and real interest rates remain higher, we think this trend has further to go.”Story continues""Priced for Perfection""Similarly, Bob Doll, Crossmark Global Investments CIO, recently said in a program on CNBC that the market is priced for “perfection.” The analyst said that economic indicators “haunt” him as he believes the possibility of a soft landing is thin. Doll said last year’s market decline was mostly due to “valuation compression” while this year’s declines will be because of “earnings problems” and “recession.” Answering a question about the possible options for investors in this environment, Doll recommended diversification and said he’s underweight tech. He thinks many tech stocks have been “lagging and struggling.” Doll recommended investors to own value stocks that are not just cheap but has some “current momentum.”Value has “returned with a vengeance,” to quote a JPMorgan’s report, which said that while growth stocks have outperformed value stocks for a long time in the past, the future outlook for value plays look strong. Here’s what the report said:“Value’s potential for future returns remains great. Valuation spreads between Value and Growth are still extreme, and higher than those at the peak of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) bubble. The proportion of equity assets invested with a Value investment style is also very low, meaning flows could provide a significant tailwind.”In this backdrop, it’s a good idea to take a look at stocks that have attractive value multiples, strong profits and  fundamentals.Most Profitable Value Stocks NowOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used a stock screener to find stocks with PE ratios of less than 15 as of April 27 and positive revenue growth. From this list, we picked stocks that have the highest net income (TTM) and the highest number of hedge fund investors. We gauged hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Most Profitable Value Stocks Now16. OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) ranks 16th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now. In February OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) posted full-year 2022 results. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $3.32, easily beating estimates. Revenue in the period totaled $3.37 billion, beating estimates by $2.31 billion. OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) is a high-yield dividend stock, with an over 4% yield.17 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds were long OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.15. Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) ranks 15th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now.

Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) in March declared a quarterly dividend of CAD 1.32 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. The forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.81%.14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21French energy giant TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) is one of the most profitable value plays. During the first quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)’s adjusted EPS came in at $2.61, in line with estimates. Over the past 12 months, the company’s net income stands at over $20.5 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE).ClearBridge International Value Strategy made the following comment about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection in the energy sector was also a strong driver of returns, benefiting from an improving global macro outlook. Prospects for a milder recession, increased demand from China reopening from its COVID-19 restrictions, and the recognition that the market hasn’t discounted oil company valuations based on commodity prices all served to benefit energy company stock prices. Holdings such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), a leading French oil, and natural gas company, was a recipient of these macro tailwinds. We are constructive on the long-term prospects of the energy sector, with it being the second largest relative overweight in the portfolio. We believe that as the market becomes more comfortable with the industry’s intermediate earnings and capital discipline from producers, our high-quality companies in the sector should continue to perform.”13. AGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Agriculture machinery company AGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO) ranks 13th in our list of the most profitable value stocks.During the fourth quarter, AGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO)’s EPS came in at $4.47, beating estimates by $0.58.

(NYSE:NRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39With a PE ratio of 6.4 and a dividend yield of over 4%, NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) is a notable value stock to buy today.As of the end of the last quarter of 2022, 39 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in NRG Energy, Inc.

Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $266 million stake in the company.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.”11. WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:WCC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Raymond James recently gave a Strong Buy rating for WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:WCC). The firm said WESCO International, Inc.

Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) posted its Q4 results back in February. Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK)’s adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.59, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter jumped 20.1% year over year to reach $2.39 billion, beating estimates by $70 million.

The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) was Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management which owns a $179 million stake in the company.9. The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Chemicals and fertilizer company The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) ranks 9th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now. In February The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.74, missing estimates by $0.46. Revenue in the quarter jumped about 16.7% year over year to $4.48 billion, beating estimates by $260 million.In February The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was payable on March 30.White Brook Capital made the following comment about The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS): Despite favorable midterm fertilizer dynamics, Mosaic (MOS) performed worse than expected during the quarter. Significantly, the Company began to rally in the last days of the quarter after it preannounced production at the low end of the guidance for the first quarter when market fears were for an even worse outcome.  Given March weather, particularly in the northern United States, where a significant snow pack continued to cover farmland (as of the first days of April), I expect their 1stquarter earnings call will speak to significant second-quarter demand, particularly as the weather was more favorable for fertilizer usage in early April. Prices during the second week of April for fertilizers broadly also have begun to lessen their decline despite a continued rapid decline in other feedstock commodities.The stock has been driven by concern about destroyed 2023 demand that I believe, given the state of the world’s depleted fields, issues that demand can no longer be destroyed, only delayed, and even that may not be necessary given the rapid improvement of the US’s northern grain basket and the solid fundamentals in Brazil.  The Company continues to trade for a very cheap valuation even though it generates strong free cash flow, returns that cash flow to shareholders, and is under levered. We continue to hold our position.”8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Defense giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the most notable value stocks right now. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) keeps winning major contracts from the US government for several defense and aerospace activities. It was recently awarded a $158.13 million definitized contract action for Global Hawk (RQ-4) aircraft sustainment.Morgan Stanley added Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its 30 for 2025 stock picks list.LRT Capital made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its October investor letter:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7. United Rentals, Inc.

(NYSE:URI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) rents equipment primarily to construction and industrial companies, as well to as manufacturers, utilities, homeowners, municipalities, and other government entities. The company has benefitted from the continued tightness throughout the machinery sector, as original equipment manufacturers struggle to meet demand due to ongoing supply chain constraints. Activity within most of its major customer verticals remains strong, and the company sees itself as well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends such as the reshoring of global supply chains and increased infrastructure investment.”6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Oil giant Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) received bullish comments from Scotiabank's Paul Cheng recently.

Let’s be real: Biden doesn’t have the greatest approval rating. And he’s old – astonishingly old. Nevertheless, he does have a solid chance of winning the White House again. And that bodes well for the blue-collar sector because of Biden and construction industry dynamics.Obviously, Biden initially ran on the campaign promise to build back better. And he helped make good on that promise via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. With a second term, Biden may bring some predictability to the political order. Further, reports about the construction industry analysis in 2023 point toward the pursuit of growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. There’s a better chance of that happening if Biden wins.Still, how can anyone be so confident about his reelection? As The Guardian pointed out, the Republicans are internally divided. You have small-government Republicans (remember those guys?), Trump hardliners and the “Fringe” (it’s better I don’t explain). For the Democrats, you only have President Biden and “Dark Brandon.” It’s just a more cogent framework. Here are the top construction companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMLMMartin Marietta Materials$397.66MASMasco$53.45VMCVulcan Materials$193.57CATCaterpillar$215.09DEDeere$381.09URIUnited Rentals$342.05KELYAKelly Services$16.24Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) is a supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, with operations spanning 26 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. Notably, Martin Marietta supplies resources for the construction of roads, sidewalks, and foundations. Presently, it features a market capitalization of $24.65 billion. Since the start of the year, MLM gained an impressive 15%, making it one of the best construction stocks to buy now.Story continuesOn the financials, Martin Marietta benefits from solid operational statistics. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.3%, above 68.87% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 12.4%, above 64.09% of sector rivals. On the bottom line, the company posts a trailing-year net margin of 14.07%, outflanking 82.64% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg MLM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $418.50, implying almost 8% upside potential.Masco (MAS)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAn American manufacturer of products for the home improvement and new home construction markets, Masco (NYSE:MAS) is a bit of a risk when compared to other top construction companies to invest in. Largely, MAS depends on sentiment for renovation and real estate acquisition. That’s questionable given rising layoffs and interest rates. Nevertheless, for contrarians, MAS could rank among the best construction stocks to buy now.Indeed, the market carries optimism, with shares bouncing over 11% since the Jan. opener. Operationally, Masco enjoys encouraging stats. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 17.1%, ranked above 84.26% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period lands at 13.4%, above 67.44%. On the bottom line, Masco prints an excellent trailing-year net margin of 9.67%, beating out 82.91% of the competition. As with Martin Marietta, Masco benefits from consistent profitability.Lastly, covering analysts peg MAS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $57.92, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Vulcan Materials (VMC)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHailing from Birmingham, Alabama, Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates— primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel — and a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, according to its website. Because of the Biden and construction industry relationship, VMC popped up 8% since the beginning of this year.Investors may look forward to additional gains as VMC ranks among the best construction stocks to buy now. Primarily, Vulcan enjoys strong sales performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above 80.44% of its rivals. On the bottom line, Vulcan features an operating margin and net margin of 13.79% and 7.87%, respectively. Both stats rank above at least 65% of sector peers.To close out, analysts peg VMC as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 10 buys, two holds and zero sells. Overall, the experts’ average price target is $209, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Caterpillar (CAT)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA world-famous construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is no stranger to lists targeting the best construction stocks to buy now. However, it’s interesting at this juncture because of the Biden and construction industry dynamics. In the runup to the 2016 presidential election, former President Donald Trump often praised Caterpillar. However, CAT represents a contrarian play, with shares down 12% since the January opener.To be fair, many of its fiscal stats sit as rather ho-hum: not bad, not great. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 5.7%, better than 54% of its peers. That’s nice but nothing earth-shattering. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the aforementioned period is 9.2%, better than 50.43% of sector players. Again, nothing remarkable.However, Caterpillar offers business predictability. Its operating margin and net margin ping at 15.73% and 11.53%, ranking better than at least 87% of other construction stocks. Currently, analysts peg CAT as a hold. On average, the experts anticipate shares hitting $239.07, implying growth potential of almost 14%.Deere (DE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Specializing in the manufacture of agricultural machinery, Deere (NYSE:DE) is a key player in heavy equipment, forestry machinery, diesel engines, drivetrains used in heavy equipment, and lawn care equipment. Given the Democrats’ holistic view of infrastructure, the need to boost food-related supply chains should undergird this special category of the best construction stocks to buy now. Since the start of the year, DE lost 12% of its equity value.However, such red ink seems rather unreasonable given the broader fiscal picture. Operationally, Deere’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 11.7%, beating out nearly 72% of its peers. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 18.6%, above 72.46%. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin lands at 14.9%, ranked better than 92% of sector players. Also, it enjoys consistent profitability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $470.15, implying nearly 26% upside potential.United Rentals (URI)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBilled as the world’s largest equipment rental company, United Rentals (NYSE:URI) owns approximately 4,700 classes of equipment. In addition, United offers a combined total of over 1,400 locations covering North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Should President Biden win reelection, construction demand might soar, boding well for equipment providers.Enticingly, the market prices URI at a forward multiple of 7.93. As a discount to projected earnings, United ranks better than 82.78% of the competition. Also, URI trades at 4.86 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 10.91 times. Operationally, United posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.9%, ranked better than 71.89% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the aforementioned period is 25.5%, outpacing nearly 85% of the field.Looking to the Street, analysts peg URI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $421.83, implying over 28% upside potential. Though it’s a higher risk, it makes a solid case for the best construction stocks to buy now.Kelly Services (KELYA)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAn office staffing company featuring global operations, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might not immediately figure as one of the top construction companies to invest in. However, Kelly provides staffing solutions for myriad industries, including the construction sector. And frankly, building back better doesn’t mean much if companies don’t have anyone to do so.To be fair, KELYA represents one of the higher-risk stories among construction stocks, with shares down 7% year-to-date. Still, it could attract speculators because of its value proposition. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 9.99. As a discount to projected earnings, Kelly ranks better than 72.19% of the competition. Also, KELYA trades at 0.63 times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median is a lofty 2.14 times.On the balance sheet, Kelly enjoys a cash-to-debt ratio of 2.18, above 61.56% of its peers. However, it had some troubles regarding negative sales growth and net margin. Nevertheless, an improved construction sector outlook could do wonders for the enterprise. On a final note, analysts peg KELYA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $24, implying over 52% growth potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

116,ca97ce50-b32d-352a-80dd-056353201a78,BK,2023-05-12,Should BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF (BKLC) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-mellon-us-large-cap-102010038.html,1683886810,STORY,"['BK', '^GSPC']","[If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF (BKLC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 04/09/2020.The fund is sponsored by Bny Mellon. It has amassed assets over $1.74 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.49%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 8.43% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 32.46% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskBKLC seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR U.S. LARGE CAP INDEX before fees and expenses. The Morningstar US Large Cap Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index designed to measure the performance of U.S. large-capitalization stocks.Story continuesThe ETF has added roughly 10.05% so far this year and is up about 7.72% in the last one year (as of 05/12/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $65.88 and $79.65.The ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 19.40% for the trailing three-year period. With about 215 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesBNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, BKLC is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $309.03 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $380.02 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more countries, head on over to Military Spending by Country in 2023: 5 Largest Defense Budgets. Over the course of the past couple of decades, military technology has changed a lot - but stood the same as well. While today's warfare is opening new domains for militaries, the most important of which is cyber, key technologies have only evolved over time with few new platforms emerging that provide nations with a decisive advantage.Broadly speaking, there are a handful of key technologies that ensure military superiority in today's highly advanced technological race. The first of these is of course nuclear, with only eight countries having publicly declared as having nuclear weapons, and the ninth - Israel - widely believed to possess them. However, just because a country possesses nuclear weapons, does not make it equal in terms of power projection among its peers.  Out of the nine countries, only four have what is called a nuclear triad - namely the ability to launch nuclear weapons from either the air, land, or sea.Naturally, America has the deadliest triad options, with advanced fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) such as the F-16 and the F35 capable of carrying nuclear weapons, and bombers from Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) such as the B-2A Spirit and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s massive B-52 Stratofortress bomber responsible for delivering nuclear hell from the skies above. At the same time, America's Trident missiles, made by Lockheed's space division is often thought to be the deadliest submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in the world, capable of carrying a whopping eight of the deadly W-88 warheads (hydrogen bombs) with each having a yield of 475 kilotons. In comparison, the Russian Layner missile is capable of carrying four 100 kt warheads, and the French M5 is capable of carrying up to ten 110 kT warheads.Story continuesAt the same time, America is also upgrading its well known Minuteman nuclear missiles. Currently made by Boeing, the latest version of the Minuteman is capable of reaching its target up to 13,000 kilometers away from the launch site, with the final warhead traveling at 23 times the speed of sound, or Mach 23 using the W-87 thermonuclear warhead. If this much death and destruction did not excite you, then the U.S. is planning to phase out the latest Minuteman III missiles and replace them with the Grumman made LGM-35 missiles. On this front, the Pentagon awarded the company a massive $13.3 billion contract in 2020, which would also include work from other companies such as Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT). On the warhead front, the W-88 for the Trident is due to be replaced by the W-93 by 2024. The W-97 is a rare breed of a nuclear weapon since it is the first new nuclear warhead that is being designed by America since the Cold War era.While air superiority and dominance are an essential part of the modern day battlefield, especially as the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrated that a lack of Russian air superiority enabled Ukraine's Western allies to deliver crucial equipment to the battlefield, global power projection is best left to aircraft carriers. On this front, especially since it is the biggest defense spender in the world, the U.S. has the most aircraft carriers in the world. Just like nuclear weapons, only a few countries in the world operate aircraft carriers, and America's 11 carriers are greater than the next five countries combined (just like U.S. defense spending). Additionally, all American carriers use nuclear propulsion, and the U.S. is also the only country apart from France to operate such vehicles. A nuclear propelled carrier has a variety of advantages over traditional vessels - the greatest of which is its unlimited range and ability to travel for decades without having to dock. U.S. aircraft carriers are built primarily by Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII)'s subsidiary Newport News Shipbuilding.At the same time, while fighter jets and aircraft carriers command the most awe from civilians, perhaps the deadliest category of weaponized vessel is the silent submarine. Able to evade detection for as long as food and other requirements allow, submarines can be floating underwater anywhere in the world and provide their operator with the lethal advantage of stealth and deadly strike capability as evidenced by the SLBM. On this front as well, being the world's largest defense spender makes America the leader in having the most nuclear powered submarines in the world, with other operators being Russia, China, the U.K., and France. However, and again, just like the defense spending, America has more nuclear submarines than the next five countries in the list. The U.S. also has the highest number of ballistic attack submarines, with the Ohio-class capable of staying underwater for 60 days.Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), one of America's premier defense contractors due to its critical support for the F-35 program and the U.S. Army's plethora of different missiles, and the B-21 bomber shared the progress on its Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) at its fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call. The IBCS is an extension of the F-35's concept of data integration, and uses cross service, multi sensor data in a single platform to streamline battlefield decision making for the Army. At the call, Grumman's chief executive officer Ms. Kathy Warden shared:One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023.IBCS integrate systems that weren’t designed to work together, creating a seamless air and missile defense network and allowing customers to better utilize their defense assets. This capability is needed more than ever to address advanced threats and it’s one where we’ve seen a significant increase in interest across our global customer base with 10 additional countries expressing interest in obtaining this system. We continue to keep our focus on innovating and leveraging our strong position in advanced technology. This includes the development of a new radar for the F-35. This radar is capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats and is compatible with variants of the F-35 aircraft. And we capped off a strong year with the historic unveiling of the B-21 Raider.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the latest defense spending across countries to find out which countries have the largest defense budgets.Military Spending by Country in 2023: 20 Largest Defense BudgetsRuslans Golenkovs/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo compile our list of global military spending and defense budgets in 2023, we started with data from Global Firepower, a statistics based defense spending tracking website.

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

126,1c215a5d-25ff-3842-b5b9-4bead95b700a,LMT,2023-05-12,Does Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-lockheed-martin-nyse-lmt-130019356.html,1683810019,STORY,['LMT'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin What Is Lockheed Martin's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2023 Lockheed Martin had debt of US$15.6b, up from US$11.6b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$2.44b, its net debt is less, at about US$13.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Lockheed Martin's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Lockheed Martin had liabilities of US$17.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$28.0b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$2.44b in cash and US$15.8b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$26.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Lockheed Martin has a huge market capitalization of US$114.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.We'd say that Lockheed Martin's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.5), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 10.9 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. While Lockheed Martin doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Lockheed Martin's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Lockheed Martin generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 81% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewHappily, Lockheed Martin's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its interest cover is also very heartening. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Lockheed Martin takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin  that you should be aware of.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.Billionaire Warren Buffett has time and again proved that he is truly peerless when it comes to investing. His simple style and relentless repetition of age-old, tried and tested and sometimes cliché investing principles make it all look easy. And it seems Buffett’s true genius shines when things are going south for the broader markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that Berkshire also outperforms during recessions and bears markets. The firm says that Berkshire shares have beaten the market for no less than six recessions since 1980 by a median of 4.41 percentage points.During the same time period, Berkshire Hathaway, which is up about 4.5% year to date through May 10, surpassed S&amp;P 500 each time it dropped 20%, beating the broader index by a median of 14.89 percentage points.There are many lessons that could be drawn from decades of jaw-dropping outperformance of the Oracle of Omaha. But the most important and relevant of these is Buffett’s focus on dividends.$5.7 Billion in Cash in a Single YearAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, which cites an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is expected to generate $5.7 billion in cash from its stock portfolio in 2023. Most of this would be coming from dividends. The WSJ report said that a major chunk of this cash would come from some famous dividend stocks that Buffett has huge stakes in.About $1.1 billion would be coming from Chevron, in which Buffett has a huge stake (more on that later in the article). The WSJ report also mentioned that Buffett would collect $700 million each from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while the Oracle of Omaha will collect about $500 million from Kraft Heinz. From American Express, the billionaire’s check would give him about $363 million.Story continuesAll of this looks very simple at the surface. Just find famous dividend companies, invest in them and collect your payments, right? But if it were that simple Warren Buffett would lose his charm and charisma and the world won’t line up to listen to his advice.Buffett's Secret Sauce: ""The Weeds Wither Away in Significance as the Flowers Bloom""In a letter penned last year, Warren Buffett told about his “secret” of success in dividend investing under a heading “The Secret Sauce.” Buffett’s words sum up decades of wisdom and his foresight.Here’s what he said:""In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""There are several other dividend stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in addition to the famous dividend-paying companies we mentioned above. In this article we are going to take a look at all of the important dividend-paying companies in Buffett's portfolio. Dividend payments from these companies would help the legendary investor get $5.7 billion in cash this year.Warren Buffett's Top Dividend PicksOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Berkshire’s 13F portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top dividend-paying companies in which the fund had stakes.

WBA is gaining from persistent partnership growth and a strong focus on strategic execution. The upbeat 2023 guidance looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 26.8% compared with a 28.8% fall of the industry and a 4.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $28.92 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 2.48% on average. However, the company’s long-term projected growth rate of 3% remains behind the industry’s growth projection of 5.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayNew Alliances Look Strategic: The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial. The Prothena partnership follows Walgreens’ vision to work with all the stakeholders to develop and evaluate effective therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.The same month, the U.S. Healthcare segment of Walgreens and VillageMD announced the expansion of Village Medical at Walgreens into Colorado, with three new primary care practices, two in Fort Collins and a third in Longmont. Village MD’s physicians and Walgreens’ pharmacy team members work together to provide patients with cost-effective, expert care for chronic conditions and general illnesses and injuries.Long-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Per the January update, Walgreens Boots noted that U.S. Healthcare targets raised with Summit Health announcement on Nov 7, 2022, including fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5 billion to $16.0 billion, up from $11.0 billion to $12.0 billion previously and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the segment by the end of fiscal year 2023.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking beyond 2023, the company increased clarity into its long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond.Upbeat Guidance: The company projects adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45-$4.65. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.57.The company expects revenues to be $137.5 billion. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $134.6 billion.DownsidesPressure on Margin Continues: In the past few years, the slowdown in the generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margins on a significant level.Competitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds from increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been constant at $4.50.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $136.18 billion, suggesting a 2.6% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The adjusted operating margin in the first quarter contracted 74 bps to 19.7%.Liquidity and Cash PositionCharles River exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $201.6 million compared with $233.9 million at the end of 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the first quarter was $109.4 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $102.6 million.2023 GuidanceThe company has narrowed its 2023 guidance.For 2023, revenue growth is now expected in the band of 2-4.5% (from the earlier band of 1.5-4.5%) on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 5-7.5% (4.5-7.5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.08 billion, indicating a 2.7% rise from 2022.Adjusted EPS for 2023 is now expected in the range of $9.90-$10.90 ($9.70-$10.90). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.18.Our TakeCharles River exited the first quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The results highlighted a more than 15% organic revenue growth, driven by strength across the DSA and RMS business segments. The company registered robust growth in small research models, research model services and the Cell Solutions business.On the flip side, the contraction of both margins and escalating costs are concerning. Headwinds associated with foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and interest expense due to a rising interest rate environment increase concerns.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCharles River currently carries Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Our prepared remarks today will include updates on our key strategic imperatives, some perspective on how the business is performing in Q2 and our outlook for the rest of the year.Starting with our first priority to drive utilization and adoption for AcQMap. Q1 got off to a slow start, but procedure volumes accelerated throughout the quarter with March commercial procedure volumes increasing over 60% on a month-over-month basis. Overall, our commercial procedure volumes increased on a year-over-year basis for the quarter, driven by continued adoption of our full portfolio outside the U.S. and geographic expansion with our partner, Biotronik.U.S. procedure volumes showed steady progress during Q1 and exited the quarter with growth in March. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging trends here in the second quarter and anticipate procedure volumes to ramp sequentially throughout the year and put us back on a strong trajectory for procedures, utilization, and correspondingly, AcQMap disposable product revenue.Over the short, medium and long-term, a major driver in achieving our growth objectives is our product development pipeline. Our portfolio investments are geared toward both strengthening our position and expanding our addressable opportunity. All of these new product launches keep us focused on the complex treatment segment of the EP market, ranging from the most difficult multiple redo patients to first-time persistent AF patients.As we have discussed previously, AcQMap is most regularly used today in redo procedures. Specifically, about 55% of U.S. and 80% of OUS procedures come from redo cases. AcQMap has clear differentiation in these procedures and our clinical results and sustained utilization in these segments underscore our value proposition. At the same time, these procedure categories represent only a portion of the total complex ablation segment. Over the next several years, our pipeline is geared towards further strengthening our position in the re-treatment segment as well as bridging into primary use cases.The innovations required to enter new categories largely center around software, including algorithm development and disposables. These include our next-generation software platforms like AcQMap 9 and AcQMap 10 as well as their therapy and ablation systems. We expect to launch a steady cadence of new products over the course of 2023 and 2024 that will contribute to higher utilization, procedure volume growth and increased revenue per case.We received FDA clearance for AcQMap 8.5 software with AcQBlate features last week, which paved the way for an integrated software platform to pair their ablation system when approved later this year. In addition to our new product pipeline, critical to the adoption of AcQMap will be additional clinical research. Over the course of this year, we have plans to release several data presentations and publications that builds on the UNCOVER AF study that showed freedom from AF in persistent patients of 73% at 1 year. As a reminder, most landmark studies for the treatment of persistent AF using incumbent systems show 1 year success rates in the 50% to 60% range for de novo cases and 60% to 68% in redo cases.In April, data from the RECOVER AF study were published online in EP Europace. This study evaluated an extremely complex patient population and further demonstrated AcQMap's clinical impact in the retreatment segment of the market. Specifically, results showed patients who had only undergone pulmonary vein isolation or PVI before enrollment, achieved 91% freedom from atrial fibrillation at 1 year, while the entire study population with varying prior procedures reported 76% freedom from AF at 1 year. These results further confirm AcQMap's utility and differentiation in the redo market where we expect to drive further penetration into this $700 million category.In addition to the RECOVER AF study, we look forward to this year's Heart Rhythm Society where investigators will present data on AcQMap at a late-breaking special science session on Sunday, May 21. This study evaluated AcQMap to identify non-pulmonary vein triggers in the persistent AF population. Utilizing AcQMap to identify triggers of AF is an emerging use of the technology that can further support expanded utilization. And we expect this study to demonstrate strong clinical outcomes when using AcQMap to guide therapy in complex patients.Beyond this study presentation, we will have a fulsome program in HRS, featuring user group meetings, physician-led presentations at our booth during the conference and several opportunities for customers and business development partners to engage with AcQMap users from across the world. We will also offer the opportunity to get more insight into some of our recently launched products and future pipeline development.Switching gears to our efforts to strengthen our financial performance. We continue to make significant progress during Q1 2023 with year-over-year declines in both non-GAAP operating expenses and cash burn as well as significant improvement in our non-GAAP gross margin. Takeo will cover these topics in more detail during his prepared remarks, but overall, we continue to take the necessary steps to strengthen our financial position and extend the cash runway.Putting this all together, we are pleased with our start to the year and are laying the foundation for stronger performance to the rest of 2023 and thereafter, driven by a steady cadence of new product launches, clinical data and commercial execution. When combined with our operational improvement initiatives, this business trajectory will position us well for the future and allow us to maximize value for all stakeholders.With that, I will now turn the call over to Takeo to walk through our financial results.Takeo MukaiThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. During my remarks today, I will review our first quarter 2023 results as well as provide an update to our full year outlook for 2023.For the first quarter, net revenue of $4.2 million compared to $3.7 million in the year ago first quarter. The 13% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by disposable sales and increases in service, rent and other revenue. We ended the first quarter with an installed base of 77 systems globally, up sequentially from 76% last quarter. Through the balance of the year, we continue to expect growth in our global installed base, while remaining targeted to ensure new consoles are placed into service where we can drive strong procedure adoption. Our priority remains growth in procedure volumes, utilization and revenue per procedure rather than just growing the installed base.Disposables revenue in the first quarter of $3.4 million grew 7% compared to the year ago first quarter, driven by AcQMap disposables growth outside of the United States and growth in left-heart access through our distribution agreement with Medtronic. Similar to the year ago comparable period, we did not record any capital revenue in the first quarter of 2023.Service, rents and other revenue of $0.7 million was up from $0.5 million in Q1 2022. Q1 2023 revenue was impacted with back orders by an estimated $250,000 as we continue to remediate the supply chain disruptions that emerged earlier in the year. We are working diligently to resolve the price constraints and continue to expect full resolution by the end of this year.Non-GAAP gross margin of negative 60% in Q1 2023 improved sequentially from negative 64% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was favorable compared to the negative 119% registered in the first quarter of 2022. This performance represents our strongest quarter since the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year and sequential improvement in our non-GAAP gross margins was primarily driven by improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and improved leverage on higher production volumes.We will continue to dedicate significant attention to improving our gross margins and expect to show further improvement for the full year of 2023 and continue to forecast the path to positive gross margin in Q1 2024. In addition to volumes driving this improved trajectory in gross margins, we remain focused on several ongoing work streams to drive efficiency, reduce product costs through improved yield and bringing select processes in-house.Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, down 39% from the same period last year and down slightly on a sequential basis. We continue to realize the benefits of our discipline around expense management and expect our full year 2023 non-GAAP expenses to decline on a year-over-year basis as compared to 2022. Excluding specified items, our non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2023 was $16.8 million or $0.59 per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2022 or $1 per share.Our total cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $76.7 million. Our cash burn, excluding milestone payments and the employee retention credit was $18 million in the first quarter, down 39% versus the prior year. The first quarter tends to see higher cash burn as accrued annual bonuses were paid out to employees. Our first quarter also saw higher inventory purchases as we replenished supply to support higher current and future projected demand.Overall, we are pleased with the improvements we have made in reducing our quarterly cash burn and we'll continue to drive intense focus on optimizing our financial position. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $19 million to $21 million, driven by growth in AcQMap procedure volumes and associated disposable sales globally, targeted expansion in our installed base and a second half 2023 approval of AcQBlate in the United States.We appreciate your continued interest and support, and I will now turn the call back to the operator to facilitate our Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Marie Thibault at BTIG. Our next question comes from William Plovanic at Canaccord Genuity.John Edward YoungIt's John on for Bill tonight. Congrats on the quarter. If I could just start just on the update for timing for AcQBlate. Just any -- I know you called out second half, but any specific timing for the approval? How should we think about the launch? And then the plans for limited market release? How long could that be?David Harrison RomanSo as we said on our last call, our guidance for the full year contemplated AcQBlate approval in the second half of the year. So that expectation is unchanged from what we had shared in March. As a reminder, obviously, because AcQBlate is already approved and used outside the United States and has been on the market in Europe since March of 2021, the way we would approach a limited market release is probably a little bit different benefits for a completely new-to-market product. So we will start with obviously our highest utilization accounts as it relates to primary targets for AcQBlate. And those accounts that have given us feedback where the integration of an ablation catheter is critical to growing their AcQMap procedures from where we sit today or toward adoption in additional categories. But we would -- obviously, as you know, there will be a process by which we have to go through that committee approval, very consistent with when you launch any other new product. So our current outlook contemplates a fairly modest contribution from AcQBlate in 2023.The one thing I would also just remind you of, as we had -- we had submitted AcQBlate in October of last year. The average PMA review time at the FDA is running right now between 330 and 350 calendar days. So if you use that as sort of a benchmark, that's also probably a good place to kind of land an expected approval. Obviously, we have worked diligently through the FDA deficiency responses that you receive at the 90-day mark and are working through remediation and remain very confident in an approval and launch in the second half of the year.John Edward YoungAnd then just on Q2, the Street is currently at $4.8 million. Can you just talk about the comfort level around that number?David Harrison RomanYeah. So we talked a little bit on the call about the extent to which supply chain challenges had negatively impacted our first quarter results in the range of $250,000. We are actively resolving some of those supply chain challenges. And just to reground everybody, those supply chain dynamics related to our AcQMap basket catheter. There was a period of time earlier this year when we were receiving no raw materials. Those raw materials have since resumed here probably right around the time of our call in late March and we are continuing to rebuild inventory to support future demand. We will not fully resolve supply chain shortages here in the second quarter, but are very confident that they will be resolved through the balance of the year.So the only other thing I would point out as you think about Q2 is, Q1 we did a little bit better than expected. We are raising our outlook a little bit here for the year. Given some of those supply chain dynamics, you may see more of a weighting of revenue in the second half of the year. We had commented on our call -- on the first quarter -- on the fourth quarter that we thought we'd be at about a 45%, 55% weighting first half, second half. That number may look more like the first half being in a range of 40% to 45% in the first half and the balance in the back half.The last thing I just want to mention on supply chain dynamics is, the back orders or inability to supply certain customers at the end of the first quarter has not impacted at all demand for the product. We have not seen lost procedure volumes. Where we do see that as transient, we are not losing the business because AcQMap is used in a very specific subset of cases where there really are no other options for many of the patients being treated. So we are seeing those orders get filled. We are not seeing purchase orders be canceled. So we are -- that's what gives us confidence in the build in revenue throughout the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible) on for Margaret. So in terms of the trajectory of the installed base with it at sitting 433 after the quarter, I think you've talked about pushing the accelerator and kind of making the installed base more of a focus now. So could you just walk us through your approach with some of those high volume centers or users? And then your expectation with the ramp throughout the rest of the year with the first quarter number coming in a bit lower than expected?David Harrison RomanSure. So maybe just to clarify something, the installed base in the first quarter was 77 and we did 451 procedures in the first quarter. We did in the first quarter continue to look to rationalize our installed base and focus on accounts where we can drive procedure volume growth, growth in utilization for console and higher revenue per procedure. One of the things that we did not talk about on the call that was a really big standout for us this quarter was significant growth in our revenue per case in the first quarter. That is really the metric that we -- one of the key metrics that we believe is ultimately an indicator of the health of the business.I recognize the attention to installed base, and it's something we've been reporting since the company went public. In our minds, it is really not an indicator of the performance or the health of the business. We do envision to grow the installed base here in 2023. We expect that we will exit 2023 and each quarter through 2023 with progressive growth in the installed base. Our focus, however, has to be on driving procedure volume growth, driving greater penetration into the categories where AcQMap has clear differentiation and driving increased revenue for a procedure.And if you kind of look at how things are going here in the second quarter, we talked about on the call that we got off to kind of a slow start to the year. We had some very high volume accounts that had lower utilization early in the year. We have seen a significant pick-up in procedure volumes over the course of Q2. And if you dig into that a little bit further, our primary levers to drive growth within high volume users is driving increased utilization of AcQMap across more procedure types. So second redo, first redo, de novo persistent.The second is bringing on new users per account. So now we have a number of accounts where we have multiple users. And then the third is growing -- the third actually is re-engaging former AcQMap users. This is something that has been a really positive contributor here in the second quarter as people who had once used AcQMap and had slowed down utilization for a variety of reasons, we're now seeing pick their utilization back up. And the fourth is going into new accounts and expanding our installed base.Unidentified AnalystAnd sorry for that, net procedures not installed base on the first one. And then just a quick follow-up. And I know it's only been a few weeks since the RECOVER results, but I guess, what did you hear following the release? Was there any excitement amongst users in the U.S. specifically or is that something you're trying to spread more awareness during your conversations at HRS next weekend?David Harrison Roman(inaudible) I think that -- thank you for that question, because RECOVER AF is one of the studies that we've been waiting to get published for a while. And the publication of that data was important for us for a couple of reasons. First, it's the only significant clinical publication we've had in a couple of years, which as you know, in this space, having a continuous flow of clinical data is critical to adoption and sustaining physician engagement.The second is, it really aligned well with kind of our refocused strategy that we've been bringing to market over the past year or so, which has been to uniquely focus our target on complex patients, namely redo cases. So the data from RECOVER does dovetail very well with how we've been going to market and how we've been engaging the physician community over the past year.In the U.S. specifically, we will have quite a bit of attention on RECOVER at HRS at our booth. But even in the interim, since we did have the results get published in April, we have hosted a number of physician meetings. It is definitely driving a significant amount of engagement and a significant amount of attention from the physician community. And where it really helps is in accounts where I would say there are medium-level users to newer users and actually even former users. It's been a great tool to re-engage some of those types of accounts. And I would expect to see some physicians here in the U.S. potentially look to replicate the RECOVER results in the U.S. setting. And that's something that we're exploring as a company as well.So thus far, I've been very happy with the response. I think HRS will be a great opportunity for us to go into the data in a little bit more detail with some of our key users and prospective users. And then I think this is going to drive some additional interest in evaluating AcQMap in this very specific use case in '23 and beyond.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG.Marie Yoko ThibaultI'm back. I hope you can hear me.David Harrison RomanWe can. Yes, Marie.Marie Yoko ThibaultOkay. I'm so sorry. I have tons of technical issues. I probably missed some of your commentary, but sorry about that. So I wanted to ask here about the early qualitative kind of feedback that you hear on the Medtronic sales of the left-heart access products. And is it fair to assume that some of this is showing up in any of the service revenue or anything at this point? How should we think about kind of the very early days of the Medtronic launch?David Harrison RomanSo Medtronic took over commercial distribution very, very late in Q4. And over the past several months, we have been very pleased with how our partnership with Medtronic is progressing. From a commercial perspective, we have been very impressed with the pace at which Medtronic has picked up this product. And unsurprisingly, given their breadth and depth of distribution, has done a fantastic job getting this product into many more hands of prospective users than we ever would have been able to on a standalone basis.From our side, our top focus is making sure that we can continuously deliver them high quality and dependable supply and meet their ever-growing demand. So we are investing additional resources here to ensure that we can continue to support Medtronic's growth. But overall, as I reflect on the growth and development of the agreement and partnership over the past year, we are very pleased with how things are going.Just from a reporting perspective, the impact shows up in a couple of different places. One is on -- is in disposable revenue. And the other is a little bit in the other line and then also on the asset -- on the other line in the income statement on the asset sale gain. And that's where we start to accrue the net sales earn-out that gets paid out on an annual basis in March.Marie Yoko ThibaultAs my follow-up here, maybe one for Takeo. You mentioned gross margins, they came in a bit better than we expected this quarter and you still are holding to that goal of positive gross margin first quarter of next year. How should we think about the ebbs and flows of that metric throughout this year? Is it linear? Is it something a bit more especially as you're making some investments here? How should we think about that gross margin line?Takeo MukaiNo, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making with our gross margins. And there's 2 primary factors. We saw the positive gross margin here on a sequential basis for the last 2 quarters here. And it really comes from the higher production volumes that we have across all of our products in our portfolio. And then the second is, we are seeing the efficiencies and optimizing our manufacturing support and our footprint. So definitely, we're getting to the production volumes that more closely aligns with our manufacturing footprint. So we do expect to see progressive improvement here throughout the quarters. And as we've stated, on path to positive gross margins in the first quarter, that hasn't changed.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. At this time, we conclude the program.

(""Elliott""), which manages funds that have an investment representing an approximately 10% economic interest in The Goodyear Rubber &amp; Tire Company (NASDAQ: GT) (""Goodyear"" or the ""Company""), today sent a letter and presentation to the Board of Directors of Goodyear. According to the letter, the purpose of the materials is to outline the right path forward to create value at Goodyear and realize its full potential.Elliott is one of Goodyear's largest investors because it has strong conviction in the significant value-creation opportunity achievable at the Company, the letter said. Despite the Company's strong brand, leading market share and favorable industry tailwinds, Goodyear's stock has meaningfully and consistently underperformed. The Company's poor stock performance is a direct result of its significant margin erosion, suboptimal go-to-market strategy, and unfocused brand strategy, which have collectively led to a loss of investor confidence, according to the letter.To deliver improved results and restore investor confidence in Goodyear, Elliott believes the Company must pursue the critical steps detailed in its Accelerating Goodyear plan, including:Enhancing Leadership &amp; Oversight: Appoint five new highly qualified independent directors to the Board to improve governance, bring about a cultural change and help restore confidence among investors.Monetizing the Trapped Value of Goodyear's Retail Platform: Explore ways to monetize Goodyear's Company-owned store network, which Elliott believes is nearly worth Goodyear's market capitalization given the multiples of auto aftermarket service businesses.Initiating an Operational Review: Form an Operational Review Committee to develop an operational and margin improvement plan.Story continuesElliott believes these steps will strengthen Goodyear's financial position, bolster its competitiveness globally and create sustainable value, unlocking more than $21 per share in value for shareholders, an increase of 179% to its current share price. Elliott looks forward to engaging with the Board, along with fellow shareholders, as soon as possible.The full letter and presentation can be downloaded at AcceleratingGT.com.The full text of the letter follows:May 11, 2023The Board of DirectorsThe Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company200 Innovation WayAkron, Ohio 44316Attn: Mr. Richard KramerDear Mr. Kramer and Members of the Board:We are writing to you on behalf of Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. (collectively, ""Elliott"" or ""we""), which together have an investment representing an approximately 10% economic interest in The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (the ""Company"" or ""Goodyear""). Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm founded in 1977 that has approximately $55 billion of assets under management. We have established a long and successful record of investing in the automotive sector and working with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers, dealers and finance companies to create sustainable value.We have become one of Goodyear's largest investors because we have strong conviction in the significant value-creation opportunity achievable at the Company today. Goodyear is an iconic U.S. manufacturing leader. As the only remaining publicly traded U.S. tire manufacturer, Goodyear plays an important role in the U.S. economy, commands a leading global position, enjoys a strong brand and is poised to benefit from industry tailwinds.However, despite these advantages, Goodyear's stock has meaningfully and consistently underperformed. Relative to the S&amp;P 400, Goodyear has underperformed by 90% over the past five years and 143% over the past ten years. Relative to proxy peers, key competitors and relevant indices such as the Dow Auto Parts Index, the story of underperformance is similar:Goodyear-Cumulative-Total-Return-Relative-to-PeersIt is an unfortunate fact for Goodyear and its investors that over the past decade, owning Goodyear stock has been a disappointment. We believe the Company's poor stock performance is a direct result of its significant margin erosion, suboptimal go-to-market strategy and unfocused brand strategy, which have collectively led to a loss of investor confidence. This loss of confidence has had other consequences: The Company now finds itself capital-constrained and unable to pursue value-creating opportunities, such as high-ROIC investments to support growing its valuable retail store platform.Our investment in Goodyear is underpinned by our confidence that, with improved financial flexibility and the right oversight in place, the Company has significant upside. In fact, it is rare to find a company with as much potential to increase shareholder value; we believe that by following the recommendations detailed below, the Company can create an additional $21 per share in value – a ~179% increase to its current share price, without any valuation multiple uplift.In this letter and the appended presentation, we lay out our perspectives on the best path forward for Goodyear. We look forward to working with the Board and our fellow shareholders to realize the value-creation opportunity at hand and to ensure the success that Goodyear's shareholders, employees and customers deserve.Goodyear TodayWe have tremendous respect for Goodyear and its celebrated history. For 125 years, Goodyear has been a manufacturing leader in the United States. Soon after its founding, Goodyear became the world's largest tire manufacturer and the supplier of tires for the Ford Model T. During the First and Second World Wars, Goodyear developed critical equipment for the U.S. military, including observation aircraft and tanks as well as plane and Navy vessel components. For the latter half of the 20th century, the Company continued its expansion, developing petrochemical centers, opening its first retail stores and growing to more than 100 global plants. Since 2000, the Company has exited the private-label tire business, constructed a new headquarters in Akron and acquired Cooper Tire.More recently, however, Goodyear's legacy has been undermined by the Company's (i) industry-low operating margins; (ii) underutilized retail platform; and (iii) loss of investor confidence, which have driven material stock price underperformance.(i) Industry-Low Operating Margins: Despite leading scale, Goodyear's margins are the lowest in the tire industry, trailing its closest peers, Michelin and Bridgestone, by ~700 basis points. Not only has the Company failed to close the margin gap vs. these peers, but in recent years the gap has continued to widen. Further, the fallout from the Company's suboptimal tire-distribution strategy has negatively affected both its top and bottom lines, while an unfocused brand strategy has prevented the Company from optimizing the value of its product portfolio.(ii) Underutilized Retail Platform: Goodyear currently owns ~1,025 top-rated auto service retail stores, but has failed to leverage its industry-leading consumer brand into growing a high-value retail platform. Over the past five years, the number of Goodyear Auto Service stores has contracted, whereas public peers have grown their footprints substantially. Well-capitalized and efficiently operated automotive aftermarket service businesses trade in both the public and private markets at valuations dramatically higher than where Goodyear trades today.(iii) Loss of Investor Confidence: Over the past several years, Goodyear has failed to deliver on expected financial performance. The Company missed investor day targets set in 2016 by nearly 70% and has consistently lowered and pushed out margin improvement promises. At the same time, Goodyear has increased invested capital by $4 billion since 2016, only for Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) to decline by 42% (while peers' NOPAT has grown). As a result of these missteps, among others, market sentiment on Goodyear is profoundly negative, and the market has ""orphaned"" the stock, as illustrated by the Company's minimal sell-side coverage.We have reached these conclusions after an exhaustive research and diligence process. As part of our outside-in work, we engaged in thorough due diligence with the help of top-tier consultants, legal counsel and investment bankers, and conducted scores of interviews with former Company employees, fellow shareholders and industry executives. This process has indicated that substantial improvement in all of the areas outlined above is both necessary and achievable in the near term.Accelerating GoodyearOur goal at Goodyear is to reverse this period of negative performance and set the Company on a path to sustainable value creation. To achieve this objective, we believe the Company should take the following steps:Enhance Leadership &amp; Oversight: Appoint five new highly qualified independent directors to the Board to improve governance, bring about a cultural change and help restore confidence among investors. Elliott has identified several experienced executives to spearhead Goodyear's Board enhancement.Monetize the Trapped Value of Goodyear's Retail Platform: Explore ways to monetize Goodyear's Company-owned store network, which we believe is nearly worth Goodyear's market capitalization given the multiples of auto aftermarket service businesses. The Company could use proceeds to pay down debt, improving its balance sheet and financial flexibility. We estimate that a sale of these stores would generate an increase of more than $4 per share in the Company's stock price, while allowing the retail platform to grow under more focused and better-capitalized ownership.Initiate an Operational Review: Form an Operational Review Committee to develop an operational and margin improvement plan. We estimate that a comprehensive review of Goodyear's SG&amp;A costs could drive at least 114 basis points of margin improvement, while a redesign of Goodyear's go-to-market and brand strategies could drive an incremental 271 basis points of operating margin expansion. Together, these initiatives could create more than $16 per share of value at the Company.We believe that, taken together, these steps will strengthen Goodyear's financial position, bolster its competitiveness globally and create sustainable value, potentially driving Goodyear's stock price to exceed $32 per share (~179% upside from current levels). Moreover, we believe all of these steps are achievable in the near term.For the avoidance of doubt, we are not calling for any reductions in plant capacity or factory workforce. Nor are we calling for any increases in leverage. On the contrary, the changes we are seeking at Goodyear would reduce leverage, accelerate growth and lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future.Next StepsIn closing, we want to reiterate our deep respect for Goodyear. Few manufacturing companies have played as important a role as Goodyear in American history. Given the scale of the issues the Company faces and the urgency of addressing them, we are sharing this letter and our related materials publicly at AcceleratingGT.com.We believe that our recommendations – enhancing leadership and oversight, monetizing Goodyear's retail platform, and developing a margin improvement plan – will make Goodyear a better company for its customers, employees and shareholders for decades to come.As a next step, we look forward to discussing our recommendations with the Board, and we will make ourselves available at your earliest convenience. Our hope is to align in the coming weeks on the best path forward.Sincerely,Marc SteinbergSenior Portfolio ManagerAustin CamporinPortfolio ManagerAbout ElliottElliott Investment Management L.P. manages approximately $55.2 billion of assets as of December 31, 2022.

The bottom line also outdid the year-ago period’s reported figure of 41 cents. The outperformance was due to higher-than-expected contributions from one major segment — Northeast G&amp;P. Adjusted EBITDA from the segment totaled $470 million, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $453 million. The figure also increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis.Williams’ revenues of $3.1 billion in the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion. The top line also outperformed the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.5 billion, which could be attributed to increased revenues from service.Williams Companies, Inc.

Cash flow from operations totaled $1.51 billion, up 39.8% from that recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.Segmental AnalysisTransmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico: The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $728 million, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely driven by much higher service revenues from Transco’s recent in-service Leidy South expansion project.West: This segment registered an adjusted EBITDA of $286 million, 10% higher than $260 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter. The improvement resulted from contributions from Trace Midstream and the benefits of realized gains on natural gas hedges.Northeast G&amp;P: Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was $470 million, up 12.4% from the prior-year quarter’s $418 million. This uptick can be attributed to higher volumes at Ohio Valley Midstream, Marcellus South and Cardinal.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated an adjusted EBITDA of 231 million compared with $65 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside reflects higher commodity marketing margins and a $390-million net favorable change in unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetTotal costs and expenses amounted to $1.72 billion in the reported quarter.Total capital expenditure was $525 million compared with $316 million a year ago.

152,cb285f81-5e2a-3f8b-862a-b9f9e974ef31,BA,2023-05-12,Analysis-Jet orders boom as airlines fear shortage,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-jet-orders-boom-airlines-104633081.html,1683888393,STORY,['BA'],"[By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Planemakers can't build them but airlines can't stop buying them.Even as they wrestle with industrial problems preventing the delivery of jets sold before the pandemic, Airbus and Boeing are totting up billions of dollars of new orders stretching beyond 2030 amid a rebound in air travel.From Air India to Ireland's Ryanair and a new national airline in Saudi Arabia, a handful of carriers have placed firm or provisional orders for 700 jets.Turkish Airlines' surprise announcement on Thursday that it plans to order 600 jets in June spells what would be the fourth mega-deal in a few months - upstaging Air India's record order for 470 Airbus and Boeing jetliners.Turkey's national champion last month announced a 10-year strategic plan including a goal of 170 million passengers by 2033, compared to over 85 million in 2023.""They are aspiring to build a mega-connector airline from everywhere in Europe to everywhere in Asia and Africa,"" said Rob Morris, head of global consultancy at UK-based Ascend by Cirium.That would intensify a battle for connecting traffic between Istanbul's hub and rival centres in Europe and the Middle East.The announcement surprised many in the industry, however.U.S. industry analyst Richard Aboulafia highlighted its timing - days before Turkey's May 14 elections - and noted the weight simultaneously being given to strategic aerospace projects including a fighter, attack helicopter and drones.""And now this plan to make Turkey an airline centre of the world too. The timing looks almost too coincidental,"" Aboulafia, managing director of Aerodynamic Advisory, said.An order of such magnitude could also become swept up in broader political topics such as discussions over Turkey's objection to Sweden joining NATO, Jefferies analysts cautioned.Regardless of the scope or timing, however, analysts said Turkish Airlines' announcement marked a strong statement of intent as carriers that survived the pandemic fight for market share without waiting for global supply chains to stabilise.Story continuesOVERLAPPING DEMANDIstanbul, where President Tayyip Erdogan opened a new $12 billion airport in 2018, is seen by many as a geographically efficient location to challenge major hubs in Dubai and Doha.Chairman Ahmet Bolat said Turkish Airlines would order 200 long-haul jets and 400 smaller narrow-bodies needed to feed such traffic. The airline's fleet is roughly split between Airbus and Boeing.Pressure to act was highlighted by Ryanair, whose boss admitted this week to paying more than in the past to secure dwindling supplies of narrow-bodies later this decade.""Airlines are getting worried about future new aircraft availability and so are perhaps getting spooked into ordering early,"" Morris said.The risk, a senior industry source warned, is that multiple airlines are buying planes to try to serve the same travel demand. The resulting overhang could trim profits more broadly.""It's a civil arms race. Everyone is buying the same planes for the same people - who knows who is going to win? Probably no-one,"" the source said.As well as being the world's sixth largest pre-COVID tourist destination, Turkey already competes with Gulf majors Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad for transit traffic. Riyadh Air joined the super-connector race with a major Boeing order in March.Locking in jets so far ahead also involves a gamble on inflation, with escalation clauses potentially adding billions to the value of a large order by the time planes are delivered from the end of this decade.Only airlines with strict control of costs or strong political support can afford such exposure, experts said.The boom also comes at a time when airlines face growing pressure to cut emissions.Critics say ordering planes so far ahead risks diverting attention from a new generation of single-aisle jets, which are expected to become available from the mid- to late 2030s.Planemakers say currently sold jets are already significantly cleaner than the ones they replace and therefore maximise the benefit from new fuels that are seen as the industry's best hope of meeting net-zero targets in 2050.But some strategists also see an effort by fast-growing airlines to bring forward purchases of current-generation jets in anticipation of a shortage leading up to technology change.""The industry will argue this is part of their net-zero strategy because they are efficient aircraft. But they will still be in service in 2050, so that would put a limit on fuel improvements from now to then,"" a senior industry adviser said.(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Mark Potter)]"
153,2ed91005-6658-3647-978c-62eb1db40641,BA,2023-05-12,Small aerospace suppliers press for better protections against rising costs,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-aerospace-suppliers-press-better-100926082.html,1683886166,STORY,"['EADSY', 'BA']","[By Allison Lampert, Abhijith Ganapavaram and Valerie InsinnaMONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CEO of Canadian aerospace supplier Abipa International would not negotiate further when a potential customer recently pressed for additional price cuts on components used in areas like engines and landing gear.That stance by CEO Jean Blondin is one that more and more of his peers in different countries are taking these days.For many small suppliers, who regularly face cost pressures from aerospace giants, soaring inflation and demand for plane parts are generating fresh leverage to protect margins. Drawing hard lines can be tough, however, when planemakers offer high order volumes.At least six suppliers interviewed by Reuters said they are adding inflation clauses, or pressing for better pricing. Their comments help provide a rare look at how the less-visible lower rungs of the supply chain are pushing up planemaking costs.The new demands by the small aerospace suppliers come as planemakers Boeing Co and Airbus SE wrestle with labor and parts shortages.

Drawing hard lines can be tough, however, when planemakers offer high order volumes.At least six suppliers interviewed by Reuters said they are adding inflation clauses, or pressing for better pricing. Their comments help provide a rare look at how the less-visible lower rungs of the supply chain are pushing up planemaking costs.The new demands by the small aerospace suppliers come as planemakers Boeing Co and Airbus SE wrestle with labor and parts shortages.

SomaLogic disclaims any intention or obligation, except as required by law, to update or revise any financial projections or forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.I will now turn the call over to Adam Taich, Interim Chief Executive Officer.Story continuesAdam TaichThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's been a busy 6 weeks since stepping into the CEO role. There is work to do and decisions to make, but I remain excited to lead SomaLogic into this next phase with a talented and dedicated team. During my portion of the call today, I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter results and some of my early impressions before turning the line to Shaun, our CFO, who will then review our financial results for the first quarter.In our last call, we announced significant changes to the leadership and the board and committed to focusing resources to serve our life sciences customers. The changes are centered around a simple objective, driving accelerated and predictable growth while improving operational rigor and significantly reducing spend. We are leading innovators in the proteomics market and we know what we need to do to execute on this objective. Revenue for the first quarter was $20.4 million, tracking in line with our full-year outlook.In addition, our expense reduction initiatives are on track and we continue to actively assess opportunities to take our cost discipline further, reflecting our commitment to running the business efficiently with a focus on disciplined cash management to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. Plenty of work remains ahead. SomaLogic is just starting to become a scaled global commercial enterprise. In recent years, the transition has been too slow and the spend too high and we are focused on fundamentally changing that dynamic.Translating our assets, most importantly, our innovative technology into sustainable revenue growth requires commercial execution, and as part of that process, thoughtful customer engagement. This takes time and requires some shifts in how we develop and deliver innovation, support and service across the SomaLogic platform.Today, we are focused on expanding our commercial base where we saw a nice traction over the course of the first quarter. We continue to see ample opportunity to scale our existing customers, while we grow and diversify our biopharma engagements across clinical, translational and early discovery projects. Our operations are currently focused in North America, but we see significant opportunity to expand to new customers domestically and in EMEA and APAC. To this end, we recently announced a key partnership with BioStar, a Shanghai-based leader in life sciences to support our commercial rollout in China. This builds on our partnership with G42, our first authorized site in the Middle East, which we announced earlier this year. An important contributor to commercial excellence is offering solutions to customers that meet their specific needs. To accomplish this, we are making our platform more accessible in large part by accelerating our authorized site or kits offering, so that institutions around the world can run the SomaScan assay in their own lab. We expect to double the number of our sites by the end of 2023.We also remain on track with our partnership with Illumina to deliver the SomaScan assay utilizing Illumina's market-leading installed base of next-generation sequencers with the full force of Illumina's commercial team equipped and incentivized to market and sell our proteomics platform. We continue to expect early access to begin in 2024.Bolstering our suite of solutions is our ongoing work to bring more comprehensive, biologically relevant information to customers. As we drive forward in contact leadership, we are pleased to reiterate that our SomaScan 10,000-plex solution is on track for the fourth quarter rollout.As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our balance sheet and cash position remain a key differentiator for our business, especially in this current market environment. Today, while we remain heads down on operational and commercial execution, the Board and I are actively evaluating inorganic opportunities, including those that could fundamentally change our business profile. In closing, 6 weeks in, I have continued confidence and positioning SomaLogic to increase revenue and improve margins while spending less capital. It's a simple statement that requires hard work and discipline. But we are focused on delivering against these objectives and building shareholder value.I will now turn the call to Shaun Blakeman, CFO, to review our financial performance and outlook.Shaun M. BlakemanThanks, Adam. Turning to our financial results for the first quarter. Revenue for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was $20.4 million, an 11% decrease from $23 million in the same period of the prior year. This quarter's revenue was in line with our expectations and reflects continued customer expansion as our commercial team matures and achieve higher productivity. In the comparison of Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2022, it's worth noting that Q1 of 2022 benefited from $3 million of NEB licensing revenue. And net of that number, our revenue growth was 2% year-over-year. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2023 was 39.6% compared to 49.3% in the first quarter of the prior year. Gross margins were driven down primarily by customer mix, including assay services completed for our work with the Human Technopole Institute.As mentioned during our last earnings call, we expect full year gross margins will return to the 50% plus range as customer mix shifts in future quarters. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $48.3 million, an 8% increase from $44.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. R&amp;D expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $14.1 million compared to $13.8 million in the first quarter of 2022.Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $34.2 million, including nearly $1.3 million in non-cash executive transition charges compared to $30.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. On a cash basis, our operating expenses aligned with our expense reduction efforts. For clarity, our full year GAAP operating expenses are expected to be around $170 million with stock compensation being approximately $25 million.Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2023 was a loss of $36.1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $32.3 million in the first quarter 2022. Please see our press release on file with the SEC as of this afternoon for a reconciliation between GAAP net loss and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. And we ended the quarter with $500.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As expected, Q1's burn of $39 million was higher than we anticipate for the remainder of the year due to the impact of various 2022 restructuring charges. We expect more modest restructuring charges in Q2 with quarterly cash burn decreasing sequentially for the remainder of the year. We reiterate our guidance of $120 million or less in total cash burn for 2023.Turning to our full year outlook. We are reiterating our 2023 revenue guidance of $80 million to $84 million, driven primarily by assay services and product sales. We believe this guidance range reflects the appropriate outlook for our business as we lay the foundation from equal top line expansion in future years. As Adam expressed, our primary objective in 2023 is to apply more rigorous focused process and fiscal discipline across the organization. Our progress in the first quarter is reflective of that with our commercial performance and cash burn tracking to plan.At this point, I would like to turn the call back to Adam.Adam TaichThanks, Shaun. With that, we will open it up to questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of TD Cowen.Daniel Gregory BrennanMaybe just starting on the kit business. Are you talking about doubling the number of customers year-over-year? I think on the first quarter call, you discussed maybe a gating factor was some of the robotics, the upfront stuff. So maybe just give us some color on kind of how that's going, the kit rollout, maybe some color on how many kits customers you have? Any context for the revenue contribution you're expecting this year? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.Adam TaichYes, Dan, thanks for that. It's Adam here. So yes, we're still 100% committed to doubling the number of sites that we have by year-end. So when we last got together, we had 8 sites. We continued to make great traction and we're highly confident that we can at least double the number of sites that we have by year-end. As it relates to kit contribution, it isn't something we've pulled out or sort of teased out from our guidance. But one of the things that we're highly confident in is as we select the right partners, that's part of thinking about sort of you mentioned gating, we don't have any gating issues as it relates to the robotics per se. It's really just ensuring we've got the right partners in the right geographies that can hit the ground running. So while I would expect in certain areas, there could be a wider range of pull-through for customer as we get these things up and running. We're doing our best to ensure that sort of country-by-country, territory by territory we're selecting those partners that we think can be the most successful partners for us.Daniel Gregory BrennanOkay. Maybe on biopharma, there's been a lot of noise this quarter-to-date across the industry with emerging biopharma, tapping the brakes, even some large pharma. We've seen some pauses particularly for instruments. Maybe give us some color kind of what you're seeing with -- in Q2 and the funnel and kind of any help on maybe what's contracted this year from some of your larger customers?Adam TaichSure, Dan. I think for us, there is a blessing and a curse of having fairly small share of wallet at many of these accounts. And so I think for us, we're not really seeing a lot of that brake tapping that you mentioned. We're still not active at some of the accounts where I'm highly confident we could and will be active. And so for us, it's really about taking those existing accounts that we have, penetrating further into those accounts with the value of the SomaScan platform. And then in terms of knocking on new doors, it's something we've been able to do successfully as we've grown our commercial effort over the last couple of quarters.Daniel Gregory BrennanAnd then -- and then maybe on the gross margin. So Shaun, you mentioned you had that, maybe it was a one big contract, maybe there are some others. I know you've signed on a couple of these big deals that are lower margin because they are important, but can you give us a sense if you strip, like how much that big deal or deals contributed to this lower gross margins which missed your guidance in the first quarter? And then, how much visibility and confidence you have in getting north of 50% or 50% plus by year -- for the full year?Shaun M. BlakemanYes, nothing has fundamentally changed. I mean it was -- it was a little off again due to some kind of low, small number type of adjustments in the COGS. But it was all really due to that transitory customer mix as we mentioned in the call, Dan. And we're very confident when you look at the core business outside of that, it does reflect those 50% margin. So we're confident that we'll see the business go back to that net of those transitory mix issues.Daniel Gregory BrennanAnd then -- sorry, for a couple, just maybe 2 more. Any help on pacing from here? You guided for the first quarter at the end of March, so I think most of us felt like you'd pretty good visibility, you guys sound good in terms of how things are going out of the gate, Adam with you -- kind of at the helm. But how do we think about at least Q2 and/or you want to give us any help on how do you paces out?Shaun M. BlakemanYes, this is Shaun again. I would say that looking at our guide that would imply that each quarter is not going to be a lot different from the others throughout the year. But I would think about it in terms of having a modest bias in the second half if kits ramp up.Daniel Gregory BrennanGot it. And then maybe final one. Adam, you talked in the beginning about it takes time and requires shifts to show traction. So I'm just wondering, could you give us a little flavor on that? Maybe, it sounds a little bit more like obviously you're still a very young company, but just kind of -- what have you observed? You've been at the company I think for maybe a couple of years, but what -- what are you observing now in terms of penetrating customers and things of that nature?Adam TaichYes. Thanks, Dan. Yes, so Dan it's a company a little over a year and I am just a couple of months into this role, I think a couple of things that I'll just note, just sort of reiterating the sort of comments from earlier. It's really important to meet customers where they want to be met. And so we're not present in certain geographies. It's impossible for us to get share of wallet in those areas. So we're working on fixing that. I think the second thing I would mention around kits, we've been slow to get that rolled out. And we know and this is something just for my history and experience in the industry, it's absolutely critical. Not everyone wants to be doing business in a services model and sending samples to us here in Boulder, Colorado. And so the kits model is a huge driver. And then the ongoing diversification of our product platform, including our relationship with Illumina, which will give us access to their installed base and their commercial team. For NGS, it's going to be critical to our growth going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel.Daniel Anthony AriasAdam, maybe on China and the BioStar partnership. When does the Shanghai site go live? And is the 7,000 assay content is going to be available, both as a service and kit next year? And then can you just talk about the sales presence that you have in Asia right now? I think last year the plan was to go from -- from basically no add to 10 or so. So where is that building? Where might you finish the year?Adam TaichYes. Thanks, Dan. So, yes -- and thanks for mentioning the partnership with BioStar, something I'm very excited about. And so we expect to be live and certified at that site by the end of the second quarter. And we will be -- that will be the 7k assay for your question. And they will be running that as a -- as a service, but it's an authorized site. So that will be kits customer for us, essentially processing samples on behalf of their -- they have a commercial channel, so on behalf of their customers. And that will give us access to a wide range of biopharma and academic and government accounts there in the country of China. More broadly to the second part of your question, Dan, on the sales presence in Asia. We're at about 10 people right now. We've been deliberate and focused in terms of those geographies where we feel like we can have the biggest impact. And those are areas that also -- we would expect like we did in Singapore and like we've done now and announced in China, we will be enabling those territories really through an authorized site through distributed kits model.Daniel Anthony AriasOkay, great. Maybe just a follow-up, just thinking about some of the catalysts over the next 12 to 18 months, I wanted to ask about the Illumina partnership. Are the terms of that deal, when it comes to just fees and economics, are they set? And if so, can you remind us how that work? And just as an update, maybe where are you in terms of key milestones in just overall tech development?Adam TaichYes. So the terms are set, and as it relates to those -- those were -- we did file that agreement. So just punches sort of back into that in terms of what we disclosed, that is still the prevailing document that governs our agreement together. Tech milestones, everything is going really well. I've been nothing, but thrilled with the engagement from all levels of the company with the Illumina team is extremely engaged and passionate about getting this product out to market. Progress is going quite well and we still are on track to have early access in 2024, which is what we announced in the original plan.Daniel Anthony AriasOkay. Okay, maybe just if Dan is going to hit the half a dozen mark on the questions, maybe I'll feel comfortable sticking a third in here. Just going back to the partnership in Asia, should we think about something similar for Europe? EMEA was on the list of strategic focus this last year, I'm just wondering if a similar approach might be taken.Adam TaichYes, sure. Thank you, Dan. It is. I mean one of the things we've been able to do in EMEA is penetrate that market with our services offering, but again there's limitations to that. But certainly supply chain, getting cold samples from the U.K. to Boulder is easier than getting them from Australia to Boulder. And so while we do have a good services business in EMEA, we do expect that a good chunk of the growth and part of that strategy there will be enabled, those authorized sites just to give folks a distributed kit solution there in the markets as well as the option certainly of sending samples back to us at headquarters in Boulder if they so desire.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kyle Mikson of Canaccord.Kyle Alexander MiksonCongrats on the quarter. Can you just talk about the product revenue this quarter kind of below our model? What happened with kits that you didn't already discussed on the call earlier?Shaun M. BlakemanThis is Shaun. Well, I mean I would point out that still year-over-year we're approximately 300% growth in kits. I think it's -- in its early -- the early rollout of the kits, probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves and trying to read too much into each quarter. The real metric here, as Adam put out, is really the installation pace. We're still confident about our ability to more than double the number kit sites. So as far as our expectations for this year, it's really not reflected in that Q1 number, does not mean that happened. It's just again -- just -- as we rollout, I would expect that to be something that you're not going to necessarily see something go sequentially every quarter and so we have a larger installed base.Kyle Alexander MiksonOkay. So maybe you could talk -- maybe Adam just talk about the order funnel and kind of pent-up demand for the 10k launch later in 2023. I mean, I'm just curious whether there could be like an air pocket here or there's going to be some delayed orders potentially just given that really exciting products coming out pretty soon.Adam TaichYes. Thanks, Kyle. We're the content leader today with our 7k product. And so while our customers are very excited to get their hands on 10k, we aren't seeing stalling as a result of that. We've got ongoing pipeline that's very strong, both on the service side of things as well as the enthusiasm around kits. But everything is on track, as I mentioned earlier, as it relates to our 10k launch. We're super excited to continue to extend our -- our technology leadership in that area.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.Brandon CouillardAdam back on the new China partner BioStar, press release noted they have over 1,000 customers. Just curious, how many of those do you think are potential proteomics opportunities for them to service with SomaScan?Adam TaichYes, sure, Brandon. I'd like to say all of them, a huge number. I mean one of the reasons that we selected BioStar, I would say there's 2 or 3 really strong reasons. One, just incredible track record there in the market with innovative technologies, being driven up multinational corporations like ourselves. Two, great commercial reach. So they've been a distributor for a variety of technologies, so they've got a very strong selling presence in the country. But third, one of the things that's extremely attractive and ultimately why we selected them is the strength of their services business. They have a deliberate focus. It isn't just an afterthought or something that they sort of doing as on the side. They have a deliberate focus on having the most innovative technologies in their lab with highly trained and skilled operators running. And so they've got a fantastic customer base that spans the biopharmas that are headquartered in the country of China as well as those that aren't, as well as incredible relationships with many of the large academic and government institutions in the country.Brandon CouillardOkay. And then any chance you're able to share an updated statistic in terms of total number of customers over the last 12 months? I think the last number you gave was 162. And any color between pharmas and academia researchers in terms of demand in the period?Adam TaichYes, sure, Brandon. I can take the second part of your question first. We're roughly 55% or so biopharma in terms of our customers from a revenue perspective, smaller as it relates to total captive customers. You're right, we did disclose just a couple of weeks back when we were together for our year end, that 162 and we continue to grow our customer base. For us, the couple of things I think to focus on as it relates to really where we have our internal focus. When we are talking about customers, 160, that's -- for us that could be a large biopharma is one in that type of count. And so for us, what we're really focused on is ensuring that we're extending our reach within the existing customers that we have, so that we're penetrating different therapeutic areas, different areas, different geographies of those, particularly for some of the larger biopharmas. And then, of course, we're trying to continue to extend and expand our reach into new customers. And so it's a huge focus for us and we're measuring that from an internal perspective. It's one of the key measurements for our commercial efforts.OperatorAt this time, I would now like to turn it back to Adam Taich for closing remarks.Adam TaichYes. I want to thank you all for joining us. We're excited about the progress that we're making and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now.Value stocks were clear winners in 2022. As inflation spiked and the Federal Reserve started to boost interest rates, investors fled risky stocks with huge valuations and favored cheap value stocks with realistic multiples. Come 2023, the economic realities that caused a panic in the market remain intact. That’s why major analysts are still recommending piling into value playsAccording to Wall Street Journal, investment firm GMO expects growth stocks to fall further while the firm believes value stocks remain discounted.The report added that about 21% of GMO’s $4.3 billion portfolio was invested in hedge funds seeking to profit from the fall in growth stocks.Tech stocks jumped to new highs recently on the back of optimism that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree is nearing its end. Some analysts believe the market is incorporating the possibility of rate cuts. Prudent investors and analysts are rejecting this optimism and warning that the latest rally in stocks might not last.In February, Goldman Sachs analyst’s analyst Lisa Shalett issued a similar warning:""We remain cautious about the direction of the equities market this year, as these other assets do not confirm the optimistic outlook implied by stocks’ performance. Equity investors are sending prices and valuation multiples higher, with little consideration for broader implications. The likely impacts of tightening monetary policy, corporate earnings vulnerability and uncertainty around the path of inflation are additional reasons for prudence.""In January 2023, Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer gave a bullish outlook for value stocks and said that tech valuations were inflated despite massive declines in share prices, According to the analyst,“As big cap technology sees further margin pressure, commodity prices rise and real interest rates remain higher, we think this trend has further to go.”Story continues""Priced for Perfection""Similarly, Bob Doll, Crossmark Global Investments CIO, recently said in a program on CNBC that the market is priced for “perfection.” The analyst said that economic indicators “haunt” him as he believes the possibility of a soft landing is thin. Doll said last year’s market decline was mostly due to “valuation compression” while this year’s declines will be because of “earnings problems” and “recession.” Answering a question about the possible options for investors in this environment, Doll recommended diversification and said he’s underweight tech. He thinks many tech stocks have been “lagging and struggling.” Doll recommended investors to own value stocks that are not just cheap but has some “current momentum.”Value has “returned with a vengeance,” to quote a JPMorgan’s report, which said that while growth stocks have outperformed value stocks for a long time in the past, the future outlook for value plays look strong. Here’s what the report said:“Value’s potential for future returns remains great. Valuation spreads between Value and Growth are still extreme, and higher than those at the peak of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) bubble. The proportion of equity assets invested with a Value investment style is also very low, meaning flows could provide a significant tailwind.”In this backdrop, it’s a good idea to take a look at stocks that have attractive value multiples, strong profits and  fundamentals.Most Profitable Value Stocks NowOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used a stock screener to find stocks with PE ratios of less than 15 as of April 27 and positive revenue growth. From this list, we picked stocks that have the highest net income (TTM) and the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:OGE) ranks 16th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now. In February OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) posted full-year 2022 results. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $3.32, easily beating estimates. Revenue in the period totaled $3.37 billion, beating estimates by $2.31 billion. OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) is a high-yield dividend stock, with an over 4% yield.17 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds were long OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.15. Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) ranks 15th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now. In March Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) posted solid Q1 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at C$3.05, beating estimates by C$0.12.

Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) in March declared a quarterly dividend of CAD 1.32 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. The forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.81%.14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21French energy giant TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) is one of the most profitable value plays.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE).ClearBridge International Value Strategy made the following comment about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection in the energy sector was also a strong driver of returns, benefiting from an improving global macro outlook. Prospects for a milder recession, increased demand from China reopening from its COVID-19 restrictions, and the recognition that the market hasn’t discounted oil company valuations based on commodity prices all served to benefit energy company stock prices. Holdings such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), a leading French oil, and natural gas company, was a recipient of these macro tailwinds. We are constructive on the long-term prospects of the energy sector, with it being the second largest relative overweight in the portfolio. We believe that as the market becomes more comfortable with the industry’s intermediate earnings and capital discipline from producers, our high-quality companies in the sector should continue to perform.”13.

Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $266 million stake in the company.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.”11. WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:WCC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Raymond James recently gave a Strong Buy rating for WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:WCC). The firm said WESCO International, Inc.

Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) posted its Q4 results back in February. Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK)’s adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.59, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter jumped 20.1% year over year to reach $2.39 billion, beating estimates by $70 million.

The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Chemicals and fertilizer company The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) ranks 9th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now.

Revenue in the quarter jumped about 16.7% year over year to $4.48 billion, beating estimates by $260 million.In February The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was payable on March 30.White Brook Capital made the following comment about The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS): Despite favorable midterm fertilizer dynamics, Mosaic (MOS) performed worse than expected during the quarter. Significantly, the Company began to rally in the last days of the quarter after it preannounced production at the low end of the guidance for the first quarter when market fears were for an even worse outcome.  Given March weather, particularly in the northern United States, where a significant snow pack continued to cover farmland (as of the first days of April), I expect their 1stquarter earnings call will speak to significant second-quarter demand, particularly as the weather was more favorable for fertilizer usage in early April. Prices during the second week of April for fertilizers broadly also have begun to lessen their decline despite a continued rapid decline in other feedstock commodities.The stock has been driven by concern about destroyed 2023 demand that I believe, given the state of the world’s depleted fields, issues that demand can no longer be destroyed, only delayed, and even that may not be necessary given the rapid improvement of the US’s northern grain basket and the solid fundamentals in Brazil.  The Company continues to trade for a very cheap valuation even though it generates strong free cash flow, returns that cash flow to shareholders, and is under levered. We continue to hold our position.”8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Defense giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the most notable value stocks right now. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) keeps winning major contracts from the US government for several defense and aerospace activities. It was recently awarded a $158.13 million definitized contract action for Global Hawk (RQ-4) aircraft sustainment.Morgan Stanley added Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its 30 for 2025 stock picks list.LRT Capital made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its October investor letter:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7. United Rentals, Inc.

(NYSE:URI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) rents equipment primarily to construction and industrial companies, as well to as manufacturers, utilities, homeowners, municipalities, and other government entities. The company has benefitted from the continued tightness throughout the machinery sector, as original equipment manufacturers struggle to meet demand due to ongoing supply chain constraints. Activity within most of its major customer verticals remains strong, and the company sees itself as well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends such as the reshoring of global supply chains and increased infrastructure investment.”6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Oil giant Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) received bullish comments from Scotiabank's Paul Cheng recently.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 4.4% increase in share prices after a year of 5.8% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wells Fargo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wells Fargo. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.1% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Wells Fargo &amp; Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$102m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

This effort is separate from the Fed’s annual bank stress tests.Six of the largest US banks — Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) — are being asked to assess the impact of everything from hurricanes and wildfires to heatwaves and higher average temperatures on residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios over the next year. The Fed calls these ""physical risk scenarios.""Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve member Chris Waller, speaks during a conversations with leaders from organizations that include nonprofits, small businesses, manufacturing, supply chain management, the hospitality industry, and the housing and education sectors at the Federal Reserve building, Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed is also asking banks to evaluate the impact of stresses from the transitioning to a lower carbon economy on corporate and commercial real estate loan portfolios over a 10-year horizon.Waller said Thursday that he does think it’s important to continue doing academic research regarding the role that climate plays in economic outcomes. But he said he doesn't believe risks posed by climate change merit special treatment from the Fed.Falling property values tied to physical climate risks like hurricanes and fires could result in losses for banks, he said, but ""there is a growing body of literature that suggests economic agents are already adjusting behavior to account for risks associated with climate change.""Story continuesWaller said the Fed already tests for severe declines in real estate values in its annual stress tests.In last year's stress test, which envisioned a drop of more than 25% in real estate values, the largest banks were able to absorb nearly $100 billion in losses on loans collateralized by real estate, in addition to another half a trillion dollars of losses on other positions, says Waller.“Based on what I've seen so far, I believe that placing an outsized focus on climate-related risks is not needed, and the Federal Reserve should focus on more near-term and material risks in keeping with our mandate.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Given the prevailing economic conditions, a market-neutral fund is particularly relevant for protecting one’s invested capital. This type of fund is designed to provide stable returns at relatively lower levels of risk regardless of market direction. Market-neutral funds aim to adopt a precision approach by shorting 50% of their assets and holding 50% long. This method seeks to identify pairs of assets whose price movements are related. The fund goes long on the outperforming asset and shorts the underperformer. Say, for instance, you take a $1 million long position in Pfizer and a $1 million short position in Wyeth, both large pharmaceutical companies. If pharmaceutical stocks fall, you will lose because of your long position in Pfizer but gain from your short position in Wyeth. Below, we share with you three top-ranked market-neutral funds, viz., Hussman Strategic Growth Fund HSGFX, BlackRock Event Driven Equity Fund BALPX and Calamos Market Neutral Income Fund CVSIX. Each has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is expected to outperform its peers in the future. Investors can click here to see the complete list of market-neutral funds.  Hussman Strategic Growth Fund typically invests most of its assets in common stocks recommended by its investment advisors. HSGFX may employ options and index futures, and other hedging strategies, to balance the fund’s exposure during unfavorable market conditions. Hussman Strategic Growth Fund has three-year annualized returns of 4.6%. HSGFX has an expense ratio of 1.13% compared with the category average of 1.92%. BlackRock Event Driven Equity Fund invests in equity securities, derivative instruments, and depositary receipts. BALPX chooses to invest in event-driven strategies, especially in companies that have announced a material change. BlackRock Event Driven Equity Fund has a three-year annualized return of 3.1%. Mark McKenna has been one of the fund managers of BALPX since 2015.Story continues Calamos Market Neutral Income Fund seeks to achieve high current income by investing in equities, convertible securities of U.S. companies irrespective of their market capitalization and options and high-yield, fixed-income securities. CVSIX advisors also use short selling and swap to enhance income and hedge against market risk. Calamos Market Neutral Income Fund has a three-year annualized return of 3.2%.

It is price setting,"" Bourla said at a Reuters newsmaker event on Thursday, referring to the Biden Administration’s signature drug pricing reform, part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The law aims to save $25 billion through price negotiations by 2031 for Americans who pay more for medicines than any other country.The pharmaceutical industry says the law, passed last year, will result in a loss of profits that will force drugmakers to pull back on developing groundbreaking new treatments.The companies have begun laying the groundwork to fight the U.S. plan, Reuters reported earlier this week.""I think that there will be legal action,"" he said, adding that he was not sure if that would stop the plan before new prices would go into effect in 2026. Bourla said he is also not optimistic that Congress will act to change the law.Drugs likely to be among the first subject to negotiation include Pfizer's breast cancer treatment Ibrance and the blood thinner Eliquis, which Pfizer shares with Bristol Myers Squibb.Bourla did acknowledge some positive aspects of the law for patients, such as lower out-of-pocket costs for medicines.A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which will oversee the drug price talks, said in an emailed statement: ""We have been regularly engaging with interested parties, including manufacturers, health plans, and patient groups, to gather input and feedback throughout implementation.""After considering the comments it receives, the agency said it ""will issue revised guidance in the summer of 2023.”Bourla is looking to shift Pfizer's focus from the COVID-19 vaccines and treatment that put the company at the forefront of the pandemic response and led to a once-in-a-lifetime surge in revenue.Story continuesThe company is in the midst of a steep but expected fall in COVID product sales and is also preparing for declining revenue in coming years for some of its top-selling drugs as they begin to face competition from cheap generics.As a result, investors are looking for Pfizer to produce new blockbuster drugs that can pull in billions every year, either from the company's own pipeline of medicines in development or through deals.Bourla led Pfizer as the New York-based drugmaker raced alongside German partner BioNTech to develop a vaccine for COVID as much of the world locked down in 2020. The company also developed Paxlovid, a life-saving antiviral treatment for the disease.The COVID products drove Pfizer's revenue to record levels, topping $100 billion in 2022 and $80 billion in 2021.""Pfizer is giving all the profits that we made from COVID in '21 and '22 and what we will make in '23 to acquire technology and products that we believe will allow us to battle cancer,"" he said, calling the effort the drugmaker's ""next moonshot.""'NOT ABOUT ABORTION PILLS'Bourla has overseen a string of acquisitions to bolster Pfizer's drug pipeline, headlined by the $43 billion deal for Seagen, which makes complex targeted cancer therapies.The drugmaker also spent billions on its purchases of migraine drugmaker Biohaven Pharmaceutical, ulcerative colitis drug developer Arena Pharmaceuticals, and Global Blood Therapeutics, maker of a sickle cell disease treatment.Bourla said he anticipates only doing modestly-sized deals in the near-term as he concentrates on the Seagen integration.As the company works to develop new drugs, Bourla raised concerns about a recent ruling by a judge in Texas that suspended abortion pill mifepristone's 2000 approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. Supreme Court put that order on hold, leaving the drug used in more than half of U.S. abortions on the market while the case is appealed.Bourla signed an open letter by hundreds industry executives calling on the Supreme Court to reverse the Texas judge's decision. On Thursday, he called the FDA ""the most iconic regulatory body in the world,"" and said citizens can trust that the regulators have done the work to confirm whether drugs are safe.""This is not about abortion pills... It has to do with the ability of a judge to say whether a medicine is safe and effective,"" Bourla said. ""That undermines the whole system of trust.""(Reporting by Michael Erman in New York and Bhanvi Stija in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Given the segment operating income beat and narrowing of DTC losses, we would not be surprised if shares traded modestly higher tomorrow.Goldman Sachs cut the price target to $130 per share, from the prior $136, but remains Buy-rated on DIS stock:Our key positive takeaway from DIS’s F2Q23 results is that we believe management is showing solid execution against key profitability initiatives outlined last quarter... Our key negative takeaway is that DIS continues to confront both secular and cyclical headwinds, which may yield lumpy operating trends including during 2H.Airbnb warns of slowing growthAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) said it made $0.18 a share - a swing from last year's loss but also $0.02 shy of Street expectations - on in-line revenue of $1.8 billion. The company also announced a new share buyback program of up to $2.5B.Looking ahead to Q2, the company guided revenue in a range of $2.35B to $2.45B, in line with Wall Street estimates, but also said Night and Experiences Booked ""will have unfavorable year-over-year comparisons in Q2 2023 as we overlap pent-up 2022 demand following the COVID Omicron variant.""After that, the shares took a quick fall. Morgan Stanley cut the price target to $95 per share and reiterated an Underweight rating on ABNB stock, as InvestingPro reported in real time:Story continuesSlower-than-expected forward room night growth (US facing pricing and supply constraints) speak to how forward growth (more reliant on Europe, APAC, LATAM and new business opportunities) could face higher execution risk.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy.As the global information technology revolution heats up and more and more companies embrace Cloud computing, AI, digital marketing, automation and web technologies for their business, the information technology services sector stands to benefit in the years to come. Bloomberg Intelligence in a survey of 3,038 executives across different industries found that businesses, small and large, are expected to keep increasing their IT spend as they plan to stay ahead in the technology race. A whopping 61% of respondents in the survey said that they plan to increase their tech spending.One of the biggest areas where companies plan to increase their spending is cybersecurity as companies resolve to protect their online assets and customer data. Because of this trend, as we will see later in the article, several small and big IT services companies have started offering cybersecurity services.Another important area where companies are planning to pour their dollars is Cloud computing, where Amazon and Microsoft will continue to take the lead, according to the survey. But in addition to these Cloud giants, several IT services companies thrive because of the Cloud industry as they help businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to Cloud systems and maintain their operations. Some notable companies in this domain are ServiceNow, Oracle and DXC.While companies are poised to increase IT spending, the sector wasn’t immune to the inflation surge and global economic crisis that wreaked havoc on the markets in 2022 and continue to hammer small and large companies in 2023. Gartner earlier this year estimated that worldwide IT spending will reach $4.5 trillion in 2023. This shows a 2.4% growth from the previous year, but was down from Gartner’s previous growth projections of 5.1%.Story continuesSpending on business software and IT was expected to account for a whopping $2.16 trillion in projected IT spending in 2023, according to Gartner. This shows that importance of IT services. Despite difficult odds companies need IT services to scale and expand their operations and even to cut costs.Consulting is another area that is thriving withing the IT services industry. The Gartner report says within IT services, spending on consulting services was expected to reach $264 billion this year, up 6.7% from 2022.Gartner said that inflation was eroding the spending capabilities of companies and causing layoffs at several B2C companies.The Gartner report shows that companies are expected to spend more on software and IT and reduce spend dollars when it comes to devices and hardware. The software and IT services segments are expected to grow 9.3% and 5.5% in 2023, respectively, according to Gartner.Given all the hullaballoo around AI, IT services companies are not silent about this new trend. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet in the company’s earnings call with analysts in March talked about Accenture’s AI initiatives:“We are continuing to use AI in the way we run our business, for example, in how we look at our accounts payable and receivables and finding ways where we can optimize to have better efficiencies there. We are using it today in the way we are delivering our consulting services as well and definitely very much so in how we look at sales and being able to predict based on lots of factors. Should we be running after the sale or not, or can we show the data that these …. is not the right kind of sale, we are not the right fit. So, we have increasingly been using AI, both in how we deliver services as well as in how we run ourselves.Of course, our SynOps platform for operations is also AI-enabled. It’s one of the reasons why clients turn to us because it’s helping them digitize faster. They are not having to build these things. So, long-term, we see these technology changes, things like generative AI is playing to our strengths because to use these technologies, it requires deep understanding of the industry, the use cases, the process changes. When people talk about the new kinds of generative AI, which we are super excited about, being like a co-pilot to human beings, the entire process has to be changed in order to make that work. You have got to up-skill the people and you have to be able to do all of that in a very responsible way.""Photo by Science in HD on UnsplashMethodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 12 IT services stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy12.

However, the bottom line significantly decreased from the year-ago quarter’s $2.32 per unit. Total quarterly revenues of $5,362 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,516 million. The top line also declined from $5,402 million a year ago.Better-than-expected quarterly earnings were primarily driven by higher contributions from the Fuel Distribution and Marketing segment.

First-quarter earnings-related updates were discussed in the previous write-up as well.Driven by the buoyant passenger-volume scenario, another Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL reported rosy traffic numbers for the month of February. European carrier, Ryanair Holdings’ RYAAY April traffic report was impressive as well.  An update on fleet modernization was also available from Ryanair. Meanwhile, United Airlines UAL expanded its code-sharing agreement with Azul AZUL in a customer-friendly move.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 Copa Holdings’ first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.99 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 and rose more than 100% year over year. Revenues of $867.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.1 million and improved 51.7% year over year on the back of passenger revenues.Passenger revenues (contributed 96.2% to the top line) increased 28.5% from first-quarter 2019 levels, owing to higher yields (up 20%). Cargo and mail revenues jumped 51.8% from first-quarter 2019 actuals to $23.25 million, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Other operating revenues improved 24% to $10 million, owing to revenues from non-air ConnectMiles partners.For 2023, CPA, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), expects consolidated capacity to grow in the 12-13% band from 2022 actuals. CPA expects the current-year operating margin to be between 22% and 24%. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is expected to be approximately 85%. Fuel price per gallon of $2.85 is expected for the current year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here2. United Airlines widened the scope of its code-sharing partnership with Azul. Under the expanded deal, passengers can fly to six new destinations after connecting from the designated Brazilian airports to Orlando or Fort Lauderdale on UAL flights. The six new destinations are Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, San Francisco, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. The customer-friendly move will allow them to travel using a single ticket for both UAL and Azul-operated flights. From May 10, passengers will be able to make easy one-stop connections to the above destinations with a single ticket. The expanded partnership between the two airline companies was built on their existing codeshare routes from Houston and Newark.Story continues3. Ryanair placed a huge order for 150 new 737 MAX-10 planes from Boeing. These planes, expected to be delivered between 2027 and 2033, will reportedly replace the aging 737 jets in the airline’s fleet.On a separate note, 16 million passengers were ferried on RYAAY flights in April. This compared favorably with the March figure of 12.6 million and the year-ago number of 14.2 million. Owing to the upbeat traffic, load factor was as high as 94% in April compared with 91% a year ago.4. For April, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) at Gol Linhas increased 13.6% year over year. To match the upbeat demand situation, the company is simultaneously expanding its capacity (measured in available seat kilometers). During the same month, capacity grew 12.5% year over year. GOL carried 19% more passengers in April compared with the year-ago figure. Consolidated load factor improved to 78.9% in April from 78.2% a year ago.Domestic departures, which accounted for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 17.8% on a year-over-year basis.

188,4ec02116-08ee-3777-9123-07a8dfa3e149,UAL,2023-05-12,United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-holdings-inc-ual-130001314.html,1683810001,STORY,['UAL'],"[United Airlines (UAL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this airline have returned +9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, to which United belongs, has gained 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.United is expected to post earnings of $3.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +157.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.07 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +259.9%. This estimate has changed +12.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.31 indicates a change of +13.7% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for United.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $13.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15%. The $53.03 billion and $55.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and +5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $11.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.1%. EPS of -$0.63 for the same period compares with -$4.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was +13.7%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

189,bc3437eb-7731-3e16-8c63-ae2f3198c40d,PNC,2023-05-12,"Courage, Key Resources Yield Optimism Among Minority Business Owners",ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/courage-key-resources-yield-optimism-150000223.html,1683817200,STORY,['PNC'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 11, 2023 / The PNC Financial Services GroupThe PNC Financial Services Group, Thursday, May 11, 2023, Press release picturePNC | InsightsBy Marshalynn OdnealDuring the first three months of the pandemic, 41% of black-owned businesses and 32% of Hispanic-owned businesses closed across the country. By contrast, only 17% of white-owned businesses shut their doors, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Despite this reality and even as minority business owners face current economic challenges, including supply chain disruptions and inflation, results from PNC's recent Economic Outlook survey show an impressive resiliency and positive mindset among these business leaders.According to the survey, more than two-thirds (68%) of minority business owners feel highly optimistic about the prospects of their own company in the next six months, compared to just 60% of non-minority-owned businesses. And while both business owner groups remain cautious about the national economy, the gap between optimism among minority business owners for their own company versus the broader U.S. economy is 40 percentage points, significantly higher than 31-point difference among non-minority owners.I have no doubt that minority business owners who were able to manage the world health crisis had to make unprecedented decisions related to staffing, business models and pricing. In doing so, they faced a Goliath - and won. It's unsurprising that their mindset about the future of their businesses, despite current economic challenges, is optimistic.All of this is just the tip of the iceberg. According to our survey, 65% of black- and Hispanic-owned business owners stated they have a business plan suited to the current direction of the economy, significantly more than non-minority owned businesses (55%). This highlights the importance of access to crucial resources for these business owners. The survey reinforces this point, showing that 86% of black- and Hispanic-owned businesses interacted with or leveraged resources from the Small Business Association (SBA), a local chamber of commerce or a community economic development organization. Only 69% of non-minority business owners reported doing the same.Story continuesThe truth is that the unique financial challenges minority-owned businesses have long faced were amplified during the pandemic. As a result, more minority business owners are now seeking Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) certification, which is also an important and needed resource.Businesses that become MBE certified, gain exclusive access to premium networking events, affordable consulting services, and technology programs, among other benefits, according to the National Minority Supplier Development Council. Our survey revealed that nearly nine out of 10 (87%) black-owned businesses are now MBE-certified, up from seven out of 10 (69%) last year. Three-quarters (75%) of Hispanic-owned business are MBE-certified, compared to two-thirds (67%) last year. Of MBE-certified businesses, a majority of black- (80%) and Hispanic-owned (84%) businesses said that certification has been a helpful business development tool.PNC has taken significant steps in doing more for minority-owned businesses and providing necessary resources to help them overcome roadblocks. As a part of our Small Business organization, PNC's Minority Business Development (MBD) Group's mission is to deliver solutions and resources that foster financial wellness for small businesses within our diverse communities. We've been able to do this, in part, through our PNC-Certified Minority Business Advocate initiative, a voluntary advocacy program that helps PNC employees understand the challenges facing minority-owned businesses and how to guide minority entrepreneurs to the appropriate resource.Optimism among these business owners, combined with access to financial, educational, and other useful resources, can position these entrepreneurs for scale and growth in the long-term.If their optimism is realized and the U.S. business landscape prospers further down the road, minority business supporters must continue to execute against their mission and accelerate their efforts. The outlook is bright, but we must continue to do our part to advocate for these entrepreneurs and help their communities thrive.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/754275/Courage-Key-Resources-Yield-Optimism-Among-Minority-Business-Owners]"

The big-box retailer has been thriving. In Q4 2022, the company reported that its total revenue of $31.4 billion grew 1.3% — a bump that was driven by sales growth of 1.2% and an 8.4% increase in other revenue.Here: 8 Companies Behind Costco’s Kirkland Brand ProductsMore: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchThough Target appears to be having no problem staying popular, it also has no shortage of competition, with giants like Amazon and Walmart looming over its shoulder. Thus, it’s helpful for consumers to know for what items Target is the best place to shop. GOBankingRates consulted Target superfans to get the scoop on their favorite Target purchases of all time.Crayola CrayonsThose who color or have young kids can appreciate Target’s offers on Crayola crayons.“For instance, their 48-count Washable Sidewalk Chalk is only $5.29 in stores and is currently only $4.49 when purchased online,” said Liza Kirsh, chief marketing officer of Dymapak. “Amazon for example sells a 36-count box for $19.86, so you’ll receive huge savings by purchasing from Target. Even Walmart sells the 48ct for $15.99. With summer coming fast, stock up on fun, quality sidewalk chalk at Target for a great price. “Men’ TeesMens clothing at Target is high-quality and often cheaper than what other retailers sell similar products for.“The average men’s shirt at Target is around $30, whereas anywhere else with comparable quality would be closer to $45,” said James Green, owner of  Build A Head. Right now, you can actually find men’s tees for as low as $6 at Target.Dollar Tree: 12 High-Quality Items To Buy in MayDesigner ClothingYou can find plenty of Target brand clothing at the store, naturally, but did you know you can also find (on occasion) designer duds at the bullseye retailer? This is because Target regularly collaborates with top-notch designers to create exclusive collections.Story continues“Target has been stepping up its fashion game in recent years, offering trendy and affordable clothing options for men, women and children,” said Eva Decker, the marketing director of Idigic. “I recommend checking out Target’s collaborations with designers like Hunter and Victoria Beckham, which offer high-end style at a fraction of the cost.”Good &amp; Gather Pumpkin Pie SpiceWho says pumpkin spice has to exclusively be the flavor of fall? Why not summer, too? At Target you can have it anytime.“Target has its solid house brand’s version for $1.99 for a 1.7-oz container,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com, who adds that buying Target’s great version of this spice is easier than making your own.Good &amp; Gather Creamy Peanut ButterPretty much every retailer that sells groceries sells peanut butter. But is it as good and affordable as Target’s offering?“A 40-oz jar of this snack is $4.79 and whether I’m baking with it or just using it as an accompaniment to apple slices or graham crackers, 11 cents per ounce is an excellent value. Even the smaller containers work out to about 12 cents per ounce, so if I feel like I need less I don’t mind buying the 16-oz size jar of this pantry staple either,” said Ramhold.Good &amp; Gather Hot Cocoa MixAgain, more of a cold weather-related item, but still good to know about Target’s scrumptious Good &amp; Gather Hot Cocoa Mix, which sells for $6.49 per box.“This stuff is so good and has been a regular purchase of mine since I discovered it,” Ramhold said. “There are some flavors that are available year-round including Double Chocolate, Peppermint, Cinnamon, and Sea Salt Caramel and they’re all delicious. Honestly they’re in my pantry year-round.”Silicone Clip-On Pan StrainerTiffany Payne, head of content at PharmacyOnline, swears by this $8 clip-on strainer for pots, noting that it makes cooking simpler.“You can add it to any vessel to strain the water without having to clear out the sink to use a traditional strainer,” Payne said. “As it is made of silicone, it is also simple to sanitize.”Costway 6-Burner Propane Gas BBQ Grill With Side Burner‘Tis nearly the season for outdoor grilling. If you’re not already situated with grilling gear, you may want to check out this 6-burner propane gas BBQ grill for $324.99.“As a person who recently moved to a new house with a big garden, I was looking for a big grill that could provide my family and friends with a BBQ on summer afternoons. I saw the model on the site of a Target competitor, and the price was $499,” said Milosz Krasinski, managing director at Chilli Fruit. “When I checked the Target website, I was shocked and needed to check if that’s the same grill for sure. Target offers it for $324.99, which is 40% less than at the competitors.”Stars Above PajamasWalmart, Costco and other mega retailers sell pajamas, but are they just that perfect level of soft and attractiveness? Because that really matters.“Hands down these are the most comfortable items of clothing I’ve found at Target, and despite the fact that they fall under pajamas, I wear these things whenever,” Ramhold said. “Their joggers are around $20 a pair but they are so comfortable I’ve purchased multiple pairs and tend to wear them practically every day. The pants are also about $20 and the shorts are anywhere from $13-$14 per pair depending on the material. I highly recommend these if you’re interested in comfortable pajamas or loungewear but also want to look cute.”More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Target’s 9 Best Buys, According to Superfans]"

Yet even as the Federal Reserve suggests that interest rate cuts will not happen this year, and economic growth continues to slow, now may actually be a perfect time to search for REITs with high returns.Well, high potential returns, to be exact. While nothing is for certain, in hindsight diving into REITs could prove to be a profitable move. Since the Fed began to hike rates in 2022 to curb inflation, REITs, high-quality and low-quality alike, have been hammered to lower prices.However, these elevated interest rates are not permanent. As inflation continues to cool, the Fed will reverse course on its current monetary policy. Lower rates will help this sector make a recovery. That’s not all. Beyond just a rebound out of the current slumps, when it comes to REITs and long-term investing, there are plenty of names with strong yield and appreciation potential. A good example is with these seven. Each of these top REITs to buy has the potential to become REITs with high returns over a long time frame.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAIRCApartment Income REIT$36.03BXPBoston Properties$51.93IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$69.36NNNNNN. REIT$44.44OFCCorporate Office Properties$24.46PLDPrologis$127.25WPCW.P. Carey$73.24Apartment Income REIT (AIRC)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockApartment Income REIT (NYSE:AIRC) focuses on buying and managing multifamily properties. This REIT owns 75 apartment communities, across the United States. So, what makes AIRC stock one of the best REITs to buy now? For starters, Apartment Income REIT trades at a discount to peers. AIRC’s price-to-funds from operations (or P/FFO) ratio, the REIT equivalent of an earnings multiple, is 15.4. By comparison, names like AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) and Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) trade for P/FFO ratios in the 17-18 range.Story continuesAIRC also has a forward yield of 5.05%, versus 3.71% for AVB and 4.25%. However, it’s not as if relative value is the only factor that makes this apartment REIT a buy. As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, AIRC’s strategy of selling lower-return properties to buy higher-return properties leaves it poised to deliver income and capital growth to investors.Boston Properties (BXP)two women working on laptops in office space with black PPE face masks onSource: Halfpoint/shutterstock.comAre you a contrarian about the future of office buildings? Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) may be the right REIT for your portfolio. In the past, BXP has been considered one of the blue chip REITs, thanks to its portfolio of Class A office properties in top-tier U.S. metro areas. However, as remote and hybrid working trends have persisted, office REITs have cratered, and remain at depressed prices. This of course makes names like BXP stock risky, yet at the same, this uncertainty could mean big opportunity.Trading at a P/FFO of just 6.8, and with a forward yield of 7.8%, BXP has a lot to gain, if interest rates move lower, and if the labor market normalizes (giving employers more bargaining power for “return to office” mandates). Such a turn of events could make Boston Properties one of the REITS with high returns.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Cannabis leaf on dollar bill. Cannabis StocksSource: ShutterstockSpeaking of risky REITs, Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) is another such example. Don’t let the name fool you. Rather than owning a portfolio of industrial parks, IIPR owns and leases out properties to state-licensed cannabis growers. As I have argued previously, IIPR stock is one of the best cannabis stocks out there. This is due to its hefty dividend yield (10.6%), low valuation (P/FFO of 9.3), and exposure to the legalized cannabis trend. Admittedly though, there is a reason for its deep value status.IIPR’s rent collection rate has been declining, suggesting that its high yield is under threat. However, as I have argued before, IIPR is making efforts to mitigate this issue, including further diversification of its tenant base. If you’re risk-tolerant, and have conducted the proper REIT analysis of this name, IIPR is definitely a real estate investment trust to consider.NNN REIT (NNN)Commercial shopping center in a tropical climateSource: mTaira / Shutterstock.comFormerly known as National Retail Properties, NNN REIT (NYSE:NNN), is, as its name suggests, a REIT focused on properties leased out on a triple-net basis. In other words, NNN collects a base rent from tenants, who are responsible for occupancy costs such as insurance, maintenance, and real estate taxes.NNN stock is similar to its better-known peer Realty Income (NYSE:O) when it comes to dividends. Both names sport forward yield of just under 5%. NNN and O both have decades-long history of slow-and-steady dividend growth. However, this triple-net lease REIT has the edge, when it comes to valuation. NNN trades at a P/FFO ratio of 14, whereas O trades at a P/FFO ratio of 15.4. This may sound like a case of splitting hairs, but if you’re looking to add triple-net exposure to your portfolio, NNN may just well be the better choice.Corporate Office Properties (OFC)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockCompared to most office REITs, Corporate Office Properties (NYSE:OFC) appears to be much better-positioned to ride out the current slump in office space demand. Why? As I argued last month, it has to do with this REIT’s tenant base.That is, Corporate Office Properties Trust focused on owning/leasing out properties used by the U.S. Federal Government, as well as defense contractors. These types of properties may be more immune to work-from-home trends. Security requirements make it impossible for sensitive types of governmental work to be conducted fully remote.There’s also been a growing push to bring federal workers back into the office. The market isn’t fully aware of these strengths, yet one they catch on, it could turn OFC stock, which is undervalued at a P/FFO ratio of 9.6, and a dividend yield of 4.7%  into one of the REITs with high returns.Prologis (PLD)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comInvestors looking for exposure to not just U.S. industrial real estate, but global industrial real estate, should consider owning Prologis (NYSE:PLD). This REIT is one of the world’s largest owners of logistics real estate such as warehouses. When it comes to REITs and long-term investing, PLD stock is a strong choice. While shares may trade at a premium valuation (P/FFO of 24.5) compared to most REITs, and offer a forward yield of just 2.79%, Prologis’ growth prospects may more than make up for it. Although other types of real estate have experienced headwinds lately, industrial real estate demand remains robust.Prologis recently raised its outlook due to these positive trends. Beyond organic growth, management continues to pursue valuation creation efforts like the acquisition/development of new properties. All of this could fuel strong price appreciation for PLD in the years ahead.W.P. Carey (WPC)hand of person in a suit dangling keys with a house symbol on the ring. Windows overlooking city skyline in background.Source: ImageFlow/shutterstock.comW.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) is another of the large triple-net lease REITs. However, unlike NNN REIT or Realty Income, WPC has a more broad base of single-tenant real estate assets. Rather than focusing on just retail triple-net lease properties, the REIT owns a mix of office, retail, and industrial real estate.WPC is also a specialist in sale/leaseback transactions. While NNN and O may themselves be strong investment opportunities, WPC stock could be a stronger candidate when it comes to REITs with high returns. Not only does WPC trade at an lower multiple (12.3) than these other net lease names. W.P. Carey also has a higher forward dividend yield, nearing 6%. At the same time, as Sure Dividend’s Bob Ciura has argued, WPC’s diversified, recession-resistant assets, with build-in rent increases tied to CPI, give it strong potential to generate “lucrative total returns over the long term.”On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Scott?Story continuesScott Thomas FordGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Clay. It's good to be here with you all today. I'm pleased to be able to share a quick word on our first quarter operating results, update you on the 2 most important areas of focus for our team in '23 and share my views on our progress towards achieving the strategic goals we laid out when we went public last summer.As noted in the headline of our release, net sales for the first quarter increased 10% year-over-year on a consolidated basis and 22% in our Beverage Solutions segment. The most significant contributors being the 44% increase in our single-serve cup volumes and the flow-through of last year's coffee price rise. Clearly, we continue to work through scaling up the single-serve and extract units as capacity constraints, new physical expansions and the resulting operating efficiency challenges impacted our EBITDA pull-through in the first quarter. Thankfully, these pressures are beginning to wane as we brought additional manufacturing, single-serve capacity online late in Q1, and we are turning on our new extract expansion in North Carolina over the next few weeks.Turning to our 2 key business priorities for '23. First, our team remains focused on successfully launching our new extract and ready-to-drink facility in Conway, Arkansas. I'm pleased we remain on track with this project with anticipated product launches beginning in the first quarter of '24, rolling through a ramp-up over the remainder of the year. In addition to the timely launch of the Conway facility, the second topic the team is constantly aware of is the available revenues, cost and margins of our core coffee and tea business. So amidst the excitement of growth, new customer relationships, new product launches, we remain ever vigilant on our price points, costs, operating metrics, efficiencies and returns as this is a competitive commodity processing business.Our single-serve scale-up effort has been tremendously challenging due largely to equipment shortages. But we are now meeting those challenges as new machines are online and our in-stock levels are now back at industry-leading standards. The flavors extracts and ingredients business continues to show itself as both a tremendous source of growth and is a powerful generator of leads for all of our product lines. And the Conway extract and RTD facility continues on pace with ever growing interest from an even broader customer base than we envisioned when we set out on this path.With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris, and then I'll give a quick wrap up, and he and I will be glad to answer your questions. Chris?Thomas Christopher PledgerThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone.I'll begin my remarks with an overview of our first quarter results, and then I'll provide an update on our 2023 outlook. As we stated from our very first earnings call, we measure our financial success based on adjusted EBITDA on both an absolute dollar basis and on our growth rate compared to prior periods. And in the first quarter of 2023, our consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $8.5 million, a decrease of approximately $2.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. There are 3 main factors driving these results. First, as mentioned on our last quarterly call, it has taken us longer and cost more in terms of equipment, labor and materials to absorb the 44% year-over-year growth in our single-serve cup volumes. That said, our single-serve production received a major boost in the first quarter when we installed and commercialized new single-serve cup machines in February and March. With the addition of these machines, we have been able to improve our customer service levels and turn our focus to delivering the efficiency improvements that come from being able to optimize our single-serve platform. While we do not expect immediate earnings growth from our single-serve operations in the second quarter, we remain optimistic that we should be able to drive improved financial performance from this platform over the back half of the year.In addition to the single-serve equipment installations in our Little Rock, Arkansas facility, at the beginning of the first quarter, we transitioned our North Carolina facilities from the legacy and might I say antiquated ERP system on to the modern and cloud-based platform we utilize for all of our other Westrock Coffee operations. This brings our entire company onto a common ERP platform that we will leverage as we expand. As a result of the conversion, our [resting grounds] manufacturing operation was offline for approximately 2 weeks in early January. That downtime, coupled with a gradual ramp back up to full production negatively impacted our service levels for our roast and ground coffee in January and February. The good news is that our ERP system, along with the manufacturing operations tied to it in North Carolina are running now as they should.Scott Thomas FordThe net impact of the conversion downtime as well as the challenges scaling our single-serve platform account for approximately $4 million in missed gross profit in the quarter, which flows down dollar per dollar to adjusted EBITDA. Finally, our sustainable sourcing and traceability segment, or SS&amp;T, experienced a 36% decline in net sales in the first quarter of 2022. As the disruption in global supply chains brought about by the COVID pandemic normalizes and coffee roasters roast through their stockpile buffer stocks, we are not surprised to see a reduction in sales volume as SS&amp;T customers normalize their coffee inventory levels. We expect to continue to see this trend through at least the next quarter.With that in mind, let's walk through the financial results.Thomas Christopher PledgerTotal company net sales for the first quarter increased 10% year-over-year to $205.4 million. Our sales growth was driven by the 44% increase in single-serve cup volumes referenced earlier and increased pricing for the pass-through of higher underlying green coffee prices during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 3% decrease in roast and ground coffee volumes and the 36% decrease in net sales in our SS&amp;T segment.Gross profit, excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, decreased $4.2 million to $33.1 million due in part to higher material and production labor costs compared to the prior year quarter, the negative impacts of the production stoppage as part of the ERP conversion and our continued efforts to absorb the 44% growth in year-over-year single-serve cup volume. These impacts on our gross profit had a flow-through effect on our consolidated adjusted EBITDA, which as mentioned above, was $8.5 million for the first quarter.On a segment basis, our Beverage Solutions segment contributed $181.2 million of net sales for the first quarter of 2023, which represents year-over-year growth of 22%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $8.4 million compared to $10.4 million for the prior year first quarter.Turning to our SS&amp;T segment. Sales net of intersegment revenues were $24.2 million during the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of 36% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was breakeven compared to approximately $1 million for the prior year first quarter.With respect to our capital expenditures, during the first quarter, we deployed approximately $20 million in CapEx, the majority of which was growth capital related to our Conway extract and RTD facility. These expenditures primarily consisted of infrastructure spending and equipment payments for our glass and can lines. In addition, we deployed $3 million of gross CapEx tied to the continued single-serve capacity expansion in our Little Rock, Arkansas facility. In the first quarter of 2023, we added new single-serve machines, and we expect to add additional machines in the coming quarters, which should allow us to be able to capitalize on increased customer demand while also improving the overall efficiency of our single-serve cup operations.At the quarter end, we had approximately $144 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio as of March 31 was 4.3x based on LTM adjusted EBITDA. We believe we have ample access to liquidity to achieve our near-term growth targets and capital expenditure needs.Despite the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 10% and 25% for the year, which translates to a range of USD66 million to USD75 million in adjusted EBITDA. This guidance represents our current expectations regarding the performance of the business. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.With that in mind, I'll hand the call back over to Scott for some closing comments.Scott Thomas FordThanks, Chris. In closing today, I'd like to offer a word on our strategic progress. As when we went public last year, our vision, simply stated, is to achieve the attractive economics available to a scaled player serving the largest and most complex retail restaurant and CPG customers in the world of coffee and to do that in a way that fosters fair market pricing all the way through the supply chain to our farmer partners in 35 origin countries. I remain very excited about not only what we are building and the ultimate value that we create for all of us, collectively, but also about our meaningful progress along that journey at this point in time.With that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuSo I want to start on a comment that you made, Scott, just as it relates to bigger picture demand and the breadth of that demand being larger than you originally conceived, as you continue to make progress on scaling up Conway, can you talk about how demand continues to shape up in conversations with either existing or prospective customers?Scott Thomas FordYes, sure. We've given some general framework around percentages of the facility, and we will do a full update we're thinking at the end of the third quarter as we wrap kind of the main contracts that are going to go into Conway that will be up and running in early '24. But essentially, we're turning on a large glass line. It is sold out, and we have a waiting list. We're turning on a large retorque canning line, and it is well over 50% sold out. We're turning on a multiserve bottle line, and actually we have been running a line like it in Kohana, and we are having to up the size of that line sevenfold to be able to make room for the demand that we've got coming in. We have demand for other product lines that are not in the Phase 1 and 2 that we're turning on in Conway. And that is actually where we're spending a lot of our time with customers right now. Now that the first 3 lines are, for the most part, spoken for, what are the fourth and fifth lines will turn on, and we're literally negotiating contracts with people for those at this current point in time.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. That's great. Maybe with respect to kind of the continued situation where demand continues to exceed your ability to supply it and thinking about in addition to the organic growth plans that you have, some of the M&amp;A that you've done, I'd be curious to hear about your continued appetite for M&amp;A to help meet the demand that's coming or bring additional capabilities to the organization. And then when you think about kind of interest rate environments and perhaps a tighter banking system that we've seen develop over the course of the year, year-to-date. How has that impacted, how fertile the landscape is for M&amp;A and potentially asking prices that you see out in the market?Scott Thomas FordWell, Ben, that is one complicated question. So let me unpack it this way. we are in, in the multiserve bottle single-serve ready-to-drink can and glass bottle. That is a very interesting industry structure right now. There are a number of really good players that are in that space. It wouldn't surprise me over time if there was some form of consolidation in it. But at this point in time, and this is to the second part of your question, we are head down focused on making sure we deliver what we signed up to deliver. We are constantly aware as anybody would be of the current market, the banking climate where we are in terms of cushion that we've got available to us in terms of our own capitalization, how much our customers are asking us to buy it off versus how much we can comfortably buy it off with the capital structure that we've got. And we're going back and forth through that with our Board with our key shareholder partners that are on the Board and also with our customers because what's really clear is there is a service and a set of products that we are maybe not uniquely, but we are certainly distinctly qualified to provide that the major CPG retail brands in the country are looking to buy a lot more of than they can get their hands on today. And we want to be the first and last call that they make to meet those needs. How that plays through the industry over time is beyond my pay grade on today's first quarter call. But you're asking the right questions. And if I look at the history of this team, we will probably be a player in that space at the right time. But right now, the time is to make sure we execute and deliver against what our customers are lined up for.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. Very good. And one more, if I could, quickly on the shorter term, just for this year's guidance, good to see that reiterated. I know it's a milestone on the way to continued ramp in EBITDA as we move forward. I want to ask about the $4 million impact to net profit in the quarter. Was that contemplated in the prior guidance range? And if not, is there something about the remainder of the year that makes you more optimistic such that you maintain your guidance for 2023?Scott Thomas FordYes. And Chris will actually take you through the guidance. But let me own something here broadly. So Chris talked about the fact that our roast and ground operations in North Carolina were down for 2 weeks. We did not plan on that. That was not in our guidance. That was a few million dollars of the miss in the overall grand scheme of things. And the only person responsible for that is me. We had a series of mock conversions that were perfect all through the fall. We had every anticipation we would be able to do that exchange, the conversion in 3 to 4 days. We had 2 customers who had an emergency that needed supplies that they couldn't get from another vendor. And I made the decision to front run the conversion, and I made a mistake in doing that, and I cost us the downtime, I cost us the EBITDA from the missed sales and the cleanup, and it's not the IT department's fault. It wasn't the accounting department's fault. It wasn't the operations team's fault. It was mine. And so that's the majority of the miss. The good news, as Chris said, that is behind us. The team did a miraculous job of digging out of that. That system is up and running and puts us in a place to go forward rapidly with all of the issues that are attendant to the first question you asked over the next couple of years. and we really ran out of time to be able to do it other than in that window. And I botched it and I'm old enough and had been through 20 of these and should have known better, and I missed it. Now, Chris, if you want to take it from there about what that means for '23, feel free.Thomas Christopher PledgerYes. So obviously, that's not something we contemplated when we provided our original guidance. But the reality is, is that the guidance is more art than science. And so we've got a lot of really good things that are in the pipeline and a lot of really good things that we're working on. So as we sit here today, like I said, we weren't expecting that at the beginning of the year. But in terms of what does that mean over the rest of the year, there's a lot to play for as we continue on, and we're excited about the position we have. We think there's a lot of good opportunity to execute on, and we'll be in a good spot at the end of the year.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuYes. Okay. Understood. Scott, your confession is admirable.Scott Thomas FordWell, it's also true. So it has that...OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matt Smith of Stifel.Matt SmithHad a question about the supply chain inefficiencies and specifically around bringing the K-Cup volume up. I think it was up 44% in the quarter. But it sounds like those higher supply chain costs will continue into the second quarter, even though you've got some new equipment up and running. So can you talk about what's still weighing on the profitability in that business? And what gets better in the second half to allow that incredible sales volume growth to flow through to the profit line?Scott Thomas FordRight. Great question. Let me just back up one quick second. We had a very large single-serve manufacturing machine that was due in last October when we agreed to take on the lift in volume. That machine did not come in until February. What we did was we put together other machines to stand in the gap, but no matter what else we could throw at it when we were left without the delivery, we were behind. And when you get behind, 2 things happen. Your volume drops, obviously, relative to the orders that are coming in. You get penalized and pay fees for missing delivery at volume levels. You then have to throw over time, you run machines up against breakdown, you don't get to do maintenance, your efficiencies drop, your waste increases and now your output on a dollar of input, whether that be labor, material, machine time, whatever, all of that suffers. That did not relieve until the very end of the first quarter when the new machines were finally in installed and started to catch up. We have already caught up on the volume. We are already back at 98%, 99% in stocks with all of our customers. The expensive fees for volume misses have stopped and our efficiencies are starting to turn as we get to go through and take each machine apart, rebuild it, do proper maintenance on it. And we're seeing lifts of 50% and 100% in the efficiency of the individual machine where now that we're able to finally take it offline, rebuild it and properly tool it. So this is one of those things where you only get this kind of uptick in volume a few times in your career. And then when you get shorted the equipment that you built the model on, there is nothing to do except throw bodies at it and effort at it, and it was a mess. But as Chris said, with that machine coming in and frankly, 2 others that we were able to get alongside it, with those machines in, we've been able to catch up on our numbers. And with our numbers now, we can take machines offline and with machines offline, we're starting to run our efficiencies back down. And we've run these machines at a P&amp;L level on a per-cup basis, much better than we're running them now in the past, and I have every expectation we'll get back to that now that we can take them offline and service them.Matt SmithOkay. And because you maintained fairly high service levels and on shelf, have you been able to hold on to all of the contract volume that was initially won for that business?Scott Thomas FordWe have not been able to hang on to all of it, but I think all of it is back in play. And I would expect that over the next year, we will have all of that and more back given the current set of circumstances.Matt SmithOkay. And just one more for me. It sounded like the $4 million in disruption costs was a flow-through to gross profit as well. So if we look at gross margin and we adjust for those costs, there was some nice expansion sequentially. Could you talk about the benefits to gross margin relative to the fourth quarter, again, if we add back in that disruption costs?Thomas Christopher PledgerYes. I think what you're seeing is you're seeing growth in our higher-margin products. if you look at the mix shift of the company and the mix shift of the sales that we have, you're seeing continued growth in single-serve and you're seeing continued growth in our flavors, extracts and ingredients, which is the higher-margin business that we do. And so the whole thesis of going public was that we're going to see over a period of time, you'll continue to see the mix shift from hot black coffee in a bag or in a frac pack to single-serve cups into the cold flavors, extracts and ingredients products that we have in the highest part of our margin. And so that margin lift that you're seeing is just that playing itself out.OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Feldman of the Telsey Advisory Group.Joseph Isaac FeldmanI wanted to ask about the new Conway facility and the demand seems like it's through the roof. I guess the question I have is what gives you confidence, a, you'll get it open on time and up and running quickly? And b, how do you even prioritize the customer volume? And when do you start to think about the next facility? It sounds like you could already have another one of these things, if you could.Scott Thomas FordJoe, thanks for the question. Well, you can't assume anything, right? If you look at the discussion we just had on machines in the single-serve plant, you can imagine how paranoid we are about machines and delivery of being on time in Conway. And the financial proposition that the largest shareholders that came into the business when we went public, basically underwrote is the functioning properly in a proper time frame of the Conway facility. So we have a completely dedicated crew. We have probably added 20 people that have done these jobs before from plant managers to engineering staff to senior engineers that have built and run plants like this to product development people to quality control people who came out of plants that make these very products. And they are separated out and held in a separate team in operations. There's a project management team that is run by a former military guy, where no meeting goes past 1 minute over time, and everything gets done. And we are actually sending people to every vendor to physically walk the lines with our suppliers to make sure that we are seeing the wiring cables, the harnesses, the steel is cut, et cetera, et cetera. So I can't guarantee it, but we are doing everything corporately possible to ensure that it gets installed on time and on budget. And frankly, there are always a handful of issues, but I'm very pleased with how that team is delivering. Frankly, we have a weekly executive update, and it just coincidentally was right before this call. And I am amazed at how well that entire functioning group is delivering that project. As it turns to what we would do after that, we don't have the balance sheet to do what would come after that as we sit here today. And so we either have to answer the question, do we want to say yes and do something about that? Or are we better to let that slide 2 or 3 years and answer that question then? And that's really something that's up to our Board and something that they review just like they would any other kind of strategic move along the way.Joseph Isaac FeldmanGot it. No, that's very helpful. And then I guess one other question, maybe more for Chris. I apologize if I missed it when you talked about the year a little bit. But can you give a little more flavor for the top line? I appreciate the EBITDA commentary you gave, but maybe in terms of overall sales or any of the puts and takes we should think about for the rest of the year?Thomas Christopher PledgerWell, we didn't give sales guidance this year because we focus on EBITDA. We talked about that when we issued our original guidance. But I mean, sales have come in quite frankly, as we've expected. If you look at sort of customer demand across the different products that we have, we expect to continue to see growth year-over-year in terms of sales and more growth coming through single-serve and flavors extraction ingredients as you continue to see those products continue to take a higher percentage of the overall sales that we have within the business.Joseph Isaac FeldmanGot it. That's great. I'll turn it over to the next person.OperatorThank you. At this time, I'm seeing no more questions. So I'd like to hand it off to Scott Ford, CEO, for closing remarks.Scott Thomas FordWell, I appreciate the depth of work that the guys that get on the phone and ask us questions and go through this. I appreciate what you guys do in your models, one thing. But also in terms of what you're doing, trying to understand the business, we are a business that is changing rapidly. We're also fairly small. Nobody is going to lay up tonight accept us and worry about all the ins and outs of our small little details here. But we appreciate the fact that you take the time to do the work to provide coverage. When we were at this stage in Alltel, I had one analyst that would give us the time of day. one. And we've gotten 3 here that have asked us great questions and show that they're paying attention and doing the [organ]. So we just want to say thank you. You know where we are. We're around all the time. All we do is this. If we can ever be of help, please reach out. Thank you, guys, very much. Have a great afternoon.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In.The internet revolution gave rise to the communication services industry that keeps growing, evolving and innovating. The communication services industry is a huge area where small and large players are vying for user attention and to become the consumer’s top priority to communicate with others, consume and share media. Edward Jones in an August 2020 report noted several important trends to watch out for in the communication services sector, which the firm at the time said accounted for about 10% of the S&amp;P 500. Edward Jones said that consumers are quickly making a shift from traditional TV to online streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)+. The streaming revolution that was at its peak during August 2020 (when the report was published) has not stopped showing its impact as several companies in the communication services industry have since launched their streaming services to compete with others. The report also noted that consumers were ditching cable and satellite TV services for online subscription services that also offer traditional TV channels. Some notable names in this area were Dish and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s YouTube.One of the biggest growth catalysts and areas of competition for companies in the communication services sector has been advertising. The Edward Jones report noted that as consumers begin to consume text, audio and video online, the growth projections for the advertising industry, especially for 2021, were solid. While the report’s rosy predictions for 2021 proved to be true, the inflation crisis that started in 2022 added a lot of uncertainty in the equation. The communication services industry is currently struggling with advertising growth as inflation hammers consumers and small businesses, causing a slowdown in the industry. According to data from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), in 2022, digital advertising revenue jumped 10.8%. This growth was significantly down from the 35% growth reported in 2021. IAB expects this growth to further slow down in 2023 given the current economic situation. However, the firm believes the industry will continue to adapt to the changes as it has done in the past. Some new avenues of opportunities for the industry include video, AR, VR and artificial intelligence.Story continuesIAB’s CEO David Cohen said:“2023 promises to be a challenging year. But this industry, more than most, is galvanized by change. The job now is identifying where the areas of growth are going to be, follow the consumer and develop solutions that meet and exceed their needs.”Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) earlier this year posted solid growth for its ads revenue, surprising many. As the Federal Reserve aims to pause rates hikes and some foresee inflation getting under control, the communication services sector might be set for strong growth in the future.The communication services sector has took a beating in 2022 as the sector was weighed down by stocks like Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter (before it went private), Netflix and more. However, the sector is posting a decent performance this year, with S&amp;P 500 Communications Services Sector Index having gained about 23% year to date through May 8.Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest InPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashMethodologyWhile the communication services sector is huge and many count companies such as Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix as part of the industry, for this article focused on companies that are offering core communication services such as internet, telecom services, network services, satellite TV/internet services and more. Our criteria for stock selection was hedge fund sentiment, for which we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. We picked 13 communication services stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In13. Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Washington-based internet service company Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) ranks 13th in our list of the best communication services stocks to buy now. Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) is in the spotlight after the company raised its quarterly dividend by 1.1%.A total of 18 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of the firm was Richard Merage’s MIG Capital which owns a $36 million stake in Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI).12. Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Arizona-based broadband communications services provider Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO) ranks 12th in our list of the best communication services stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier this month Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO) posted Q1 results. GAAP EPS of $9.62 missed estimates by $4.44. Revenue in the quarter totaled $421.8 million but missed estimates by $1.14 million.Out of the 27 hedge funds that had stakes in Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO) as of the end of the fourth quarter, Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner of Tom Russo was the biggest stakeholder with a $64 million stake in the company.Atai Capital made the following comment about Cable One, Inc. (NYSE:CABO) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Cable One, Inc. (NYSE:CABO is a rural broadband provider with the majority of their footprint consisting of Coaxial rather than Fiber. For those unfamiliar with Cable One (Sparklight Internet), you can compare them to their larger, more well-known peers like Charter (Spectrum) or Comcast (Xfinity).There are however some important distinctions to make; unlike Charter and Comcast, they started to pivot away from TV subs back in 2013, and thus, their EBITDA margins are higher than the rest of the industry (~53% for CABO versus ~40% for Charter). This is because TV subs are basically a zero-margin business and contributed only ~25% of residential revenue for Cable One in 2022 but ~42% for Charter (lower margin, but still profitable for Charter). Funnily enough, I have been shocked at how often cable bears bring up TV subs as a concern on these names, not realizing they contribute nothing to the bottom line and are just a drag on margins. Another contributing factor to Cable One’s higher margins is their industry leading ARPUs (Average revenue per user), which should continue to grow moving forward…” (Please click here to read the full text)11.Iridium Communications Inc.

This exchange combined with the expected proceeds from the EMEA transaction, will allow us to focus on executing against our two-year turnaround plan, which we expect will return Lumen to growth.

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

200,8c515a09-ff51-3eb1-8b98-946792614279,V,2023-05-12,3 Stocks Poised for a Powerful Rally This Summer,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-poised-powerful-rally-092005451.html,1683537605,STORY,"['ABNB', 'BCS', 'V']","[Forecasting the direction of travel for the market in the short-term is more like heading to the casino than investing, but the current environment offers somewhat of a unique backdrop for picking stocks poised for a rally.Uncertainty in the U.S. banking sector is putting a huge amount of pressure onto many banks. However, some are well positioned to navigate the choppy waters with ease. Additionally, inflation could cause credit card usage, and therefore debt, to rise. This creates a buoyant environment for card providers.The backdrop to all of this will be the summer travel season. This is likely to be the final year of so-called revenge spending in the wake of Covid-19. Given that the labor market is still tight, consumers remain relatively confident about spending. That means summer vacations are likely high on the list of priorities, which should benefit the tourism industry. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe banking crisis together with the seasonal boost creates speculation that there could be some pockets of the market ready to deliver strong growth. Lets take a look at the top stocks poised for a rally.Barclays (BCS)the Barclays (BCS) logoSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock.comDon’t throw the baby out with the bathwater springs to mind when it comes to the current banking crisis, and that sentiment could make Barclays (NYSE:BCS) one of the best stocks to buy for a summer rally. The British bank is in a stellar position to deliver impressive growth, particularly given its relatively low valuation right now.Barclays’ U.K. banking arm has been reaping the rewards of higher interest rates. Credit card spending in the U.S. has been a boon for their top line, with the division posting revenue growth nearly 50% higher than last year. Their largest division, corporate and investment banking, is navigating choppy waters in the current environment. But, there is opportunity abound given that some players have left the space leaving market share up for grabs. Story continuesThe group is also very well capitalized, meaning it can withstand significant shocks to the system. That kind of resilience should come with a hefty price tag, but Barclays is actually looking pretty cheap right now. Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is in a sweet spot when it comes to the intersection of a cash-strapped consumer, and central banks raising interest rates. This makes it a good pick among stocks poised for a rally. The credit card company doesn’t actually lend money to its customers, instead it charges banks for moving funds. That means Visa isn’t on the hook if there’s a spate of defaults.Visa’s business model is also an attractive one. The group makes money charging a service fee based on the value of transactions. That means the more people spend, the more Visa makes. Additional transactions come with little-to-no added costs, so as revenue grows so does the bottom line.If conditions continue to worsen we could see consumers start to lean more heavily on their credit cards. Of course, a pullback in spending all together would be negative for Visa, but luckily the group’s strong cash flow puts it in a good position to navigate leaner times. Airbnb (ABNB)Woman holding mobile phone with the Airbnb logo on the screenSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comWith the summer travel season upon us, it would be impossible to talk about stocks poised for a rally without Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). The vacation rental company has become somewhat synonymous with travel, with $63.2 billion worth of bookings on its platform in 2022. This summer could be one of the last where people blow their savings in favor of a trip, but Airbnb is in a strong spot even as people start tightening their belts. The rise of the staycation is in part thanks to Airbnb, so whether it be a villa for a vacation abroad or a small home to rent for a mini-break, Airbnb will capture a large part of the travel market.The group’s optimistic about the future as well, with double digit revenue growth expected in 2023. Even more crucial is its forecast for underlying cash profit margins of 35%. These rosy forecasts are part of the reason Airbnb is a rather expensive choice, with shares trading at 42-times earnings. That does add a layer of risk, particularly if travel starts to slow, but the group’s prospects look strong even in the face of turbulence ahead. On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck held Barclays.

I’m Alan Murray.Michal Lev-Ram: And I'm Michal Lev-Ram.Murray: And, Michal, I want to start with a question for you. When you're traveling, for business or for pleasure, how and where do you choose to stay?Lev-Ram: I don't have one kind of rule of thumb. I think I look at location. When I travel for pleasure, a lot of times I do Airbnb. For hotels, I like hotels with a little bit of personality, but it's a little all over the place. I probably should have better rule for how I do this, because it's time consuming.Murray: I am a brand guy. One hundred percent loyal. Totally Marriott. I love their app. It makes it so easy to book. I stay at the AC Hotel near our office when I have a late night. I've got a timeshare in Park City for skiing. I like the Autograph Collection for hotels with personality. But what I really admire, Michal, and we will talk about this today, is how hard they have fought to avoid giving up control of their customers to the tech platforms, whether it's Expedia or Kayak or Airbnb. I wish those of us in the legacy media business had done as well 25 years ago as they're doing.Story continuesLev-Ram: Yeah, seriously. Well, I'm guessing, given all of that and how loyal you are, you are probably a little bit starstruck talking to today's guests.Murray: Well, I don't do starstruck, Michal, but I am an admirer of the company that he runs. Tony Capuano is the CEO of Marriott International.Lev-Ram: Yeah, you know, I have to say, I have to admit here that I was just a little bit embarrassed, because I took this interview while I was in a hotel room, not a Marriott.Murray: You didn't disclose?Lev-Ram: I didn't disclose. But it was actually a very nondescript hotel room and had zero personality so I was not super happy with it, but it did the job. You know. I did learn so many new things talking to Tony. I was also reminded of just the sheer size of the brand. It's made up of over 8,000 properties across 139 different countries.Murray: I think it's that massive scale that has been their secret weapon. That's why they bought Starwood. It enables them to control their customer. You know, not long before we sat down with Tony, Marriott announced an acquisition of City Express, another midsize hotel chain with 150 locations across Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean.Lev-Ram: And I have to bring up the Ritz-Carlton Yacht, which was brought up multiple times during the interview. But more on that later. Alan, when I see these massive moves that Marriott is making, I just have to wonder‚I think we've all been wondering for a few years—what is going on with the industry today? Is it back from the pandemic slump?Murray: Well, Tony had some thoughts on that. And on some other big travel trends that he's keeping an eye on. He seems to think it's more of a shift in how people travel rather than a snap back to pre-pandemic habits.Lev-Ram: eah, I really found his thoughts on the state of travel to be super interesting. We talked about bleisure as well, which is not a word that I think he likes, but you know, it's one we kind of have to use. We also talked to Tony about how their app is competing with those of big tech companies like Airbnb, which we brought up, and the sustainability initiatives in place across Marriott properties, which was also a very interesting conversation. So without further ado, here is our interview with Tony Capuano of Marriott International.Murray: Welcome to Leadership Next, Tony, and I've got to tell you before we start, I am totally a Marriott guy. I book all my hotels on the Bonvoy app. I have a timeshare in Park City where I ski every year. So, Michal, I'm biased in this conversation.Anthony Capuano: Well, good.Murray: This is my go-to hotel. But I wanted to ask you at the start, I've heard you say that Marriott International is more than just a hotel company. You've got a lot of hotels. What does it mean to be more than just a hotel company?Capuano: Well, first of all, thanks for having me today. We do we think of ourselves much more as a travel company. Obviously our foundation is built on our core lodging business, which is about 8,300 hotels in 138 countries around the world. But that business continues to expand. Just before the pandemic, we got into the home-sharing business with the launch of Marriott Homes &amp; Villas. We launched that business almost on a pilot basis with about 2,000 listings. That platform now offers over 100,000 listings. Last fall, we offered the launch of the first of several Ritz-Carlton Yachts, which is a luxury cruising experience. It's just 149 cabins. So a very intimate, very luxurious experience at sea. We obviously run the industry's largest branded residential business. Between open and pipeline projects, we've got about 225 projects around the world, disproportionately flagged with our luxury brands, like Ritz-Carlton, Edition, St. Regis. And we continue to innovate and look for other opportunities to solve travel needs for our 180 million Bonvoy members.Lev-Ram: I want to talk a little bit more about the luxury piece, because I don't think that's something that you've always been associated with. So tell us more about that.Capuano: Sure. So the company's entry into luxury started with the opening of the JW Marriott here in Washington, D.C., which Bill Marriott built in many ways as a tribute to our founder and his father. In 1995, we made a significant leap forward when we made our investment in the acquisition of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. And then over time, whether it be through M&amp;A or organic development, we've built out an industry-leading portfolio of luxury brands. We have traditional luxury with brands like Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis. Luxury lifestyle with brands like Edition and W, and even Super Premium Luxury with our partnership with Bulgari, the Italian jeweler. In fact just last week, we opened our eighth Bulgari hotel in Tokyo, and in June, I'll be in Rome for the opening of the ninth Bulgari hotel, in their home city of Rome.Lev-Ram: The other aspect here is the the global nature of just how big you guys have gotten. And I know there was just a recent acquisition that's helping you to expand in Latin America. Has this long been the strategy? Is this a market that's particularly interesting to you? And you know, what are the other geographic locations that you're closely looking at now?Capuano: Before I was appointed CEO, I ran our global development organization for about a dozen years. And I would often be asked, what is the company's development strategy? And in some ways, that was always the easiest question to answer. We want to make sure we have the right product everywhere our members travel, for every type of trip purpose. Scale matters. Alan talked a little bit about his Bonvoy membership. One of the things that strengthens that industry leading platform is the breadth of our global footprint. It is rare that one of our loyal members has to look outside the system to find accommodations, irrespective of where they're traveling and irrespective of the nature of that travel. The City Express deal that you mentioned is important on several fronts. It solidifies our leadership from a distribution perspective in the Caribbean and Latin America, which is a really important set of inbound and outbound markets. It also represents the company's entry into the midscale tier, which is a tier we've not competed in previously.Murray: And kudos to you, Tony, for doing that. I mean, Michal and I belong to an industry, the media industry, that was completely disintermediated by tech platforms, right? Google, Facebook, and to some degree, Apple, Amazon, they took over the customer. And now the customer comes through them to get to us. Ten years ago, everyone thought the same thing would happen in your industry, it would be Expedia or other platforms who would who people would go to, and you've really gotten people to your app. What percentage of your bookings happen through the app or directly with you?Capuano: The term we use is Bonvoy penetration. What percentage of our accommodated room nights come through the app, and it's between 50 and 60%. It is a disproportionate share.And I'll tell you an even more interesting statistic. Now it's early so it's a little more anecdotal than anything else, but I was shocked by this. I went and toured the first Ritz-Carlton Yacht when it was in port in Fort Lauderdale a few weeks ago, and of the folks that have either sailed on the vessel or have booked a future voyage, about 75% are Bonvoy members. And so the power of that program in exposing a new platform like Ritz-Carlton Yacht, and and helping them understand the nature of the offering, we think is a really powerful differentiator.Lev-Ram: Wow.Murray: It's so important. I mean, Michal is out there on the West Coast with all the tech companies. We all thought they were going to take over the world. You fight back and won. So what what enabled you to win over the tech platforms?Capuano: Well, you know, they are our partners. So I don't know that there are winners and losers. Each of us have objectives, and we interact with them on a daily basis. We think we can bring great value to them. And in particular, portions of our business, they are terrific generators of volume for us. The intermediaries, for instance, give us access to many travelers who don't travel as frequently. And so it's a valuable relationship, even though it's a relatively modest portion of our business. But I think back to when we were doing the Starwood acquisition, Bill Marriott, as he often does, made a simple but incredibly wise observation. As you may know, as a young man, he was in the Navy, and he said in the Navy, occasionally, you'd be out at sea, and there'd be an enormous rogue wave. And he said, you can't stop that wave, but what you can do is get in a bigger boat to try and navigate that wave. And I think as we saw folks trying to get more and more involved in the customer journey trying to claim ownership of the customer, we had a view that scale put us on a really solid footing to try and navigate that evolving environment where everybody wants to own the customer. And I think the Starwood acquisition, some other smaller regional M&amp;A deals we've done. And even some of the organic platforms that we've developed over time, have all contributed to industry leading scale, which we think puts us in a really powerful position as we try to navigate this complex landscape we operate in.Lev-Ram: So all this boat talk is really making me want to get on a Ritz-Carlton Yacht, for starters. But back to the the app for a second. Obviously, the more customers are getting to you through your app, I'm guessing the more data the more direct contact and interactions you're able to have with them. So what's the most valuable piece or you know, aspects of data that you're collecting today? And how is that informing how you actually cater to these customers?Capuano: You're exactly right. The data that we're able to collect is rich. All of it is useful from different perspectives. I would say to you, we are at our core in the hospitality business. We are in the business of serving our guests. So the more data we can collect on their specific preferences, where they like to travel, the types of rooms that they prefer to book, bedding preferences, pillow preferences, utilization of food and beverage outlets, spa, fitness classes. The more we can know about you as a guest, the better chance we have of exceeding your expectations, wherever you're traveling with us anywhere in the world.[Music starts]Murray: Jason Girzadas, the CEO-elect of Deloitte US, is a sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason.Jason Girzadas: Thank you, Alan. It's great to be here.Murray: Jason, we live in an era of disruption, technology disruption, geopolitical disruption, workplace disruption, and it makes accurate predictions about what's going to happen in the future more difficult than it has ever been. Yet the polls that we do together with you show that most business leaders largely remain optimistic. Why do you think that is?Girzadas: I think optimism is a result of the fact that we've been through an incredibly tumultuous three years. And so I think business leaders realize that they've built resiliency into their organizations. The prospect of even more disruption isn't as foreign of a concept, and I think there's more confidence in their ability to adapt and to be agile. Secondarily, there's been tremendous investment in technology and new capabilities that client organizations and executives broadly are optimistic about those creating more value and more opportunities. So, it's a function of what we've been through, as well as the investments that have been made that give a sense of optimism despite some of the headwinds.Murray: And what's your advice to companies that are struggling with the potential disruption in the future?Girzadas: Well, disruption is the new normal. I don't think there's any placid water on the horizon or calmness that we can predict. So it's a function of getting accustomed to the discontinuities that are ahead of us. Whether it's around technology, or geopolitical change, or workplace changes associated with the future of work, or the demands of the talent workforce, change is the new normal, and as a result, it is requiring executive teams to actually look holistically at those challenges, be facile with doing scenario planning and being on the lookout for where and how to capitalize on disruption—versus being concerned by it or seen as a barrier to their success.Murray: Jason, thanks for your perspective. And thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.Girzadas: Thank you.[Music ends]Murray: Tony, you, you got this job in the wake of the pandemic. For me, one of the most moving moments of the pandemic was when I saw that Twitter video that your predecessor Arne Sorenson made. He was battling cancer at the time and showing it. But he made this moving message to all your employees saying, hey, our business just dropped more than 90%, our rooms are vacant. Unfortunately, we're going to have to furlough a lot of you. Here's why, and here's what the implications are, and here's what we're going to do to try and take care of you. Where are we now? Like, are we back to pre-pandemic levels? Is it overall pre-pandemic levels, but different? Give us a little insight to all that data you have. What does travel look like today?Capuano: Happy to, although I want to thank you for talking about our friend, Arne, Alan. It's, I'm convinced that that video will be shown in business schools for the next 30 or 40 years. It was as as candid and authentic and transparent a bit of communication as I think I've ever seen a business leader make, and all of us talk about it often. It was a masterclass in leadership and communication, and he is terribly missed.Murray: I 100% agree. I spend a lot of time talking to CEOs. They very seldom make me cry. And he did.Capuano: So the business, the way I would characterize it, Alan, and if there were any questions across the world about the resilience of travel, those questions have been answered over the last two years. As you point out, and as Arne mentioned, in his associate-wide video, our business dropped more than 90%. We had real conversations within the company about our ability to survive. And many of those questions were obviously fueled by virtue of the fact that we had such modest visibility. We didn't know what we were dealing with. We didn't know whether it was going to be global. We didn't know how long it might last. Fast forward almost exactly two years from those terrifying early days, Leeny Oberg, our CFO, and I did the fourth quarter earnings call a couple months ago. And for 2022, we reported all-time record fees all-time record, adjusted EBITDA, and all-time record EPS. And so to see that dramatic turn, to me, illustrated two things. It illustrated the resilience of travel, and it illustrated the wisdom of our asset-light business model. So, to your specific question on a global basis, rev par, or revenue per available room, which is the metric we use to evaluate topline performance of our portfolio, had recovered to pre-pandemic levels on a global basis in 2022. What's particularly remarkable about that performance, we had a terribly challenging January, because of the Omicron variant, and China, which is our second largest market in the world, trailing just the U.S. was largely locked down for about 10-and-a-half months. So despite those two embedded challenges in 2022, we generated stronger financial performance than in any year of our 96-year history. So, travel is absolutely back.Murray: Is China back now too?Capuano: China is getting back. What we've seen as we watched the recovery around the world, as friction was removed from travel, as borders opened, as testing requirements were eliminated. As it became easier and easier to acquire visas where necessary. And as airlift came back, we would see spikes in in search activity, spikes in bookings and ultimately spikes in performance. Now China is trailing in terms of where it is related to those milestones, but quarter over quarter, month over month, as the friction is eliminated from inbound and outbound travel in China, we're really encouraged by the pace of recovery.Lev-Ram: So, and, I have to ask, I mean, travel is back, you're saying, but what kind of travel is it? What are the new emerging trends that you're seeing? And we cannot have this conversation without throwing in the word ""bleisure."" Sorry. As we speak, I'm actually I've been on a bleisure trip this week. I was up here in Vancouver with my husband and my son over the weekend. They went home, I stayed for work. So, case in point.Murray: Your whole life is a blur of bleisure.Lev-Ram: I don't know about that.Capuano: I like blended-trip purpose. It sounds more elegant, but, but it's all the same thing. And it's great news for our industry and for our company. I think prior to the pandemic, many of us found ourselves in that unenviable circumstance, where our family said, the kids have a long weekend from school, let's go away for four days. And we looked at our calendar for Friday and Monday and said, have a great trip. It was just inconceivable that we could leave for four days. By necessity, we learned while suboptimized, you can work from almost anywhere. And more and more of our guests, more and more of our Bonvoy members, are taking advantage of that idea of blended-trip purpose. One of the most interesting things for me to watch, we look at recovery by day of the week. And the two days of the week that have recovered most quickly are Thursday and Sunday. And so what that tells you is more and more folks are doing exactly what you just described. They are saying, I've got a business trip Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Rather than flying home Thursday, I'm going to spend the weekend with friends or family, or the following week, I have a Tuesday business trip, I'm going to go for the weekend leading up to my business travel or my group meeting and conference. So it's a really compelling byproduct of the learnings of travelers through the pandemic. The only downside I see to it, it may make it a little harder for us to tell you with absolute precision what the mix in our hotels is by demand segment. Prior to the pandemic, I could have told you to two or three decimal points how many of our guests were business travelers, how many were group meeting attendees, how many were leisure travelers. That's a little more difficult. Now, hopefully you stayed with us in Vancouver, but if you did, I guarantee no one asked you at the front desk how many of your nights are business travel and how many are leisure? Which is fine. I often get a question. You might recall in the early days of the pandemic, there were many experts who said business travel is forever impaired, it will never come back. I get that question often. And my answer is I don't believe travel is impaired. In fact, I think travel will go and continue to grow to new heights. My ability to tell you whether one segment is fully recovered will be a little more difficult because of this blended trip purpose. But that's only good news for the industry.Murray: I have a design suggestion on that front, by the way.Capuano: Okay.Murray: The desks in most of the hotel rooms I end up in still face the wall. And to successfully pull off a Zoom call, you need a little light on your face. And so I find myself either trying to rearrange the furniture or coming up with some jury rigged structure.Capuano: Well, Alan, we need to get you here to our beautiful new headquarters. We've got an amazing innovation lab. And one of the things we do in that lab is we build room configurations. And we bring our Bonvoy members through to move furniture around, to test distances between outlets and desks and all the sorts of things that can enhance your stay. So, let me know when you're in Bethesda.Murray: So, Tony, you were only the second person to be CEO of Marriott whose name is not Marriott. We already talked about Arne. But when I go to my ski resort in Park City, the founder and his son are still hanging on the wall. I wonder, first of all how you got there because that's obviously a position of trust and what it's like running a company that is so closely associated with one family.Capuano: The Marriott family is remarkable. It is a in every sense of the world, a real global success story. To think about JW Marriott, Sr. and his wife, Ali. He was a sheepherder. They got in a Model T. They drove across the country and opened a nine-seat root beer stand here in Washington, D.C. And to grow from those humble beginnings to the world's largest lodging company is remarkable, and that path of growth is filled with some of the most important innovations in the history of our industry. The company can with great pride can look at the the adoption of revenue management technology, moving that from the airlines to lodging, the pursuit of a multi-tiered brand strategy, the implementation of a loyalty program are all innovations that have shaped the industry that we have the Marriott family to thank. They are still deeply involved. Bill Marriott is our chairman emeritus. He just had his 91st birthday. It is a gift to me that I get to speak to him a couple times a week, and he is deeply engaged in the business. His youngest son, David, is our third ever chairman of the board, all of whom have been members of the family. He is a friend, he is a partner, as we try to help the company reach its full potential. And as I talk to our associates around the world, notwithstanding the size and scale of the company, I think they very much view it as a family business. And that is a tremendous competitive advantage.Murray: Tony, I know these days, every time I go into a Marriott Hotel, I get messages about sustainability. You know, what to do with my towels, etc.? Why is that important to Marriott, and how big a difference can Marriott make in the climate battle?Capuano: I'd say two reasons. Maybe I'll start with my personal view. I am very much of the view that all of us are extraordinarily fortunate to be short-term tenants on this this beautiful planet, and we have a personal responsibility to care for the planet. Through a business lens, I would tell you that I often describe our business model as having four principal constituents: our associates, our guests, our owner community, and ultimately, our shareholders. Every one of those constituents is demanding that we set stretch goals around sustainability, and show demonstrated progress against those goals. And so both from a personal or moral perspective, but also from a business imperative perspective, it's critical. There are a lot of areas we can help. We've made some commitments about reducing water usage. We've eliminated single-use guest amenity plastics, which will result in 500 million less plastic bottles a year ending up in landfills, we're very focused on reducing food waste. That's a personal passion of mine. It is stunning to me that given the amount of food insecurity in the world, 40% of food that is produced ends up in the trash. I was in India last week touring hotels, and had the pleasure to spend an hour with Prime Minister Modi. It is a huge focus in India, I hear the same things in other jurisdictions around the world. And it is an imperative for the travel sector to be a leader in sustainability.Lev-Ram: I want to ask another question on the environmental and social responsibility side. My understanding is that you have trained associates to basically look out for unrecognized signs of human trafficking. Can you talk about how you got started on that journey? Why it's important and, I mean, even how big of a problem it is, because I think a lot of people would be surprised, and just what you're planning to do more in this area?Capuano: I'm glad you asked. Human trafficking is, to state the obvious, it's a scourge on humanity. It is horrific. And it is much more widespread geographically than most people realize. As I talk to our associates and our partners around the world, I think there is a misperception that it tends to be a bigger problem outside the U.S. That is most certainly the case. But it is a very significant issue here at home as well. Unfortunately, there are lots and lots of wonderful things that take place in hotels—anniversaries, birthdays, honeymoons, all sorts of things. One of the not so nice things that happens in hotels is human traffickers feel like they have some measure of anonymity. And so sometimes these terrible things are happening in hotels. We recognize that and thought we could be part of the solution. So we developed a training program. I'm proud to tell you that we have trained a million Marriott associates worldwide on what to look for. And if you see something that that seems inappropriate, how to proceed, when and how to involve your supervisor, when and how to involve the authorities. And we have some amazing stories, real life stories of trafficking victims being saved by the courageous actions of our associates. We thought it was such an important issue that it was not a competitive issue. It was an industry-wide issue. So we actually partnered with the American Hotel and Lodging Association, and made our training available to all of our competitors. And I'm just as happy to tell you that our competitors have trained about 800,000 of their employees. And so it's an area where I think our industry can have a meaningful and measurable impact on a huge societal problem.Murray: You talked about those million associates who you trained, which is a reminder just how many people you employ. It's one of the reasons that for the past year we've lived through this unusual situation where high-profile tech companies have been laying people off. But then at the end, or the beginning of the month, when the unemployment numbers come out, the unemployment rate has gone down, and it's usually because the hospitality industry has been hiring so many people. Where are we in the in the talent battle right now. Can you get the people you need to run all your hotels?Capuano: So Alan, last year, we hired about 190,000 new associates, which is the most we've ever hired in a single year. In a pre-pandemic world here in the U.S., our biggest market, on an average run rate basis at any one time, there might have been, plus or minus, 6,000 job vacancies. That number more than doubled in the early days of the recovery. The last time I looked at the number, maybe a month ago, we had only about 5,000 vacancies. So the good news is, for our industry, we're relatively back to full employment. But I would give you two caveats. Number one, in a pre-pandemic world, those vacancies were likely spread fairly evenly across the system. Right now, they're probably a little more heavily concentrated in the markets that have recovered most quickly, the leisure destinations in particular. The other thing I would tell you is on the good news front, we're seeing a very significant uptick in the volume of applications that we're receiving. But we're receiving a higher percentage of applications from energized, smiling, excited prospective associates who have zero previous experience in hospitality. So that's creating both some challenges and some opportunities for us in terms of how we train and onboard and retain those newly hired associates.Lev-Ram: So, Alan, can I end on a fun question?Murray: Go.Lev-Ram: Okay, Tony, I'm guessing you've got lifetime platinum elite status, whatever the highest ranking is. But do you have any idea off the top of your head how many nights stayed?Capuano: In my life?Lev-Ram: Yeah, lifetime.Capuano: Oh, my goodness. Well, I would say over the course of my 28 years with the company, I've probably averaged 150 nights a year.Lev-Ram: Okay.Capuano: So, the short answer is a whole bunch. And I love every bit of it. In fact, somebody asked me the other day, if there was anything particularly frustrating about my job, and it's the fact that I have to acknowledge, I will likely not get to visit the associates at all 8,300 of our hotels. The most fulfilling most energizing part of my role is to show up at one of our properties, and see the passion and resilience and enthusiasm of our associates. So I don't know that I'll make all 8,300, but it certainly won't be for lack of trying.Murray: I was just checking my app, Michal. I have 746 nights.Lev-Ram: Wow. That's impressive, Alan.Murray: I'm going to keep working on that.Capuano: Let me know when you hit 1,000.Murray: I'll send you a note. Thank you so much. Fascinating conversation.Capuano: My pleasure. Thank you so much for having me.Lev-Ram: Thank you, Tony.Murray: Leadership Next is edited and produced by Alexis Haut. Our theme is by Jason Snell.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 most luxurious hotels in the world.The global tourism industry is in fact a huge industry, encompassing multiples of other industries like travel, accommodation, attractions. People across the world travel for vacation, work, family, and it is a dream to stay in a luxury hotel. There aren’t any fixed standards of what a luxurious hotel will comprise of; however, what you can probably expect from them is amazing customer service. Most of them will comprise of high end spas, fine dining restaurants, and an experience that one will remember.However, the hotel industry was one of the hardest hit during the pandemic of COVID-19, that sent most of the countries into a complete lockdown. It was an unprecedented crisis that rendered millions of people unemployed. The hospitality business was at a high risk of collapse during the outbreak of this virus. As soon as WHO categorized this virus as a pandemic, hotel occupancy declined globally from March 2020. This led to hotels facing financial troubles, resulting in employees getting fired, and hotels that couldn't survive the financial crisis were eventually forced to close. Some of these were extremely shocking for people who had spent a lot of time staying in these hotels. It wasn't until hotels started strictly following health protocols and safety measures to convince people  that they would not be risking their lives staying at their hotels, that people actually began staying at hotels again. Even by the end of 2021, there were strict travel restrictions still quite active, and hence it isn't a surprise that compared to 2020, there was only a 4% increase in international tourist arrival as reported by  the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Let's not forget that this was still 72% below what 2019 had reported, resulting in almost a billion fewer international travels in comparison to the situation that existed before COVID-19 hit the world. For decades, the tourism industry had only seen growth until the pandemic occurred and changed our ""normal"" forever.Story continues30 most luxurious hotels in the worldKaspars Grinvalds/Shutterstock.comHowever, in 2023, we can safely say that the travel and hotel economy is finally on the road to recovery. Even though it is still far from the pre-pandemic levels, hopes are not lost as some successes are evident. After a rough couple of years, as the conditions of the pandemic improved, people began to travel again. Even though there is always a risk of a new virus or a new COVID variant that may strike the human population, people have now begun to move past it and move on with their lives as normally as they can.According to Deloitte's 2023 travel outlook, with an increase in fare rates and travel expenditures due to the economic conditions globally, people are citing ""financial constraints"" as their number 1 reason for not considering traveling. Or, they might consider traveling domestically instead of taking a big international trip, for example. ""As travelers consider the price vs. value proposition of travel, a looming concern of hoteliers and airlines is their ability to deliver the experiences travelers expect,"" reported Deloitte. The travel industry had to face an overwhelming situation of short staffing amidst the pandemic. After the health sector, it was the hotel and hospitality sector that was facing the most risk, dealing with people in person, face to face. Based on this report, hotels have increased wages and also offered more benefits in order to retain their staff and help them with this crisis. However, even through all these tough situations, the hotel industry's trends are only seen going upwards now. Even with the fear of recession and an extremely high inflation rate globally, there is no stopping tourism anymore. The CEO of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Tony Capuano mentioned that their luxury portfolio, which includes high end hotels like Ritz-Carlton, St.Regis and JW Marriott faced an increase of approximately 30% in 2022's first quarter, as compared to their rates in 2019.According to Marriott's Q4 2022 earning calls transcript, ""Momentum in conversions continues, including in multi-property opportunities, thanks to the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across the chain scales. The meaningful top- and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of our portfolio make these brands very attractive to owners. Conversions represented nearly 20 percent of room signings and 27 percent of room additions in 2022. We added a total of 394 properties last year, representing more than 65,000 rooms, and grew our industry-leading system 4.4 percent on a gross basis, or 3.1 percent, net, year over year. Excluding the impact from our exit from Russia, our net rooms growth was 3.6 percent. For 2023, we are forecasting gross rooms growth of around 5.5 percent, including around 1 percentage point from the anticipated addition of the City Express rooms to our franchise system. Assuming deletions of 1 to 1.5 percent, net rooms could grow 4 to 4.5 percent. "" Another luxury hotel chain, Wyndham hotels and resorts, was able to generate a net income of approximately $56 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $48 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2021.Methodology:To figure out the most luxurious hotels in the world was a difficult task, since it is a fairly subjective view point. However, for this ranking, we took rankings from 3 usually reliable sources. We took them from Conde Nast, Reader's Digest and Trip Advisor, as we find these to be credible sources of information. We then assigned a score to each hotel, based on its ranking in the list. For example, if a hotel ranked number one a list of 25 hotels, we ranked it 25/25 =1, while second place was ranked 24/25 and so on and so forth. We then ranked all hotels from all 3 lists, from highest to lowest, to calculate our own rankings. Hence, we now take a look at the 30 most luxurious hotels in the world, starting with number 30.30.

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Michael FlorinThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy.

The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.Story continuesRobert J. ThomsonThank you, Mike. Before discussing our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, it is particularly important to begin by noting that today marks the 44th day in captivity for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was wrongfully, willfully detained in Russia. I would like to express our thanks and that of Almar Latour, Emma Tucker and all at Dow Jones for the outstanding support shown for Evan and his family by the U.S. and many other governments, media companies, journalism organizations and concerned principled people around the world. We trust that justice and common sense will prevail, and that Evan will soon be released.Turning now to the third quarter results. We began to see meaningful improvements compared to the prior quarter with certain macro and sectoral trends more positive and our cost-cutting program beginning to gain traction. For context, these earnings follow record revenues and profitability in fiscal 2022, and we have been confronting the challenges of foreign exchange volatility, a surge in interest rates, persistent inflation and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Our results demonstrate the fundamental differences in the character of News Corp compared with other media companies. In a period in which advertising activity was clearly insipid in certain parts of the world, our core nonadvertising revenue was particularly robust, highlighted by a 38% increase in revenues at the Dow Jones Professional Information business. For the quarter, total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down only 2% year-over-year as compared to the 7% decline in Q2. Adjusted revenues, excluding our acquisitions and distinctly unfavorable ForEx movements, equaled those of last year. Meanwhile, profitability was $320 million, down 11% despite a tough prior year comparison and the just articulated external pressures. As for the company-wide cost reduction drive, we are well advanced in taking the difficult but necessary step of reducing headcount by 5%, which is now expected to yield more than $160 million in annualized savings by the end of this calendar year. In addition, we are strictly scrutinizing spending across all categories and expect further savings as we strive for efficiency and efficacy. There has been much discussion, some of it was enlightened, some not so, about the potential impact of generative AI, and there is no doubt that it will profoundly affect the media business. Candidly, generative AI may pose a challenge to our intellectual property and to the future of journalism. As those who've experimented with ChatGPT will be aware, the answers are only as insightful and factual as the source material and are more retrospective than contemporary. Given those precepts, we see 3 areas in which our content will be used by generative AI creators whose products will be enhanced by our IP for which we should be compensated.Firstly, our content will inevitably be used as has already been exploited to train AI engines. Secondly, specific examples of our content will be surfaced in response to users' AI queries. And thirdly and crucially, our content will certainly be aggregated and synthesized and those answers monetized by other parties. We expect our fair share of that monetization.Generative AI cannot be degenerative AI. The digital debate over content and journalism has evolved significantly in the past few years. And we appreciate the social and commercial commitment of our partners at Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta. The A in AI cannot be ambiguity nor can the I represent ignorance. Integrity would be more apt, which brings us to Dow Jones, among the world's foremost and most trusted purveyors of business news, data and analysis.The third quarter reflected its robust revenue generation even in testing economic times. And as I mentioned, was highlighted by the burgeoning of our professional information business, which reported a 38% surge in revenues, including a 16% rise at our Risk &amp; Compliance business, and that number was negatively affected by ForEx fluctuations. Dow Jones has certainly benefited from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, which continued their high-margin growth in recent months. We will be expanding their product offerings over the next year with particular emphasis on renewables and carbon metrics, and we are confident of many years of strong growth ahead. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of all revenues at Dow Jones, a significant increase from the 60% level during fiscal 2018. Aside from the professional information business, digital subscriptions continue to grow up 9% to 3.3 million at The Wall Street Journal and up 10% to 4.3 million at Dow Jones as a whole, with total subscriptions now at 5.1 million despite print subscriptions, obviously being under some pressure.The strong performance overall came despite an insipid ad market in the U.S. with continued weakness in tech advertising, so we did see an improvement in demand in April. So the auguries have improved. Dare I say, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has been a catalyst for other U.S. financial institutions to try to reassure customers and highlight their own solidity. And The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and MarketWatch are vital platforms for any financial firm aspiring to bolster its credentials. In Australia, Foxtel Group continues to build on its streaming success. Streaming now accounts for 2/3 of the total Foxtel subscription base. And that revenue growth is more than offsetting the decline in broadcast. Fears that our world-class streaming products would be a catalyst for cannibalization have been unfounded. Broadcast churn is at near record low levels with Foxtel retail churn in March under 10%. That success is also a tribute to our marketing and customer service teams at Foxtel and to the leadership of Patrick Delany and Siobhan McKenna.As at the end of March, Binge, our entertainment streaming product, launched advertising on its basic service, adding a new lucrative revenue stream. Interest from advertisers has been ardent as the initial phase of packages were sold out. We have demand and seemingly some flexibility on pricing in the months and years ahead. After a couple of tough quarters, fortunes have certainly improved at HarperCollins with a bevy of bestsellers and some moderation of supply chain snafus. Margins were higher in the third quarter compared to the first half. We also have an attractive roster of books in this in upcoming quarters. So we believe we are on a journey to the sunlit uplands. Amazon's orders improved in the quarter, and our titles prospered in particular, Ron DeSanit's', The Courage to be Free; Barbara Kingsolver's, Demon Copperhead; as well as Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's, Never Never; and Ben Halls, Saved. In the fourth quarter, Kat Timpf is already topping bestseller list with You Can't Joke About That. If I could make a self-interested recommendation, it is worth a read or a listen. Last week, we also published the latest incarnation of the Magnolia Table Cookbook. We are justifiably optimistic about prospects for the Bridgerton prequel Queen Charlotte by Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes, which went on sale this week, coinciding with the launch of the new Netflix series. The News Media segment reported a substantial improvement over the second quarter with advertising in constant currency increasing 2%, though down 5% in U.S. dollars. This increase was a vastly different outcome to that of most media companies in most countries. We are confident that our teams are more skilled in sharing advertising insights across borders and platforms, and that innate intelligence is reflected in our revenue numbers. One success story is the sun.com, where total page views in the quarter surged 94% year-over-year, reaching close to 1 billion views. The site, which has benefited from the partnership with the New York Post and our other U.S. properties, has triumphed in tough times, and notably, The Sun's U.S. digital advertising revenues now exceed those of the British platform. In the U.K., connected listing hours at wireless hit an all-time high, reaching an average of 8.4 million per week in the quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year and reflective of our superb coverage of the Premier League, which reaches its seasonal crescendo in coming days, hopefully with an against-the-odds triumph by Arsenal. And as for the New York Post, the previously perennial lossmaker continues to be profitable in the third quarter and to build on its important influence on the national debate. Engagement at The Post digital properties rose 4% over the prior year to 690 million page views in March, providing a powerful platform for its compelling content. At Digital Real Estate Services, obviously enough, the interest rate surged and accompanying uncertainty in the housing market have had an impact in the U.S. and Australia, but these are not permanent conditions and the digitization of the property market is far from complete. There were signs of improvement in the market this quarter, but we understand that the increase in rates has had an impact on affordability and created uncertainty for potential house sellers and buyers. When that uncertainty evaporates, we'll be primed to take full advantage of the opportunity. In the midst of the challenges, realtor is focusing on adjacencies, particularly on the sell side and rental segments, and we are continuing to see benefits from the use of our media platforms, among others, the wsj.com, New York Post and the U.S. edition of The Sun to drive brand recognition and generate traffic. The result of that campaign was seen in the past quarter, and we expect they will continue to be seen in coming quarters. Since the campaign began in February, the project has generated more than 0.5 billion impressions, and showing the unique power we have to bolster brands and turbocharge traffic. Realtor.com also further integrated UpNest into its seller experiences in Q3, and is seeing significantly higher conversion rates. At REA, revenues were softer in Q3 compared to the prior year due to the lower listing volume that we are seeing encouraging signs with realestate.com.au, reaching almost 132 million visits in March, the highest total in 16 months and the fifth highest on record. With indications that prices and demand are again strengthening in Australia, we believe we are poised to prosper.And that is also true in India, where housing.com is the leading digital property platform and saw 21% year-over-year growth in average site visits in the quarter. It is worth noting this metric, as India has just passed China as the most populous country and continues to have relative political stability and enormous economic potential. As I said at the outset, there has been much tangible progress in the third quarter. And the auguries are certainly positive for coming quarters. We will absolutely focus on our core engines of growth and prioritize simplification, cost reductions and thoughtful capital stewardship. We remain committed to constantly reviewing our structure and to creating enduring value for our shareholders. And now to provide more insight into third quarter developments, I turn to Susan Panuccio.Susan Lee PanuccioThank you, Robert. Our financial results this quarter demonstrated tangible improvements from the first half, which combined with the implementation of our aggressive cost actions, should position News Corp well for fiscal 2024. We Third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down just 2% year-over-year, which was a significant improvement from the second quarter rate and included a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, third quarter adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year with improving trends at the News Media subscription video services and Book Publishing segments, offset by the decline at Digital Real Estate Services segment. Advertising trends were mixed across our geographies. Total segment EBITDA was $320 million, 11% lower compared to the prior year's record Q3 profits. Results included $7 million of professional fees related to the proposed merger with Fox and the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 15% versus the prior year.For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Before I discuss the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our headcount reduction program. Reductions across the business units will vary given the differing nature of our businesses and cost work done to date. We currently expect the annualized growth cost savings to exceed $160 million, up from our initial estimate of at least $130 million with the majority of the savings to be reflected in fiscal 2024. We also expect to incur approximately $90 million to $100 million of cash restructuring charges related to the headcount reductions in the second half of fiscal 2023. Moving on to the results of the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $363 million, down 13% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures on both the U.S. and the Australian housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $13 million or 3% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 26% to $102 million, impacted by lower revenues, the negative impact related to currency headwinds and higher costs related to REA India, partially offset by lower costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 24%. REA revenues were $222 million, which declined 10% on a reported basis or down 4% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower residential revenues and to a lesser extent, softness in financial services. In the quarter, Australia national residential buy listings were down 12%, with Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses increased uptake in premium products, including Premier Plus, favorable depth penetration and another robust performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Like our other businesses at News Corp, REA is taking steps to reduce expenses with a focus on discretionary operational spend and marketing costs. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. At Move, revenues were $141 million, down 17% compared to the prior year. Real estate revenues were down 23%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflecting broader housing market challenges. Lead volume fell 30%, while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 24% to $72 million in the third quarter based on internal metrics, yet up from the $66 million in the second quarter. Realtor has been focusing on optimizing revenues via a prioritized set of initiatives while managing operating expenses as the business weathers ongoing market headwinds. Initiatives include enhancing media advertising placements, including implementing a broader partnership with the businesses across News Corp; optimizing lead allocation across markets; accelerating our go direct path for new homes; and building out the rentals vertical. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $477 million, down 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 2% versus the prior year, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 20% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and Binge. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to nearly 4.6 million at quarter end, up 6% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately 3 million, increasing 16% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 65% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Paid subscribers for Kayo reached a record of over 1.3 million, up 14% year-over-year. Net adds from the prior quarter improved to 183,000, the largest sequential increase in 7 quarters with the start of the popular winter sports codes in March. Revenues also benefited from a price rise implemented in February. Binge paid subscribers grew 22% year-over-year or 109,000 net adds from the last quarter to nearly 1.5 million subscribers, benefiting from the successful release of the Last of Us. As Robert mentioned, on March 30, Foxtel introduced advertising within the Binge Basic product. The product accounts for approximately 30% of all Binge subscribers. We expect a modest revenue contribution from advertising beginning in the fourth quarter.Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down 200 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%. In fact, Foxtel retail churn was just under 10% for March 2023. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 84. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $68 million was down 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 9%, reflecting higher sports costs due to contractual escalators and enhancements.Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted healthy top line growth in the third quarter with revenues of $529 million, up 9% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 80% of total revenues, up 3 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, impacted by weaker advertising revenues compared to the prior year. We are continuing to see very strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 38% year-over-year, reflecting the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, coupled with strong revenues from Risk &amp; Compliance. PIB revenues accounted for 37% of segment revenues. Risk &amp; Compliance revenues rose 16% despite a 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency, led by an increase in demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. The pipeline remains robust, most notably in EMEA. OPIS and CMA's strong revenue performance is helping reshape Dow Jones revenues to be more recurring as we have increased pricing across our customer base. As Robert mentioned, its carbon index offering continues to expand, and we expect will lead to the creation of new products for current and new customers. Retention rates for OPIS and CMA's products remained well over 90% in the quarter. Circulation revenues declined 1%. The modest decline was driven by lower print volumes and some softness in IBD. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 10% year-over-year or by 208,000 sequentially, the highest net adds since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The focus this year has been on the launch of bundles, which expanded to include IBD in the third quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $88 million and accounted for 17% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. Within advertising, digital fell 17% and print was down 8%, with notable impacts from the technology and finance categories, as we mentioned last quarter. While the advertising market remains challenged, we are seeing encouraging signs with the rate of decline abating. After hitting a low in December, each successive month showed an improvement, with March notably down mid-single digits, and we saw further improvements in April. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 24% to $109 million as cost growth moderated from the first half, albeit the business is still experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures. The results also reflect the lapping of transaction costs related to the OPIS acquisition last year. Segment EBITDA margins rose to over 20%. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 11%.At Book Publishing, revenues were flat at $515 million, driven by higher Christian book sales offset by foreign currency fluctuations. After a challenging first half of the year, we saw some positive trends with stability in Amazon orders in North America following the reset in the first half as well as stronger performance from several recent titles. Segment EBITDA declined 9% to $61 million. Costs rose approximately 1%, reflecting ongoing supply chain issues in North America, specifically in manufacturing, distribution and freight costs, which are now showing signs of moderation.The headcount initiative is well underway, which should result in lower employee costs in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, HarperCollins also settled a 3-month-long strike with the UAW. The backlist represents 60% of revenues for the quarter, up slightly from last year. Digital sales declined 3% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales, in line with the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 2%, and segment EBITDA fell over 7%.Turning to News Media. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% and included a $42 million or 7% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues rose 4%, improving from the prior quarter rate. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4% but rose 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit digital subscriber growth across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. Advertising trends improved this quarter as advertising revenues were down 5%, but gained 2% in constant currency. Advertising revenues at News U.K. rose 8% in constant currency, led by strong digital advertising performance which is continuing to benefit from the growing scale of the sun.com in the U.S. and an improved performance at The Times and Sunday Times. Advertising was flat at News Australia in constant currency and notably, both Australia and the New York Post benefited from an improvement in print advertising this quarter. Segment EBITDA of $34 million declined 13%, reflecting a much more modest decline from the first half rate as incremental year-over-year investments related to the TalkTV initiative in the U.K. and other digital initiatives in Australia slowed to approximately $13 million. Newsprint costs remain a challenge, having $40 million of negative impact this quarter from higher prices. Those pressures were partially offset by ongoing cost-saving initiatives across the businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 5%. Turning to the outlook. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included an extra week, which contributed $110 million to revenues or about 4% to revenue growth and will impact prior year compares. We continue to face some supply chain and inflationary pressures and advertising conditions remain uncertain. However, it is important to note that the company's exposure to advertising has materially declined as a result of the reshaping of our portfolio, including the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. In fact, advertising revenues represented only 16% of total revenues in the third quarter. Despite the extra week, a difficult prior year comparison and ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, given current spot rates, we expect to see improvements in profitability in the fourth quarter as we continue to implement aggressive cost initiatives.Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April declined 24%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, like the third quarter, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term, and we will continue to balance marketing spend and reinvestment in adjacencies with necessary cost reductions elsewhere.In Subscription Video Services, we continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable to the prior year despite a step-up in sports rights costs in the second half related to annual contractual escalators. At Dow Jones, we saw an improvement in advertising in April, albeit visibility remains limited as the prior year compares will be further impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2022. We expect the rate of investment spending to slow, which should lead to improved profitability in the fourth quarter. We have now fully lapped the OPIS acquisitions in the third quarter and will lap CMA in June. In Book Publishing, April revenue trends were soft, consistent with industry data, but we expect cost pressures to start to moderate and are optimistic about our release slide, which as Robert noted, includes Magnolia Table Volume 3 from Joanna Gaines, and Queen Charlotte, a prequel to Bridgerton from Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes.At News Media, advertising trends remain volatile with limited visibility. We expect total segment cost decline, in part, due to lower incremental costs related to the TalkTV investment, which launched in April 2022, and we hope to see improved profitability for the segment. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.David KarnovskyRobert, following up on your comments about generative AI. I'd be interested to get kind of your expanded view on how you think this tech is going to impact how consumers receive their news and information and what opportunities or risks that opens up for you in terms of your relationship with readers. And then maybe as a follow-on, what use cases do you see for the technology and the generation or repackaging of some of the news content produced?Robert J. ThomsonDavid, a very thoughtful question. We're obviously at an early stage of the evolution of generative AI, it will have a profound impact. And I was recently tech hosting our teams, and in recent months, HarperCollins Japan has been using sophisticated programs to create images for manga stories by transforming a sketch or a photo or just inputting words through a separate generative AI programs. We use an image from our library to create complete manga scenes, obviously saving a lot of time and transforming potentially the character of that business. But it's not only going to have an impact on content, it will clearly have a profound impact on the management of the business, whether customer service or billing or whatever. I mean one contradiction of any business is that the more you customize, the harder and more expensive it is to scale. And that contradiction can be overcome with AI. I think as the well-known management consultant Socrates observed, the secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but building the new.OperatorThe next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.Kane HannanMaybe just the cost out. I'm just interested, I suppose, on some of the commentary there, particularly Dow Jones, and then books was pretty positive on the top line outlook and how things have been improving. Just interested why the cost out target has been upgraded with that backdrop. And I suppose as a follow-on to that, just what the net benefit of the cost-out program was in the first quarter, if we think about all-in with the restructuring charges potentially coming through?Robert J. ThomsonKane, look, obviously, the headcount reduction is about calibration, not celebration, but it's fair to say that the savings will exceed the -- significantly the $136 million that we identified in the last earnings call, and we'll now surpass $160 million. That's attribute to the diligence of our teams undertaking difficult work. And to emphasize that's just one element of the cost cutting that's underway at the company as we severely scrutinize everything from tech spend to travel expenses. So the total savings number next year will obviously exceed that total.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Kane, just to add, our business units, they're quite experienced at identifying areas for improvement, and we can leverage those across the group as we look for cost savings, which is one of the reasons we've been able to drive additional cost savings. We're not going to get into the details about sort of the net off of the cost savings, but we can expect that as we head into fiscal 2024, from Q1, we really would expect to see the majority of those cost savings hit the P&amp;L.OperatorThe next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.Craig Anthony HuberCraig Huber. I had a similar question on the cost. Obviously, you've announced 5% head count reduction 3 months ago. That's roughly about 2% of the total costs. Can you quantify at all what the other cost savings you're talking about is? I mean, a few companies just reduced headcount but don't touch other stuff, and you guys are taking costs out elsewhere. Can you quantify that for us? Is that possible?Susan Lee PanuccioWe haven't quantified it, Craig. But what I can say is cuts across a couple different areas. We're looking at discretionary spend, as you'd expect, office expenses, T&amp;E, we have a look across our print sites, and we're constantly looking for opportunities around our manufacturing plants and what we can do there. We look at our casual cost base with the variable costs. We have a look at marketing costs as well. So it's really a variety of costs that we continue to focus on. As I said, the businesses are pretty good at actually having a look at this now.OperatorThe next question will come from Darren Leung from Macquarie.Darren LeungI just wanted to ask around the high printing costs and supply chain issues in books, please. So I think we had talked about it being a headwind in prior periods. And looking at it, it looks like it's flat versus the prior year. Can you just give us a feel as to what we've achieved or what's changed in the business to sort of maintain that, please?Susan Lee PanuccioActually, I think the comps are up year-on-year because we are still experiencing some of those supply chain pressures. I mean what I would say is freight costs, we're seeing a moderating of that as we're seeing easing of some of the supply chain pressures on shipping costs. But we are seeing enhanced paper costs still coming through, and we're seeing some additional fuel costs that are coming in because of the inflationary pressures. So it was a little bit mixed. We are seeing them moderating, but they have been up.Robert J. ThomsonAnd so Darren, just to supplement Susan. Of course, what has been particularly prevalent over the past year is the change in purchasing, as I said, at Amazon. And now that the reset has been reset, we have more confidence in the profitability of HarperCollins. And no doubt that the current crop of bestsellers will make a positive difference in coming quarters.OperatorOur next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.Alan Steven GouldRobert, Susan, I'm always shocked how well the News Media business continues to hold up. Two things on there. Can you give us a little more detail of what's happening with TalkTV and the plans to turn that profitably? And secondly, just shocked to see print advertising actually doing better than digital advertising this quarter. What is happening there?Robert J. ThomsonWell, Alan, on TalkTV, we've always said it will be a low-cost, high-quality project, and that we'll constantly review progress and technological developments that give us flexibility in delivery and reduced expenses. In the coming months, you should see that incremental costs are falling with a naturally positive impact on our earnings. And I have to say the venture has certainly enabled us to promote products across a plethora of our platforms and enhanced our video capability globally, given that we're able to slice and dice programs in different formats for different time zones. And as you can imagine, increasing our video expertise generally is a core priority for all our businesses.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd then Alan, just on the print side, I mean, look, it has been a pleasant surprise, and we've seen this over the last couple of years as it relates to print advertising. It really just depends on the categories. Down in Australia, they've seen a pickup in travel advertising, which has really helped Dow there as the market has started to open up. They do get some good tailwinds from retail in different quarters as well. So it really is variable each quarter, but it's down to the different category.OperatorWe'll take a follow-up from Craig Huber from Huber Research.Craig Anthony HuberSorry. Sorry about that. Your book revenues held up much better than we thought in the quarter. I mean, given the issues you guys have called out in the past about Amazon and warehouse issues with them and stuff, can you just talk through that? Or do you think that's all behind you now?Robert J. ThomsonCraig, as I mentioned earlier, there clearly has been an adjustment at Amazon. That adjustment, as we understand it, is complete. And so those awkward moments are passed. And now really, it's down to the quality of the frontlist and expanding the impact of our backlist. For example, in the most recent quarter, backlist was 60% of sales. As you know, backlist generally is more profitable for us. And so now we have an opportunity to make the most of our excellent authors and our marketing potential.Susan Lee PanuccioAnd Craig, we're also -- I mean, for April, we've just had the results come in, and there has been a little bit of softness just in consumption. So we're still waiting to see where consumption settles down in the post-COVID world. But pleasingly the results for Q3 were much better than the first half.OperatorAt this time, we have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Michael Florin for closing remarks.Michael FlorinGreat. Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a great day, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.]"

The decline was primarily due to a $98 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment due to continued challenging housing market conditions in the U.S. and Australia. The decline was partially offset by higher Dow Jones segment revenues, which includes the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics (""CMA""), and higher revenues at the News Media and Subscription Video Services segments on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Revenues (which excludes the foreign currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures as defined in Note 2) were flat compared to the prior year.Net income for the quarter was $59 million, a 43% decline compared to $104 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Total Segment EBITDA, as discussed below, higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher losses from equity affiliates, partially offset by lower impairment charges.The Company reported third quarter Total Segment EBITDA of $320 million, an 11% decline compared to $358 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above, higher costs at the Dow Jones segment, and a $13 million, or 4%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The results this quarter also include $7 million of costs related to the professional fees incurred by the Special Committee and the Company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust, as well as the fees related to the potential sale of Move.

Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) decreased 10% and 24%, respectively.In the quarter, revenues at REA Group decreased $24 million, or 10%, to $222 million, driven by a $13 million, or 6%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower Australian residential revenues due to the decline in national listings, most notably in Sydney and Melbourne, and lower financial services revenues due to declines in settlement activity. The decline was partially offset by price increases, increased penetration of Premiere Plus, increased depth penetration in the Australian residential business and higher revenues from REA India. Australian national residential buy listing volumes in the quarter declined 12% compared to the prior year, with listings in Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively.Move’s revenues in the quarter decreased $29 million, or 17%, to $141 million, primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues. Real estate revenues, which represented 79% of total Move revenues, decreased $33 million, or 23%, driven by the continued impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, including higher household interest rates, which has led to lower lead and transaction volumes. Revenues from the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, and the traditional lead generation product decreased due to these factors, partially offset by improved lead optimization. The referral model generated 23% of total Move revenues in the quarter compared to 28% in the prior year. Based on Move’s internal data, average monthly unique users of Realtor.com®’s web and mobile sites for the fiscal third quarter declined 24% year-over-year to 72 million. Lead volume declined 30%.Subscription Video ServicesRevenues of $477 million in the quarter decreased $17 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, due to a $28 million, or 5%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Revenues of $505 million increased 2% compared to the prior year. Higher revenues from Kayo and BINGE, driven by increases in both volume and pricing, were partially offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 26% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter, as compared to 20% in the prior year.As of March 31, 2023, Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were over 4.5 million, a 6% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to the growth in streaming subscribers driven by BINGE and Kayo, partially offset by lower residential broadcast and commercial subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn in the quarter improved to 12.3%, the lowest level since Fiscal 2016, from 14.3% in the prior year. Broadcast ARPU for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year to A$84 (US$57).As of March 31,20232022(in 000's)Broadcast SubscribersResidential1,3691,522Commercial233240Streaming Subscribers (Total (Paid))Kayo1,332 (1,309 paid)1,209 (1,151 paid)BINGE1,529 (1,484 paid)1,305 (1,212 paid)Foxtel Now178 (171 paid)215 (206 paid)Total Subscribers (Total (Paid))4,662 (4,585 paid)4,509 (4,338 paid)Segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $11 million, or 14%, compared with the prior year, reflecting a $4 million, or 5%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The decline was primarily due to higher sports programming rights costs, driven mainly by contractual increases across AFL, NRL and Cricket Australia, partially offset by lower marketing spend for Kayo and BINGE and lower transmission costs. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 9%.Dow JonesRevenues in the quarter increased $42 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year, which includes $27 million and $19 million contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted Revenues at the Dow Jones segment were flat compared to the prior year, as the growth in circulation and subscription revenues from continued growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products and digital subscription gains was offset by lower advertising revenues. Digital revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter represented 79% of total revenues compared to 76% in the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues increased $49 million, or 13%, which includes the contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Circulation revenue declined 1%, primarily due to lower print volume and lower revenues from IBD, partially offset by the continued growth in digital-only subscriptions, primarily at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues grew 38%, primarily driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products. Revenues from the Risk &amp; Compliance products grew 16%, which includes a 3% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 69% of circulation revenues for the quarter, compared to 68% in the prior year.During the third quarter, total average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached over 5.1 million, a 6% increase compared to the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products grew 10%. Total subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 5% compared to the prior year, to nearly 3.9 million average subscriptions in the quarter. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 9% to 3.3 million average subscriptions in the quarter, and represented 85% of total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.For the three months ended March 31,20232022% Change(in thousands, except %)Better/(Worse)The Wall Street JournalDigital-only subscriptions3,2993,0369 %Total subscriptions3,8883,7185 %Barron’s GroupDigital-only subscriptions96981020 %Total subscriptions1,1281,00812 %Total ConsumerDigital-only subscriptions4,3473,94110 %Total subscriptions5,1174,8486 %Advertising revenues decreased $14 million, or 14%, primarily due to 17% and 8% declines in digital and print advertising revenues, respectively, driven primarily by continued weakness in the technology and finance categories. Digital advertising accounted for 59% of total advertising revenues in the quarter, compared to 62% in the prior year.Segment EBITDA for the quarter increased $21 million, or 24%, which includes a $17 million combined contribution from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. The growth reflects the higher revenues discussed above and the absence of $15 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of OPIS in the prior year, partially offset by $21 million of higher employee costs due to the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and $6 million of higher marketing costs, partly due to the increase in the number of in-person conferences and events. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 11%.Book PublishingRevenues in the quarter were flat with the prior year, as higher sales in Christian books were offset by the $11 million, or 2%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Key titles in the quarter included The Courage to Be Free by Ron DeSantis, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver and Never, Never by Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher. Adjusted Revenues increased 2%. Digital sales declined 3% compared to the prior year due to lower e-book sales. Digital sales represented 23% of Consumer revenues for the quarter and were in-line with the prior year. Backlist sales represented approximately 60% of total revenues in the quarter.Segment EBITDA for the quarter decreased $6 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year, driven by ongoing supply chain, inventory and inflationary pressures on manufacturing, freight and distribution costs. The decline was partially offset by lower employee costs. These pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 7%.News MediaRevenues in the quarter decreased $17 million, or 3%, as compared to the prior year, driven by a $42 million, or 7%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher circulation and subscription and advertising revenues in constant currency. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK decreased 5% and 4%, respectively, as both were impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, revenues at News Corp Australia and News UK increased 1% and 6%, respectively. Adjusted Revenues for the segment increased 4% compared to the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $11 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $21 million, or 8%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower print volume. The decline was partially offset by cover price increases and digital subscriber growth.Advertising revenues decreased $11 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $15 million, or 7%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower digital advertising at News Corp Australia, and lower print advertising at News UK. The decline was partially offset by growth in digital advertising at News UK and higher print advertising at News Corp Australia.In the quarter, Segment EBITDA decreased $5 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year, driven by lower revenues, as discussed above, and reflects a $4 million, or 10%, negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The decline was also due to a $14 million negative impact from higher newsprint prices and approximately $13 million of higher costs related to TalkTV and other digital investments, primarily at News Corp Australia. The Segment EBITDA decline was partially offset by cost saving initiatives. Newsprint, production and distribution costs are expected to be higher in fiscal 2023 than the prior year due to supply chain and inflationary pressures, partially offset by the Company’s continued transition to digital products. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 5%.Digital revenues represented 36% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter, compared to 35% in the prior year, and represented 34% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. Digital subscribers and users across key properties within the News Media segment are summarized below:Closing digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of March 31, 2023 were 1,043,000 (937,000 for news mastheads), compared to 946,000 (876,000 for news mastheads) in the prior year (Source: Internal data)The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including the Times Literary Supplement, as of March 31, 2023 were 494,000, compared to 421,000 in the prior year (Source: Internal data)The Sun’s digital offering reached 199 million global monthly unique users in March 2023, compared to 171 million in the prior year (Source: Google Analytics)New York Post’s digital network reached 147 million unique users in March 2023, compared to 155 million in the prior year (Source: Google Analytics)CASH FLOWThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation:For the nine months endedMarch 31,20232022(in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$670$1,030Less: Capital expenditures(350)(315)Free cash flow320715Less: REA Group free cash flow(153)(184)Plus: Cash dividends received from REA Group9187Free cash flow available to News Corporation$258$618Net cash provided by operating activities of $670 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was $360 million lower than $1,030 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower Total Segment EBITDA, as noted above, and higher working capital, partially offset by lower restructuring and tax payments.Free cash flow in the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was $320 million compared to $715 million in the prior year. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was $258 million compared to $618 million in the prior year period. The decrease in both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation was primarily due to lower cash provided by operating activities, as mentioned above, and higher capital expenditures. Foxtel’s capital expenditures for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 were $118 million compared to $125 million in the prior year.Free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and free cash flow available to News Corporation is defined as free cash flow, less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group.The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation, which adjusts free cash flow to exclude REA Group’s free cash flow and include dividends received from REA Group, provides management and investors with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Company’s unadjusted free cash flow. A limitation of both free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is that they do not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.COMPARISON OF NON-GAAP TO U.S. GAAP INFORMATIONAdjusted Revenues, Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Segment EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders, Adjusted EPS, constant currency revenues, free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation are non-GAAP financial measures contained in this earnings release. The Company believes these measures are important tools for investors and analysts to use in assessing the Company’s underlying business performance and to provide for more meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance between periods. These measures also allow investors and analysts to view the Company’s business from the same perspective as Company management. These non-GAAP measures may be different than similar measures used by other companies and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the differences between non-GAAP measures used in this earnings release and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are included in Notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and free cash flow available to News Corporation is included above.Conference callNews Corporation’s earnings conference call can be heard live at 5:00 p.m. EDT on May 11, 2023.

Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods. The following tables reconcile net income to Total Segment EBITDA for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:For the three months ended March 31,20232022Change% Change(in millions)Net income$59$104$(45)(43)%Add:Income tax expense3229310%Other, net(14)(13)(1)(8)%Interest expense, net2525——%Equity losses of affiliates1046**Impairment and restructuring charges2537(12)(32)%Depreciation and amortization183172116%Total Segment EBITDA$320$358$(38)(11)%** - Not meaningfulFor the nine months ended March 31,20232022Change% Change(in millions)Net income$219$633$(414)(65)%Add:Income tax expense128199(71)(36)%Other, net10(143)153**Interest expense, net78681015%Equity losses of affiliates431033**Impairment and restructuring charges6582(17)(21)%Depreciation and amortization536505316%Total Segment EBITDA$1,079$1,354$(275)(20)%** - Not meaningfulNOTE 2 – ADJUSTED REVENUES, ADJUSTED TOTAL SEGMENT EBITDA AND ADJUSTED SEGMENT EBITDAThe Company uses revenues, Total Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, fees and costs, net of indemnification, related to the claims and investigations arising out of certain conduct at The News of the World (the ""U.K. Newspaper Matters""), charges for other significant, non-ordinary course legal or regulatory matters (""litigation charges"") and foreign currency fluctuations (""Adjusted Revenues,"" ""Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA"" and ""Adjusted Segment EBITDA,"" respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company’s core business operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period such as the unpredictability and volatility of currency fluctuations. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.The calculation of Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment. Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for amounts determined under GAAP as measures of performance. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company’s historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to investors to assist in their analysis of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors.The following tables reconcile reported revenues and reported Total Segment EBITDA to Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Total Segment

Matters, litigation charges, impairment and restructuring charges and ""Other, net"", net of tax, recognized by the Company or its equity method investees, as well as the settlement of certain pre-Separation tax matters (""adjusted net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders"" and ""adjusted EPS,"" respectively), to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, as well as certain non-operational items. The calculation of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for consolidated net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders and net income (loss) per share as determined under GAAP as a measure of performance. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company’s historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to investors to assist in their analysis of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors.The following tables reconcile reported net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders and reported diluted EPS to adjusted net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders and adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:For the three months endedMarch 31, 2023For the three months endedMarch 31, 2022(in millions, except per share data)Net income attributable to stockholdersEPSNet income attributable to stockholdersEPSNet income$59$104Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(9)(22)Net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders$50$0.09$82$0.14U.K. Newspaper Matters40.0130.01Impairment and restructuring charges (a)250.04370.05Other, net(14)(0.03)(13)(0.02)Tax impact on items above(12)(0.02)(17)(0.03)Impact of noncontrolling interest on items above——40.01As adjusted$53$0.09$96$0.16(a)During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $15 million related to the write-down of fixed assets associated with the shutdown and sale of certain U.S. printing facilities at the Dow Jones segment.For the nine months endedMarch 31, 2023For the nine months endedMarch 31, 2022(in millions, except per share data)Net income attributable to stockholdersEPSNet income attributable to stockholdersEPSNet income$219$633Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(62)(120)Net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders$157$0.27$513$0.86U.K. Newspaper Matters130.0290.02Impairment and restructuring charges (a)650.11820.14Equity losses of affiliates (b)——30.01Other, net100.02(143)(0.24)Tax impact on items above(39)(0.07)(15)(0.03)Impact of noncontrolling interest on items above(1)—450.07As adjusted$205$0.35$494$0.83(a)During the nine months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $15 million related to the write-down of fixed assets associated with the shutdown and sale of certain U.S. printing facilities at the Dow Jones segment.(b)During the nine months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge related to an equity method investment.NOTE 4 – CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUESThe Company believes that the presentation of revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations (""constant currency revenues"") provides useful information regarding the performance of the Company’s core business operations exclusive of distortions between periods caused by the unpredictability and volatility of currency fluctuations. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as described in Note 2.Constant currency revenues are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for revenues as determined under GAAP as measures of performance.

Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband brings power and performance comparable to a wired broadband internet connection to customers’ pockets.Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband enables people to do things on their mobile device that many could only do before when connected to their home internet service. This includes everything from downloading huge documents and streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats, video conferencing and FaceTime calls with clear sound and video.“Verizon’s expansion into more rural markets across West Virginia will bring enhanced connectivity across our great state,” said West Virginia Senate President and Lieutenant Governor Craig Blair. “Verizon’s investment in 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout West Virginia will mean even greater benefits and possibilities to residents and visitors in West Virginia.”“Verizon is widely known for having an extremely reliable 5G network experience, and it’s exciting to see the positive impact our work has had in West Virginia,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our network engineers work tirelessly to provide unmatched connectivity to our customers across Huntington, Morgantown, Fairmont and Bridgeport and beyond, and we will not slow down.”Network enhancements in West Virginia These deployments use Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon will deploy 5G Ultra Wideband using 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum in multiple West Virginia markets, and will add even more bandwidth once all of its licensed spectrum is made available. This additional bandwidth, which will be available at the end of this year, will provide exceptional speed and capacity.Story continuesLastly, the addition of 5G service in West Virginia will result in exponential increases in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community, which requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Get the most of our 5G Ultra WidebandFor customers in West Virginia, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we delivered strong revenue, margin and earnings growth in the third quarter, significantly outpacing expectations. This demonstrates the power of brand building, customer centricity and our agile operating model. Importantly, we continue to advance our long-term strategic agenda, creating lasting customer relationships around the world through product innovation and compelling omni-channel experiences. A testament to the ingenuity of our talented global teams who continue to drive our results.Touching on the strategic and financial highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth achieving 9% constant currency revenue gains, meaningfully surpassing our outlook. These top line results were led by our international businesses, which grew nearly 20% excluding FX. This included a greater-than-anticipated inflection in Greater China, where sales increased 20%, supported by a strong rebound in traffic and returning to growth compared to the region's peak fiscal '21 levels. Importantly, given our history in the market and the brand building investments we've made, our brands are well positioned to capture the opportunity with the Chinese consumer, both in Greater China and around the world.In the quarter, we also drove continued momentum in Japan and other Asia with sales growth of over 20% as well as a mid-single-digit increase in Europe. In North America, sales rose low single digits against an increasingly challenging consumer backdrop. Of note, these results benefited from growth in January as we anniversaried more acute COVID-related disruptions in the prior year. Taken together, we delivered strong sales growth globally, while driving higher growth and operating margins compared to prior year, underscoring our commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands and business.Second, we continue to build lasting customer relationships. During the quarter, we acquired over 1.2 million new customers in North America alone. Importantly, these new customers transacted at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base and approximately half of these customers were Millennial and Gen Z, consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers to our brands. At the same time, we reactivated lapsed customers across the portfolio.Third, we delivered seamless omni-channel experiences, harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. We drove 10% growth in direct-to-consumer sales on a constant currency basis. This was led by low-teens growth in brick-and-mortar sales as we welcome an increasing number of consumers to our stores. In addition, digital sales rose mid-single digits and remained over 3x ahead of pre-pandemic levels.Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence informed by data, analytics and consumer research. To this end, we drove handbag AUR growth globally and in North America, which supported our gross margin increases in the quarter. We also delivered outsized gains in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, key to enhancing brand relevance and fueling customer value over time. Taken together, we generated third quarter earnings well above our expectations, rising over 50% compared to the prior year which we accomplished despite a volatile demand backdrop and currency headwinds. Based on this performance, we are raising our outlook for the fiscal year, underscoring our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth.Now turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. We outperformed expectations in the third quarter as we continue to build strength on strength. We drove an 11% revenue increase at constant currency, while delivering over 300 basis points of operating margin expansion fueled by gross margin gains. Throughout the quarter, we advanced our strategic initiatives, bringing expressive luxury to life.First, we built on the momentum of our leather goods offering, extending our iconic families to drive consumer engagement. Tabby was again a top performer, resonating with both new and existing customers with notable success in the core shoulder bag. During the quarter, we launched new styles, including the Tabby Box bag, which provided silhouette diversification as well as the fun and nostalgic Jelly tabby, which drove strong sell-through specifically with younger consumers. In the Road family, our top handle silhouette gained momentum, becoming the #1 style within the collection. At the same time, Willow drove significant volume while Bandit outperformed expectations at elevated price points. In addition, we're creating compelling and emotional small leather goods assortment. As a result, we drove outsized growth in the category aided by success across wallets and micro bags in keeping with current trends.Overall, our product innovation supported by the use of data and consumer insights throughout the product creation process fueled a high single-digit global handbag AUR growth at constant currency, including gains in North America. Second, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities, connecting emotionally with customers through the unique purpose of the brand. Building on Coach's courage to be real mission, we debuted our latest marketing that connects product and purpose. Our In My Tabby campaign featuring Lil Nas X, alongside a cast of global brand ambassadors redefines what we carry, not just in terms of physical objects but the experiences, journeys and aspirations that shape who we are.Importantly, our 360-degree activation efforts supported the acquisition of approximately 800,000 new customers in North America alone, with over half being Millennial or Gen Z. We also drove strong engagement with existing clientele and reactivated lapsed customers, reaffirming our ability to attract new customers while retaining our existing customer base. And in China, we drove strong growth and brand momentum, capitalizing on Coach's leadership positioning and track record of success since entering the market 2 decades ago. During the quarter, we were pleased with the performance of our collaboration with the Nostalgic White Rabbit Candy brand, which debuted a celebration of Lunar New Year. This collection successfully drove the acquisition of new customers with over half of its purchasers being new to the brand.Third, we drove a strong top line increase in our lifestyle offering, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In ready-to-wear, we delivered outsized growth with success across genders as we leaned into the key branding elements. This performance was led by our compelling outerwear selection anchored by the brand's iconic trench. In men's, double-digit constant currency gains were fueled by our leather goods offering, aided by the continued strength of our Gotham family as well as the successful launch of the relay tote offered in a range of colors and featuring Coach New York graphics.Fourth, we created omni-channel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand purpose of self-expression. We tested new experiential and immersive retail concepts across the globe, creating opportunities for customers to engage their senses throughout their brand and product discovery journeys. In Chicago, we launched Coach Play, the first in a series of concept stores, encouraging customers to play in coach spaces. These highly interactive locations, which we have since opened in Japan and Singapore, are bespoke, balancing design elements of the brand's heritage with local elements to connect with each store's community.Further, we leaned into the success of our Tabby family to create Tabby shops in select stores around the world. These compelling environments utilize existing store architecture and were inspired by traditional ice cream shops to celebrate the different flavors of this iconic handbag collection. We also showcased these pop-ups across our digital channels, allowing the brand to scale the experience to a broader audience. And just last month, we were excited to officially launch Coachtopia, a sub-brand created with the goal of reimagining and disrupting the fashion industry. By working with a community of partners, including Gen Zs, we kept circularity as our North Star, delivering a line of products crafted from reused leather bags and recycled materials.While a small assortment today, we are extremely pleased with the response to the product and purpose and see further opportunity ahead. In closing, Coach continues to differentiate both in its brand positioning and its financial performance. This success is rooted in the brand's magic. Its unique DNA and iconic product offerings, blended with the logic of deep customer understanding. Importantly, through expressive luxury, we're writing Coach's next chapter by connecting our history and purpose with innovative product and experiences, enabling self-expression for modern consumers around the world. We are confident in our strategy and the opportunity to deliver continued healthy growth for years to come.Now moving to Kate Spade. Our third quarter results outpaced expectations, supported by revenue gains on a constant currency basis and gross margin expansion. At the same time, we made further foundational investments that are supporting our long-term strategic growth agenda. Positioning the brand to be more emotional, more lifestyle and more global in order to drive customer connectivity and deliver profitable growth. Touching on the details of the quarter. First, we remain focused on delivering an innovative and distinctive core handbag offering. The Knott remained the top global handbag group, while the recently introduced Hudson, which features wear-to-work styles was a recruitment driver for younger consumers.In addition, the iconic sandbag offered in recycled nylon drove strong growth. The success of this family highlights the opportunity to engage consumers by leaning into the brand heritage and innovation. We also amplified our novelty offering, bringing heightened emotion and newness to the brand. The sheepdog collection resonated with both new and existing customers. In fact, this was the #1 full-price novelty style in the quarter, priced at nearly $500. Overall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported low single-digit handbag AUR growth at constant currency, both globally and in North America.Next, we advanced our strategy to become more lifestyle, delivering strong revenue growth in the assortment, led by momentum in ready-to-wear, footwear and jewelry. Importantly, we continue to see that customers who shop across categories are our highest value customers, demonstrating the importance of the brand's lifestyle offering as a long-term growth driver.Now touching on marketing. We expressed the world of Kate Spade through unique storytelling. In celebration of the brand's 30th anniversary, we leaned into its DNA as a beloved lifestyle brand that sparks Joy. To do this, we increased our top of funnel marketing spend, targeting Millennial and Gen Z consumers to support the reimagination of our heritage codes. Stripes, dots and Kate Spade Green, which we launched in partnership with Pantone. This signature shade, which was featured an exclusive capsule across categories as well as updated recyclable and reusable packaging has been particularly successful with the brand's loyal fan base.We're also continuing to engage with consumers through our social impact effort, which connects our customers to our brand beyond products. Taken together, our impactful marketing helped fuel the recruitment of approximately 400,000 new customers in North America. Additionally, we saw strong lapsed customer reactivation and an overall increase in spend per customer.And finally, in keeping with our priority is becoming more global, we remain focused on meeting our target consumer where they shop around the world. To this end, we continue to roll out our new store concept, which began with Marina Bay Sands in Singapore in October. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to more than 15 doors across the globe, creating a compelling brand experience. And in Greater China, an area of opportunity for the brand, we launched Lunar New Year capsule collections, pop-ups and WeChat activations featuring our rabbit novelty offering, which drove strong engagement.In addition, we collaborated with Starbucks China on a series of limited time-only merchandise to help build Kate Spade's brand awareness and excitement. The capsule had strong sell-throughs with more than half of the assortment selling out in just 2 days, signaling the brand's appeal to a broad base of Chinese consumers.In summary, we continue to make progress in advancing the brand's, strategic growth agenda and see further opportunity ahead. Kate Spade is a unique lifestyle brand with global relevance, and we're making key investments to deepen consumer engagement through compelling products, marketing and experiences to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement over the long term.Turning to Stuart Weitzman. In the third quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth in constant currency, supported by double-digit growth in North America and a mid-single-digit increase in Greater China. Importantly, we achieved this top line performance while significantly expanding margins with higher full price selling driving gross margin gains.Turning to the details of the quarter. We made further progress on our strategy to win with heat and improve brand awareness. First, we curated a highly relevant assortment of emotional product to spark desire. Our newer iconic families led our results with notable outperformance in pumps, booties and loafers. Soho was again a top collection, anchored by the on-trend Luxol which saw a strong performance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, while the Stewart family continued to grow and resonated across age groups. And our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment, drove engagement with both new and existing clients at high AUR and accretive margins.Second, we focused on creating compelling shopping experiences across the globe. As a result, we drove revenue growth in our global direct business, led by increases in North America, which included significant growth in digital. We also continue to strengthen our wholesale partnerships. Specifically, in North America, we saw an increase in sales at full price accounts while continuing to reduce off-price exposure as we focus on brand elevation. And internationally, we delivered continued growth as we increased our presence across key accounts.Third, we fueled brand heat by leveraging new marketing tactics to increase buzz and organic awareness. This included an influencer back campaign with a compelling styling series to highlight our spring collection. In addition, we were pleased with the performance of our limited edition collection with KidSuper, a New York City-based streetwear brand and creative studio, which featured artistic plays on our icons that reach new customers across the globe at higher-than-average AUR. As a result of our focus on connecting with consumers in new ways, we drove an increase in the number of active customers in the quarter, fueled by engagement with our existing client base, including growth in reactivated customers.Overall, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives to drive brand heat and awareness while maintaining financial and operational rigor to further support profitable growth. In closing, our third quarter results reinforce our progress in differentiating our brands and business. Although the environment remains uncertain, we operate in attractive durable categories from a position of strength with iconic brands amplified by a digitally enabled platform that powers them to move at the speed of the consumer. We remain steadfast in our commitment to building enduring brands and relationships with consumers, and we're investing behind these priorities.At the same time, we're being agile and disciplined financial operators. Controlling what we can control to successfully navigate the near term while advancing our long-term strategic growth agenda. Our runway is significant, and we have a relentless drive to deliver sustainable growth and value for all stakeholders.With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '23 outlook. Scott?Scott A. RoeThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, we delivered significant top and bottom line outperformance.In the quarter, we drove revenue growth of 9% on a constant currency basis, including 20% growth internationally. We expanded operating margin by approximately 280 basis points versus last year, led by gross margin gains and grew earnings per share by over 50%. Importantly, we also returned $270 million to shareholders, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing long-term value.Turning to the details of the quarter, I'll begin with revenue, which will be shared on a constant currency basis. Sales rose 9%, well ahead of our expectations for an increase of 3% to 5% fueled by games both internationally and in North America. In Greater China, we returned to revenue growth in the quarter, driven by an improvement in traffic. Sales increased 20% with double-digit gains across stores, digital and wholesale. At the same time, we've started to see an uptick in domestic Chinese travel, including significant gains in our Hong Kong and Macau businesses as well as a pickup in Hainan. Importantly, although these initial reads have been encouraging, global Chinese tourist trends still remain well below pre-pandemic levels, representing an area of further opportunity.In Japan, sales rose approximately 23%, while Other Asia grew 22%, driven by strength across Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, with notable traction among local consumers. Sales to tourists also improved versus the prior year, although remained well below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, sales increased 4%, fueled by gains with international tourists, notably from the Middle East. And in North America, sales rose 3%, driven by growth in January against last year's atypical comparisons related to COVID.For the balance of the quarter and into April, trends in the region softened amid an increasingly challenging consumer backdrop. As such, we've incorporated a mid-single-digit decline in sales in North America into our fourth quarter outlook. By channel, our direct-to-consumer business grew 10%, led by a low-teens gain in stores as well as a mid-single-digit increase in digital. Importantly, we delivered higher operating margin in both channels relative to last year. And in wholesale, revenue was 7% below the prior year, reflecting growth in the international markets, fully offset by a decline in North America, which included a strategic reduction in off-price shipments.Moving down the P&amp;L. We delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 290 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 360 basis points of favorable freight expense, partially offset by 120 basis points of FX headwinds. Therefore, excluding these impacts, gross margin was still ahead of the prior year, fueled by operational outperformance based on AUR increases, promotional discipline and a tailwind related to the increased penetration of higher-margin China business.SG&amp;A rose 5% compared to the prior year and included approximately $10 million of timing benefit with the fourth quarter. Throughout the quarter, we continued to prioritize high-return initiatives, including platform investments and brand building activities. Taken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of our forecast and ahead of prior year. As a result, our third quarter EPS was approximately $0.20 ahead of our forecast, primarily due to $0.10 of operational outperformance as well as a favorable timing shift of $0.05 with the fourth quarter and roughly $0.05 associated with below-the-line benefits.Overall, we delivered earnings growth of over 50% despite $0.10 of year-over-year FX headwinds.Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $652 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.67 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $71 million including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $57 million. Inventory levels for the quarter ended 2% ahead of prior year, favorable to our expectations on higher sales and tight inventory control. Given this performance, we're now well positioned to end the fiscal year with inventory approximately flat to last year as we continue to focus on higher inventory turn while delivering gross margin expansion.Moving to our capital allocation priorities. We continue to plan for approximately $1 billion in shareholder returns in fiscal 2023, which consists of share repurchases of $700 million including $500 million repurchased fiscal year-to-date as planned and dividend payments totaling approximately $300 million. This is based on an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share which represents a 20% increase over the prior year.Our priorities remain unchanged. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the future, we believe our platform is scalable and would evaluate M&amp;A that is accretive to our organic TSR plan.So moving to guidance. We're raising our fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings outlook, which reflects our outperformance in the third quarter of $0.15, excluding the impact of timing. Let's touch on the details of this outlook, which replaces all previous guidance. For the fiscal year, we expect constant currency revenue growth of approximately 3%. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to approach $6.7 billion, which is in the area of prior year and includes roughly 320 basis points of FX pressure. This implies constant currency revenue growth of approximately low single digits in the fourth quarter, excluding FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points.Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, our guidance continues to contemplate a low single-digit decline for the year. As previously noted, this implies a mid-single-digit sales decline in the fourth quarter based on the increasingly challenging backdrop we're seeing. This also reflects our commitment to maintaining promotional discipline and higher margins as we manage our brands and our business for the long term. In Greater China, given the third quarter's outperformance, we anticipate a mid-single-digit gain for the fiscal year which includes an increase of approximately 50% in the fourth quarter.In Japan, we expect to grow mid-teens, while other Asia is forecasted to grow 40%. And in Europe, we anticipate a high single-digit sales increase. In addition, our outlook includes a year-over-year operating margin decline in the area of 50 basis points, which assumes FX pressure of roughly 115 basis points. We expect the majority of this FX headwind to flow through the gross margin line. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 100 basis points ahead of the prior year, largely reflecting the operational beat in the third quarter and the expectation for continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter.For the full year, our gross margin forecast incorporates the benefit of moderating freight costs of 140 basis points as well as AUR growth, which is being partially offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials as well as the negative impact of FX, as mentioned. On SG&amp;A expenses, we anticipate deleverage for the year, reflecting growth-driving initiatives, including increased marketing expenses to fuel long-term customer value, investments in digital and the opening of our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas, partially offset by proactive actions we've taken to reduce our expense base.Moving to below the line items. Net interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $30 million, a significant decline versus fiscal '22, reflecting the benefit of our cross-currency swap agreements. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19%, which is below our prior forecast given the lower actualization in the third quarter due primarily to geographic mix. Weighted average diluted share count is expected to be in the area of 242 million shares. This reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases expected in the fiscal year as noted. Taken together, we project EPS of $3.85 to $3.90, representing a low double-digit growth rate compared with the prior year which includes a year-over-year currency headwind of approximately $0.40.For the fourth quarter, this guidance implies earnings of $0.92 to $0.97, inclusive of the $0.05 timing impact with the third quarter. Finally, we now forecast CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $280 million. We expect approximately 30% of this spend to be related to openings and renovations with the majority of the balance dedicated to our ongoing digital and IT initiatives, including investments related to our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.In closing, we delivered strong third quarter results with sales, margin and earnings growth all outpacing expectations, positioning us to raise our top and bottom line outlook for the fiscal year. In addition, we remain on track to return $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23, highlighting the power of our balance sheet and significant free cash flow generation. Importantly, our performance underscores our competitive advantages and reinforces our strategic agenda.As we look forward, we remain focused on staying agile and discipline to deliver against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns. I'd now like to open it up and take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulCan you discuss a little more in detail the demand backdrop that you're facing in North America and in China, how this impacts your view of the opportunity from here?Joanne C. CrevoiseratWell, we did deliver a solid quarter, which reinforces our confidence in our strategy and showcases the benefits of our globally diversified business and our direct-to-consumer business model. And I want to take a minute before I start to recognize our teams around the world who continue to drive our results.We are pleased not only in our top line growth, but the significant gross margin expansion we delivered and we're deliberately managing our brands and our business for the long term. In North America, results in the third quarter were better than expected, although the trends did soften as the quarter progressed and that continued into April. The backdrop is increasingly challenging, and we are seeing a more cautious consumer. We've incorporated this trend into our guidance for Q4. What you've seen in the third quarter is we're committed to being disciplined financial operators with a focus on driving healthy growth, both with a focus on margins and brand health. Conversely, our business in China is accelerating. As Scott mentioned, we drove double-digit growth in stores, online and in wholesale in the quarter. And importantly, at a constant currency basis, we're growing above our previous peak from FY '21. And I think another important fact is that we're building momentum with strong growth across the balance of Asia. And that business is now also about 15% of our total business.And I just got back from being in China and Southeast Asia, and I am so impressed with our teams and how they've navigated the challenges in the environment. We've been in China with Coach, as you know, for 2 decades, and our teams are a differentiator. I saw this clearly during our travels. And it's a real competitive advantage for us. It's setting our brands apart, they're delivering innovation and connecting with our customers. And the confidence we have in our performance gives us long-term confidence.Over the last 3 years, we've proven our ability to drive earnings growth in the face of a dynamic environment and headwinds in the market. The third quarter was no different. Our performance, I think, highlights our strength -- the strength of our globally diversified business, again, in our direct-to-consumer business model, and it showcases the strength of our brands around the world. We'll continue to build on this strength, and we see tremendous runway ahead across our portfolio.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.Irwin Bernard BoruchowI guess maybe for Joanne and Scott, I wanted to ask, you've had several quarters under your belt now since your Analyst Day, you had the $8 billion target with $5 plus of earnings by '25. Can you maybe just comment on your thoughts on those targets at this point. Clearly, the revenue run rate has been below, well you guys had hoped for, even though it is accelerating, which is great, but the margins seem like they have been better. So just trying to see confidence on both those top and bottom line expectations that you guys laid out multiyear.Joanne C. CrevoiseratI'll let Scott unpack the numbers for you, but we are gaining confidence in our strategy every quarter we deliver in over the last 3 years. But certainly, since our Investor Day, our teams continue to deliver on the priorities we laid out. And you can see by our results in the beaten rates we deliver today that those strategies are working, but I'll pass it to Scott, on targets?Scott A. RoeYes, sure. Thanks, Joanne. Yes, we recently made comments around our confidence in the $5 plus EPS target that we laid out in our Investor Day, and we tell you a little bit why we had that confident in right? It's been a volatile and certain demand environment, and we're really focused on the things we can control, and there are certain things we can't.But we're -- we said it repeatedly, we're not chasing the last dollar. We're being disciplined. And I think this year is a great testament to that. It certainly developed differently than we thought. But when we look at the way in which we're operating, the strong gross margin performance, coupled with our inventories being in great shape. It's evidence of strong discipline, the pricing power of the brand. And we continue to invest in growth longer term. And at the same time, using the great insight we have the 90% direct-to-consumer and that data. We're really rigorous on the returns on those investments and making sure that they're paying off and that they're driving future quality growth.So you put these things together, and you're right, it's hard to see what the demand is going to look like, but we're gaining more and more confidence in our ability to deliver earnings just as we did this year, and we see that discipline being an even more important differentiator going forward.Now a little bit about maybe the shape of that, just to help you, you're probably doing some modeling here, and many of you are, we would expect our path to $5 to be a little more weighted to '25 versus '24. And the reason for that is we've seen moderated North American performance, but we're a global diversified model, and we're seeing an acceleration in China. So you put those together, we see a little more back-weighted in '25.OperatorWe'll move next to Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonHas the promotional stance changed at all as trends fueled in North America? And what is your outlook for AUR and price increases over the next several quarters?Joanne C. CrevoiseratWell, Lorraine, the promotional environment exists. It always exists. I think we see an active promotional environment in the context of doing business in North America. But we have been very disciplined, in terms of how we think about our brands and our -- how we go to market. We continue to see pricing power across our portfolio. We delivered AUR gains and gross margin increases across the portfolio, and we expect that to continue. It really starts with great product, and our teams are innovating and delivering compelling products that consumers desire.We're achieving and exceeding our revenue targets on higher gross margins again across the portfolio, which is evidence that being close to the consumer and delivering this product, it's working. We're going to remain agile. We do see further opportunity for AUR gains and gross margin growth. I think I'll probably kick it to Todd, who is Coach brand, which is further on the journey here to driving AUR gains and really understanding the customer and managing the business extremely well. So Todd, I'll let you add some color...Todd KahnThank you, Joanne. And in the last 3 years, I've been waiting for that nonpromotional environment to come about. I haven't yet seen it.What we have seen is in the last 3 years, we've increased our AUR by 30%. And I'm optimistic about the continued growth of our AUR at Coach for 4 main reasons. First, our innovation and storytelling, particularly when we talk about handbags and SLGs. I think what you saw this last year since we've created expressive luxury is taking our purpose campaign and tying it to an actual product. And that is a differentiator from us and maybe our close-in competitors.Second, something we've talked about quite a bit, emotion always trumps price. And when you look at the small bag phenomenon that we've experienced some of our highest fares, particularly in our value channel, command some of the smallest bags commanding the highest AUR. So we feel very good about that. Third, the white space that exists today between traditional European luxury, where Coach play is the largest we've ever experienced. So that gives us a lot of room to continue to show the consumer the value of our products.And finally, something that both Joanne and Scott talk about quite a bit is our tight inventory control. Since we started our innovation and our transformation 3 years ago, we cut out about 50% -- almost 50% of our SKU count. That allows us to focus meaningfully on key family, which reduces the liability that we had historically had to carry. So I think those 4 things combined gives me a lot of confidence that we still have a way to go on AUR growth.And as Scott said, we're not chasing top line. We are securing our margins, building a new customer base who are transacting at higher AURs.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Joanne, how would you assess if we take a step back, overall health of the handbags and accessories category globally today? And can you help walk through the functional drivers of the sustainable category growth that we've seen if you look back historically?And then, Scott, maybe could you just speak to the profitability balance with investments that you're clearly striking, or any constraints that you see to executing against the multiyear double-digit earnings growth target that you've laid out?Joanne C. CrevoiseratYes. Let me start with the handbag category. It is a resilient and durable category. And it has historically grown in that mid-to-high single-digit level for years. And it has proven, the category has proven going to be durable through downturns. And I think there are a couple of reasons that drive that.One, the consumers have an emotional connection to this category, and we continue to get closer and closer to our consumers, particularly new and younger consumers coming into the market. To understand their needs and to appeal for both the emotional drivers of that category as well as the functional drivers of the category. There's a lot written about goods and services and where consumers are spending their money. But the handbag and leather goods category is a category that consumers use in all aspects of their lives. We saw demand even when people were locked in at home, and there was -- our stores were closed and people were going nowhere.And then as the world reopened and people were going to social occasions and traveling more, going back to work, we saw a resurgence in demand and the resilience as people bring our products with them on those occasions. So I think the durability of the category speaks to both the emotional connection that consumers have as well as the functional needs that we support across all aspects of their life.And the journey that we've been on in terms of brand building, it's really understanding the consumers' journey. We continue to leverage data to get deeper and deeper into those use occasions and their journeys and their needs emotionally and functionally and that's how we continue to deliver and deliver with pricing power.As we look forward, we do a lot of research. There is still strong intent to spend in the category as we go forward. So we expect the trends to continue.And then the second of your question....Scott A. RoeYes, building on the second part. I think just going back to what Todd said earlier, it's -- our model right now and how we think about the trade-offs of profit and investment. We're not getting profit through SG&amp;A cuts, right? We're getting it through quality growth.And Todd's comment about leaning into engagement versus price, the discipline that goes around that, getting price increases driving those gross margins. That's why we're so focused on gross margins. that allows us to both continue to invest in the business and drive that emotional connection and at the same time, deliver profitability.And just finally, linking back to what I said before, we're being really rigorous about making sure we're getting these investments. And some things work and we lean in, some things don't work, and we're quick to cut them off. And I think that's just the evidence of when we say disciplined operators. We're really looking at this with a lot of rigor right now.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachJoanne, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on the changes that you saw in the North American consumer and their engagement with the brands in the back half of the quarter. What did you see in terms of traffic and conversion among various demographic cohorts? And then perhaps as a follow-up, how is customer acquisition and retention trending for Coach brand among the consumers that have been acquired since the acceleration strategy began?Joanne C. CrevoiseratSo in terms of what we're seeing in North America, we're seeing the trends and the softness really more broad-based. So we're not seeing it targeted to any one specific consumer group. As we look across our business.And as you may know, our brands and our customer average household income is around that $100,000 mark, and that's true across channels. And so what we saw in the quarter was just a generally more cautious consumer. And we are managing our business responsibly and to drive brand health. So continue to see pricing power within that context, but just a more cautious consumer overall. And that's what we've embedded in our guidance as we go forward so that we have realistic expectations about what the market is providing.We're managing a global business. So we are seeing strength in other parts of our business. We have the agility to respond to those differing demand trends and continue to manage our business in a healthy way. So our outlook, and we raised our outlook shows that in our expectation for increased margin, continuing gross margins and continuing in Q4. So that's how we're thinking about the consumer and how we're managing our business. On consumer acquisition at Coach, yes, I'll pass it to Todd, maybe give you some color on that.Todd KahnYes. Thank you, Joanne. What we said this last quarter, we acquired over 800,000 new customers in North America alone. And if you look back at the last, almost a year, our customer acquisition is really doing quite well. And what we're seeing is our strategy of focusing in a younger Millennial and Gen Z consumer is working.About half of the new customers are that younger cohort. Interestingly, they are transacting at higher AURs. So it is a self-fulfilling benefit to us. Additionally, what is important is we're retaining our existing customers. we're not firing our current customers. So we welcome everyone in the Coach family. But what I'd love to hear is, not only is it my brand for my mom, it's a brand for me now. And that's what we're hearing more and more and that's what's exciting. And that's what gives us confidence that our strategy is working.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver ChenCoachtopia you have a lot of great underpinning there. I would love your thoughts on materials innovation and sustainability and how that may scale to Coach at large? And any details on cost of goods sold are longer and near-term implications for margin profile there?And then as you speak to North America, you could speak to outlet relative to full price, any trends we should know about? And also your outlet channel continues to seem very vibrant (inaudible) as well as utilizing personalization and the customer data platform to drive differentiation and innovation. Just looked ahead with thinking about outlet and maintaining that and how yield balance the execution there relative to full price.Todd KahnI was worried. I wasn't going to get my quota of questions for Coach, but clearly, we have achieved that now based on that. Joanne, I guess I'll take this and then you. Give some views on everything else. So Oliver, you're right about Coachtopia. It's been an overnight success, 2 years in the making. And we are very proud of what we've accomplished with Coachtopia.And what we started off was this idea that both Coach and Tapestry do incredible work on sustainability, but we were always getting full credit for it. So we wanted to create a sub-brand that highlighted those efforts. We also recognized there was an opportunity to co-create with Gen Z and Millennials. And today, we have a community over -- a community of over 120 Coachtopians who are inspiring us and providing key input on the development of the product. We will be scaling Coachtopia.I'd like to say this is not a vanity project, but we will be -- but it will become a large and profitable business. And you're exactly right in calling out that the concept of Coachtopia is to take learning that we've developed in product and material and usage of waste and applying those into coach. And over the longterm, that will have an absolute benefit in reducing our COGS. And so we're excited by that opportunity.In outlet and in North America, I think it's key that we must and will continue to innovate product offerings and ideas through all of our channels. And we're seeing that. We're seeing great results in both brick-and-mortar outlet and outlet.com in North America as well as our full price business. And one of the things we've talked about in the past is our most valued customers in their lifetime value are those who shop in all 4 quadrants of our business. So we will continue to use data. We've experimented as Joanne said, both of us just came back from Asia. One of the things we're doing so well in Asia is the outlet stores are some of the most beautiful, compelling stores in our fleet. We've put in Tabby product, full price, no discounting, and it's driving real sales there. So we're taking some of those learnings and applying them in the U.S. One of the opportunities is we've grown on both coach.com and coachoutlet.com, is that we see the consumer cross-shopping in a beneficial way.So this opportunity, if a client of ours comes into a Coach outlet looking for Tabby, we want to satisfy that demand. So it's very exciting. I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow both channels very profitably.Scott A. RoeTodd, yes, just to build on that, Oliver, too, just -- you asked a little bit about differentiation in channels, if I understood it right. We don't really see any material trend differences between retail or outlet across Tapestry, just for your information.Oliver ChenJust a quick follow-up on China. There's a lot of momentum there, but there's also at some retailers some conversion issues. So what do you see happening with the evolution of mainland consumption versus abroad? And there are some limitations with this and slight capacity. So would love your thoughts about what's embedded in guidance and perhaps risk factors that may or may not be out of your control?Joanne C. CrevoiseratLet me kick it off here, but we're winning in China, and we are seeing and able to capture momentum in the domestic market in China. And again, we talked about double-digit increase across all channels. We have a very strong brick-and-mortar presence in the market and 2 decades of experience in the market with understanding consumers. We've built a digital business and are on multiple platforms as we follow the consumer in the market.So we feel very well positioned to meet and deliver -- meet that demand and deliver for customers in the market. To your point, we're seeing some shifts as they come out of the COVID restrictions. We're seeing more domestic travel. So we're capturing more business in Hong Kong, Macau, and in Hainan, which is a strong businesses for us. We have yet to see a resumption of international travel at the levels that it was pre-pandemic.But again, we're driving significant growth in Southeast Asia, which is a market that the Chinese consumer used to travel to quite a bit. We're seeing and delivering significant growth today with a more domestic consumer. And we're well positioned in that market to capture the international inbound Chinese consumer as that unfolds as well as in Europe and in North America. So those trends have changed. We're not back to pre-pandemic levels of travel. We're capturing the demand we see in the mainland based on our deep experience there. And we are well positioned in the rest of the world as those international travel trends improve.OperatorAnd we'll take our final question from Mark Altschwager of Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerA couple of quick ones for me. Just first, with respect to real estate, I was hoping you could touch on the outlook for the portfolio there. I think you had some net closures in the quarter, probably some seasonality. But just in the context of the ongoing strength you're seeing in digital channels, how should we be thinking about the runway there?And then separately, with respect to gross margin, Scott, it looks like you're going to be approaching fiscal '21's high watermark this year. Maybe touch on some of the gross margin puts and takes beyond fiscal '23. It seems like freight is still an opportunity. You might be seeing some geographic mix benefits. Just wonder if there's any headwinds to be mindful of as we update our models?Joanne C. CrevoiseratYes. I may kick it off with a question on our fleet. We were pleased actually to see the brick-and-mortar sales continue to grow. We drove low teens growth in brick-and-mortar. And I continue to say we have the best teams in the business and having customers and welcoming customers back to our stores gives us an opportunity to have our associates connect our customers more deeply with our brands.And it's a terrific experience if you've been in our stores, hopefully, you know that. But we also have digital capabilities to meet the customer where they are. And that's proved to be a really strong investment, and we continue to improve the experience we're delivering both in brick-and-mortar but as well as online. And as we evaluate our fleet, we continue to prune and make sure that we have high profitability and productivity thresholds for our stores. And that's a constant evolution.So you will see us make changes to our fleet, but we see opportunities to grow overall in stores. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, we see the opportunity to grow our store fleet. I think we said 100 stores growth over that time period, 50 to 100 stores of growth over that time period. And most of that store growth we see happening in Asia. So in the other markets, you'll see us open some and maybe close on relocate, remodel.But maybe I'll pass it to Scott, he can give you the actual numbers, but that's how we think about, strategically think about the fleets and managing it.Scott A. RoeYes, you had it, Joanne,around 100, 80, I think Christina is telling me 70. So -- but the important thing is we're managing our lease terms effectively. We can turn the entire fleet. We have about a 4-year average term. And underneath that, we're always finding certain areas that are trending down, and we're moving out of those and we're finding new areas that make sense given our insight into the consumer and where they're at and where they want to shop. So there's what I call the normal hygiene that's going on underneath that. But no huge changes in the fleet size is just the growth, which is mostly outside of the U.S.As it relates to gross margin, just a quick comment. We're obviously not going to give any guidance or specifics. But if you think about it, there is puts and takes that are always happening. We see leather prices moderating. We continue to see hardware and some of the other componentry having upward pressure, labor is a continued upward pressure. But to me, the most important thing is what Todd said earlier, it's the focus on engagement with the customer, the insights that we have and increases our bag in average to make good decisions. We're investing behind the brands. And ultimately, that means pricing power.So why do I have confidence in our gross margin, it's pricing power, the insights that we have. The shape of the business will help us a little bit as we go forward to the recovery of China and our Asia business is generally higher margin too. So from a mix standpoint, that will benefit us over time.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it over to Joanne for some concluding remarks.Joanne C. CrevoiseratThank you for joining us today and for your interest in our story. Today, we reported a strong third quarter and raised our outlook for the full year. This is a testament to our incredible global teams who continue to drive our results.Our performance also reinforces the power of our brands and our globally diversified direct-to-consumer business model. These competitive advantages are clearly differentiated results. We're confident in our strategy and our runway is significant. We remain focused on driving sustainable growth and shareholder returns into the future. Thanks again, and have a great day.OperatorThis concludes Tapestry's Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for your participation.]"

Tapestry is jumping after the company raised its profit outlook, despite a slowdown of luxury purchases in the US. The Coach handbagmaker saw demand rebound in China and saw overall net sales climb 5%. You talk about some of the rebound and companies in retail, and perhaps this could be or offer at least a little bit of a precursor to the rest of some of the retail earnings that are still set to come. How they're navigating a consumer in China that is ready or where they had cited pent up demand, and if that is actually carrying through right now as it is for Tapestry.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it does seem to be. So we've got Coach, we've got Kate Spade, and we've got Stuart Weitzman--BRAD SMITH: Suart Weitzman, yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --that are the three main. The China sales were up about 20% in constant currency. So that is really to what the company is attributing the beat this quarter. And it says revenue is gonna be about $6.7 billion for its annual forecast. It's the second time it's raised its forecast for the full year over the past three months, so just ratcheting up expectations. And as we look to the read through for retail, I think, obviously, the read through would be to the higher end of retail, to China exposed retail as well. So we're gonna be watching those types of companies very closely.BRAD SMITH: I mean, I almost even bought some Tiffany Air Force 1s during the first quarter.JULIE HYMAN: Really?BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Well, that's more of an LVMH play.BRAD SMITH: LVMH, yeah.JULIE HYMAN: And Nike for that matter.BRAD SMITH: But the high end, I would say.JULIE HYMAN: Right.BRAD SMITH: Right, is what I--JULIE HYMAN: Nothing but high end for Bradley.BRAD SMITH: Nah, I mean, look, man, I still shop anywhere.

We welcomed over 100 Latinx/e leaders from the private and public sector. This year's event was particularly notable as HOPE, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization committed to ensuring political and economic parity for Latinas through leadership, advocacy, and education to benefit all communities and the status of women, announced the release of Economic Status of Latinas report which was, in part, funded by the Tapestry Foundation.The report lays out how Latinas in New York State are faring, and the conditions that impact their ability to thrive economically as the COVID-19 pandemic emergency comes to a close while its effects linger and the nation hovers on the brink of a recession. The findings illustrate how deeply Latinas suffered and adapted during the early parts of the pandemic. Latina professionals offer a more intimate look into how they are overcoming barriers to their success and their hopes for their future as they deal with inflation in the post-pandemic recovery. Despite population shifts, uneven educational outcomes, ongoing wage and leadership inequities and persistent reports of burnout, Latinas reveal that their enduring optimism reported in previous HOPE and other research remains one of their greatest assets to overcoming adversity.The day was also marked by the governor's proclamation of May 4 as New York Latina History Day.Key research findings include:Latinas in the state of New York were 10% of the total population and nearly 20% of the population of women in 2021. One in every four women in New York City is a Latina.While New York experienced a slight population decline, the Hispanic population continues to increase.Story continuesPersistent pay gap with regional disparitiesLatinas in New York were paid only 58 cents for every dollar earned by a White, non-Hispanic man in 2021, compared to 82 cents for White women.Latinas in New York City earned only 45 cents for every dollar earned by a White man, down 2 cents from 2010.In Manhattan (New York County) Latinas earn only 36 cents- a wage gap of 64 cents with White men.Some progress for Latina high-income earners and employment ratesIn New York, the percentage of Latinas earning more than $100,000 doubled from 2% to 4% between 2019 and 2021. (The figure rose at the national level from 1% to 3%.)The unemployment rate for Latinas in New York dropped to 5.5% in 2022, an improvement from 14.4% in 2020.Entrepreneurship thrives among LatinasLatina-owned employer businesses in New York generated nearly 34,000 jobs with an annual payroll of $1.2 billion, demonstrating their notable rates of entrepreneurial participation.The number of Latina-owned employer businesses in New York grew 11% between 2018 and 2020.Educational attainment and barriersThe Latina public high school graduation rate in New York has steadily increased to 86% in 2022, narrowing the gap with the graduation rate for White women (94%) to its lowest level ever.The percentage of Hispanic students (24.7%) who took at least one AP course was almost half that of White students (43.5%).In New York 25.7% of all Latinas have a bachelor's or post-graduate degree, higher than the national rate of 21.6%.Download the full report and learn more about HOPE here: https://www.latinas.org/View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/754236/Tapestry-Hosts-Hispanas-Organized-for-Political-Equality-HOPE-for-Second-Annual-NYC-Latina-History-Day]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 High-Flying Majors to Buy for Long-Term GainsWall Street has remained range-bound since April barring 2-3 days of rally or decline. Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market stays resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. However, first-quarter 2023 earnings of corporate America are better-than-expected so far. In its May FOMC meeting, the Fed refrained from giving any clearcut signal regarding the end of the current rate hike regime.Investment StrategyInvestors remain directionless about the future trajectory of the U.S. stock movement. In such a situation, a good investment strategy can provide strong returns in the long term.First, select U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have an excellent business model, globally acclaimed brand value and a sound financial position. Second, select those corporate bigwigs that have flourished year to date with robust potential for the rest of 2023 and the long term (next 3 to 5 years).Our Top PicksBased on the above-mentioned methodology, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants. These stocks have long-term earnings growth potential higher than the expected earnings growth of 10.7% for the broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in the emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world's second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platform has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.6% and 19.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.6% over the last 30 days. Meta Platform has a long-term earnings growth potential of 19.5%. The stock price of META has jumped 93.7% year to date.NVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA.A collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to enhance NVDA's presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment's revenues to witness a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025.Zacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10% and 34.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. NVIDIA has a long-term earnings growth potential of 17.5%. The stock price of NVDA has soared 97.6% year to date.Amazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN's cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining momentum among customers.Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN's strong global presence and solid momentum across small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect 2023 revenues to be up 5% from 2022.Zacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last 30 days. Amazon has a long-term earnings growth potential of 18.4%. The stock price of AMZN has advanced 31.2% year to date.Booking Holdings Inc. is benefiting from a substantial improvement in its booking trends. Solid growth in domestic bookings is contributing well. Further, BKNG is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental car, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Also, solid momentum across the agency, merchant, and advertising and other businesses is a tailwind for BKNG. Our estimates suggest that agency, merchant, and advertising and other revenues would see a year-over-year rise of 2.3%, 18.7% and 8.2%, respectively, in 2023. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. We expect 2023 total revenues to be up 9.5% from 2022.Zacks Rank #1 Booking Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 36.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4% over the last seven days. Booking Holdings has a long-term earnings growth potential of 16.5%. The stock price of BKNG has surged 31.3% year to date.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has been benefiting from its strong comparable restaurant sales growth, digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and menu innovation. Moreover, strength in digital sales, rise in menu prices, new restaurant openings and higher restaurant-level operating margin have been driving CMG's performance.CMG reported solid benefits from Project Square One with improvements, including throughput on the frontline, on-time and accuracy on the digital make line. CMG also emphasizes smarter pickup times to boost growth.Zacks Rank #1 Chipotle Mexican Grill has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.3% and 32.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5% over the last 30 days. Chipotle Mexican Grill has a long-term earnings growth potential of 31.8%. The stock price of CMG has climbed 48.1% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

TRV has been favored by investors on the back of strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio, positive renewal premium change, high levels of retention and effective capital deployment.Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Travelers’ 2023 earnings is pegged at $14.31, indicating a 15.2% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 9.9% higher revenues of $40.77 billion. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $16.54, indicating a 15.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 8.1% higher revenues of $44.08 billion.Northbound Estimate RevisionEstimates for 2023 and 2024 have moved up nearly 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively, in the past 30 days, reflecting investors’ optimism.Earnings Surprise HistoryTravelers has a decent earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with the average being 16.43%.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceTravelers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 5.7%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 5.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness TailwindsRiding on strong net earned premiums and an aggregate underlying combined ratio for Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, strong underwriting results continued in the commercial businesses. High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers.Given an improving rate environment, the insurer raised the outlook for fixed income net investment income, including earnings from short-term securities to $530 million after tax in the second quarter, to an estimated $555 million in the third quarter and then to around $575 million in the fourth quarter. Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio are likely to drive the metric higher.Travelers maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. The debt-to-capital ratio was within the insurer’s target range of 15% to 25%. TRV aims to generate increased earnings and capital, maintain a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time as part of its long-term financial strategy. Balance sheet strength driven by scale, profitability and cash flow support it to invest more than $1 billion annually on technology.Sustained operational excellence helped generate double-digit core return on equity (ROE) in nine of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6%. Core ROE was 14.5% in the first quarter of 2023. The company aims to generate mid-teens core ROE over time.Travelers has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years. Its current dividend yield of 2% is better than the industry average of 0.3%. This makes TRV an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the property and casualty insurance industry are Kinsale Capital Group, Inc.

234,024551bc-b294-305b-b10c-c39666f8dab4,APD,2023-05-12,Air Products and Chemicals' (NYSE:APD) earnings growth rate lags the 14% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-nyse-apd-140024975.html,1683813624,STORY,['APD'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) shareholders have enjoyed a 69% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 44% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 24% in the last year , including dividends .In light of the stock dropping 4.4% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Air Products and Chemicals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 11% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Air Products and Chemicals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Air Products and Chemicals the TSR over the last 5 years was 90%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Air Products and Chemicals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals that you should be aware of before investing here.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

If you wish to see the top ones, feel free to head straight to the 5 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023. Television has merged seamlessly into contemporary culture, bringing information and pleasure to viewers all around the world. When a movie or television show shoots on location, it creates jobs, generates income, and spurs the creation of related infrastructure, giving the local economy a quick boost. Motion Picture Association says that the sector provides $21 billion in annual payments to more than 260,000 companies in cities and small towns across the nation, and the sector is made up of more than 122,000 companies, 92 percent of which have fewer than 10 employees. When a movie shoots on location, the local economy can receive a daily boost of up to $250,000. Popular films and television shows can occasionally help the tourism industry. For instance, 20th Century Fox's blockbuster television series This Is Us, streamed on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Prime Video, contributed more than $61.5 million to the Californian economy, while Marvel's Black Panther employed more than 3,100 local Georgians and paid them more than $26.5 million in compensation. The Post and The Greatest Showman, two Oscar-nominated films, helped New York's local economy by more than $108 million.Viewership isn't near the levels it used to be due to the proliferation of TV shows and other forms of entertainment. With the introduction of streaming services, the business has quickly changed to accommodate this circumstance and has been given new life. The streaming age was started by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), but other companies quickly realized their potential and entered the market, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Amazon Prime, HBO with HBO Max, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Disney+ by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Story continuesThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns led to a surge in the number of people turning to streaming platforms for their television entertainment. Rather than watching one episode per week, people started ""binge-watching"" entire seasons in one sitting. As a result, streaming companies have seen exponential growth over the past decade, with millions of new viewers added each year. The pandemic provided an additional boost to this trend in 2020.Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) had a record-breaking 37 million new customers in 2020, while The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney+ crossed the 100 million subscriber mark in just 16 months. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been able to generate total revenue of $23.51 billion as of 2022 while Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) generated $33.81 billion in the same year. Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), on the other hand, generated $514 billion in revenue in 2022, leaving behind both The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). However, in 2022 more than $300 billion in market value was lost as a result of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s announcement that its subscriber base had decreased, which destroyed its shares and other streaming companies' values. Each streaming service has experienced slower growth rates due to intense rivalry brought on by a large number of formidable rivals, and the future of the Tv show industry will rely on how streaming companies fare.  The Impact Of Covid On The Entertainment IndustryThe global market for theater, home entertainment, and mobile entertainment reached $80.8 billion in 2020, an 18% fall from the previous year and the lowest since 2016. The box office plummeted from $42.3 billion in 2019 to $12 billion in 2020, which was the most significant decline. Compared to 2019, when it made up 43% of all entertainment spending worldwide, live theater only made up just 15% of that total. The 15 most-watched TV shows of 2023 are a testament to the industry's ability to adapt and overcome challenges, providing audiences with engaging and exciting content that they can't get enough of. As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, the TV show industry is poised to continue its growth, creating new and exciting shows that audiences will love. 15 Most Watched TV Shows of 2023mollie-sivaram-yubCnXAA3H8-unsplashOur Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the 15 most-watched TV shows of 2023 based on their total number of hours viewed, in ascending order.

Given the segment operating income beat and narrowing of DTC losses, we would not be surprised if shares traded modestly higher tomorrow.Goldman Sachs cut the price target to $130 per share, from the prior $136, but remains Buy-rated on DIS stock:Our key positive takeaway from DIS’s F2Q23 results is that we believe management is showing solid execution against key profitability initiatives outlined last quarter... Our key negative takeaway is that DIS continues to confront both secular and cyclical headwinds, which may yield lumpy operating trends including during 2H.Airbnb warns of slowing growthAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) said it made $0.18 a share - a swing from last year's loss but also $0.02 shy of Street expectations - on in-line revenue of $1.8 billion.

And sales of $7.04 billion edged past the consensus.Looking ahead, the company now expects to grow adjusted EPS by about 20% to $4.95; up from prior guidance of 18% growth to $4.87.But Oppenheimer believes PayPal stock ""may be stuck"" in the near term:We get the strategic value of Braintree, but investors will ask; how long can you cut expenses to offset profitability declines which impact valuation? Meaningful PPCP profitability help is likely quarters/years away. Thus, revenue growth likely slower than TPV. We/ investors need to see sustainable underlying margin expansion given their scale.Deutsche Bank said the move lower in PYPL shares is a result of the investor focus on transaction margin pressures:Transaction margins are under pressure and will only begin to improve yoy if branded volumes rebounds (as share loss worries continue). As a result, we expect higher revenues to be fully offset by lower transaction margins.Shares were recently down some 12% for the week.Yasin Ebrahim, Davit Kirakosyan, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Amid a firehose of news in these whipsaw markets, seize on the right news lightning quick to ensure you protect your profits: Always be the first to know with InvestingPro.Start your free 7-day trial now.Related Articles3 big earnings hits: Disney falls down; Airbnb warns; PayPal 'may be stuck'Tesla to recall over 1.1 million foreign and China-made cars - Chinese regulatorToshiba says working with JIP to 'quickly complete' $15 billion buyout]"

However, these disturbances have also tilled the soil for much-needed innovation, and investors can play a major role in transforming the industry for the future, according to new research from PGIM, the $1.2 trillion global investment management business of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230511005220/en/""There is no question the food system is in the early stages of a generational transformation. It will need to grow more productive as well as more sustainable to meet the myriad challenges it faces."" --Shehriyar Antia, Head of Thematic Research, PGIM (Photo: Business Wire)To understand the emerging investment opportunities and hidden risks from this ongoing transformation, PGIM’s latest Megatrends research, ""Food for Thought: Investment Opportunities Across a Changing Food System,"" gathers insights from investment professionals across PGIM’s fixed income, equity, real estate, private credit and alternatives managers — as well as leading policymakers, academics, entrepreneurs, economists, and private equity and venture capital investors. The research urges investors to look beyond today’s headlines toward the long-term trends that are just beginning to reshape our global food system.As populations around the world grow in affluence, preferences are shifting toward resource-intensive foods — such as meat and processed foods. PGIM’s analysis shows this trend — along with diets converging globally — is transforming the food system and reshaping how and what we eat today and for the next decade. With the negative impact of climate change on food production also accelerating, technology and innovation will be crucial in finding new ways of growing and producing food to meet these challenges.Story continues""From farm to fork, our global food system is vast, complex, inefficient and increasingly unfit for purpose,"" says Shehriyar Antia, PGIM’s head of thematic research. ""There is no question the food system is in the early stages of a generational transformation. It will need to grow more productive as well as more sustainable to meet the myriad challenges it faces. Investors chasing the next food trend will be better served focusing on the innovation that is happening all across the food value chain — from crop science and farm equipment to advances in packaging, logistics, even alternative agriculture.""Shifting demographics and preferences provide appetizing opportunitiesThese changing dynamics will drive growth in key areas across the food system:Cold storage turning hot: As consumers demand more fresh foods as well as online grocery and food delivery, companies that provide both cold-storage warehouses and long-haul transport may be especially attractive.Packaging offers cash flows no matter the food fad: Established food packaging players are a way of taking advantage of the growing market for prepared foods, without depending on volatile consumer behavior. Large players can fund innovations, are more resilient to recessions, and have a sticky customer base.Meat producers offer a global contrarian investment opportunity: While plant-based and lab-grown meats dominate headlines, alternative meat demand is declining. Meanwhile, global demand for animal-based proteins is set to grow 14% by 2030.Convenience and food safety drives emerging market opportunities: Companies in Latin America and Asia will continue to see growth from the shift to convenience and ""Western"" diets. Investors should seek local companies offering exposure to food and beverage staples with strong brand loyalty and extensive logistic expertise.Innovation and technology improve productivity and sustainabilityFood security, the sustainability of the global food system, as well as food price inflation, all raise important considerations for investors. Key trends include:AgTech is driving smarter, more sustainable food production on small farms: Smart devices, sensors and mobile apps can improve the efficiency, profitability and sustainability of small farms. Meanwhile, precision agriculture — which draws on AI and proprietary data analytics — is doing the same for large-scale industrial farms.Crop science and feed additives boost productivity and sustainability: Global leaders in crop science offer real-world, scalable solutions to boost sustainability and improve productivity. Enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are critical for a stronger and more sustainable food system.Farmland debt and equity offer unique exposure and attractive investment: Institutional ownership of farmland is growing but is still at a nascent stage, with only about 3% of U.S. farmland owned by institutional capital. Direct farming operations and leases can supply a steady source of income for investors, while productivity gains can drive capital appreciation.Cultivated meat, more sizzle than steak: Though cultivated meat has attracted more than $1 billion in venture capital, the market is highly fragmented and not economically viable, with little visibility about which ones may emerge as winners. This segment is likely to see significant consolidation in coming years.""The transformation of the food system right now is very similar to the energy sector 10 years ago and is in the midst of disruption,"" says Jakob Wilhelmus, director of thematic research for PGIM. ""Investors can take advantage of this by identifying those companies that are truly enhancing productivity and sustainability along the food value chain, versus those that are not adapting and will be more vulnerable to the complex challenges ahead.""To learn more about these trends and the companies that are benefiting the most, read ""Food for Thought: Investment Opportunities Across a Changing Food System,"" the latest in PGIM’s Megatrends research series.ABOUT PGIMPGIM is the global asset management business of Prudential Financial, Inc.

(PRU) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-prudential-financial-130001390.html,1683810001,STORY,['PRU'],"[Prudential (PRU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this financial services company have returned -5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Prudential belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Prudential is expected to post earnings of $3.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +75.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.03 points to a change of +27.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.87 indicates a change of +7% from what Prudential is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Prudential.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PRU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Prudential, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.47 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.54 billion and $53.76 billion estimates indicate -13.2% and +0.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPrudential reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.6%. EPS of $2.66 for the same period compares with $3.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.65%. The EPS surprise was -11.92%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Prudential is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Prudential. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.55bUS$3.34bUS$3.27bUS$3.24bUS$2.75bUS$2.66bUS$2.62bUS$2.60bUS$2.61bUS$2.63bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -3.34%Est @ -1.70%Est @ -0.56%Est @ 0.24%Est @ 0.80% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.6% US$3.2kUS$2.8kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.1kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.6%– 2.1%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 9.6%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$33b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$47.3, the company appears about fair value at a 8.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Devon Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.257. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Devon EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now.Value stocks were clear winners in 2022. As inflation spiked and the Federal Reserve started to boost interest rates, investors fled risky stocks with huge valuations and favored cheap value stocks with realistic multiples. Come 2023, the economic realities that caused a panic in the market remain intact. That’s why major analysts are still recommending piling into value playsAccording to Wall Street Journal, investment firm GMO expects growth stocks to fall further while the firm believes value stocks remain discounted.The report added that about 21% of GMO’s $4.3 billion portfolio was invested in hedge funds seeking to profit from the fall in growth stocks.Tech stocks jumped to new highs recently on the back of optimism that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree is nearing its end. Some analysts believe the market is incorporating the possibility of rate cuts. Prudent investors and analysts are rejecting this optimism and warning that the latest rally in stocks might not last.In February, Goldman Sachs analyst’s analyst Lisa Shalett issued a similar warning:""We remain cautious about the direction of the equities market this year, as these other assets do not confirm the optimistic outlook implied by stocks’ performance. Equity investors are sending prices and valuation multiples higher, with little consideration for broader implications. The likely impacts of tightening monetary policy, corporate earnings vulnerability and uncertainty around the path of inflation are additional reasons for prudence.""In January 2023, Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer gave a bullish outlook for value stocks and said that tech valuations were inflated despite massive declines in share prices, According to the analyst,“As big cap technology sees further margin pressure, commodity prices rise and real interest rates remain higher, we think this trend has further to go.”Story continues""Priced for Perfection""Similarly, Bob Doll, Crossmark Global Investments CIO, recently said in a program on CNBC that the market is priced for “perfection.” The analyst said that economic indicators “haunt” him as he believes the possibility of a soft landing is thin. Doll said last year’s market decline was mostly due to “valuation compression” while this year’s declines will be because of “earnings problems” and “recession.” Answering a question about the possible options for investors in this environment, Doll recommended diversification and said he’s underweight tech. He thinks many tech stocks have been “lagging and struggling.” Doll recommended investors to own value stocks that are not just cheap but has some “current momentum.”Value has “returned with a vengeance,” to quote a JPMorgan’s report, which said that while growth stocks have outperformed value stocks for a long time in the past, the future outlook for value plays look strong. Here’s what the report said:“Value’s potential for future returns remains great. Valuation spreads between Value and Growth are still extreme, and higher than those at the peak of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) bubble. The proportion of equity assets invested with a Value investment style is also very low, meaning flows could provide a significant tailwind.”In this backdrop, it’s a good idea to take a look at stocks that have attractive value multiples, strong profits and  fundamentals.Most Profitable Value Stocks NowOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used a stock screener to find stocks with PE ratios of less than 15 as of April 27 and positive revenue growth. From this list, we picked stocks that have the highest net income (TTM) and the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:OGE) ranks 16th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now. In February OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) posted full-year 2022 results. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $3.32, easily beating estimates. Revenue in the period totaled $3.37 billion, beating estimates by $2.31 billion. OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) is a high-yield dividend stock, with an over 4% yield.17 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds were long OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:OGE) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.15.

Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) in March declared a quarterly dividend of CAD 1.32 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. The forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.81%.14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21French energy giant TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) is one of the most profitable value plays. During the first quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)’s adjusted EPS came in at $2.61, in line with estimates. Over the past 12 months, the company’s net income stands at over $20.5 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE).ClearBridge International Value Strategy made the following comment about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection in the energy sector was also a strong driver of returns, benefiting from an improving global macro outlook. Prospects for a milder recession, increased demand from China reopening from its COVID-19 restrictions, and the recognition that the market hasn’t discounted oil company valuations based on commodity prices all served to benefit energy company stock prices. Holdings such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), a leading French oil, and natural gas company, was a recipient of these macro tailwinds. We are constructive on the long-term prospects of the energy sector, with it being the second largest relative overweight in the portfolio. We believe that as the market becomes more comfortable with the industry’s intermediate earnings and capital discipline from producers, our high-quality companies in the sector should continue to perform.”13.

Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $266 million stake in the company.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.”11. WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:WCC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Raymond James recently gave a Strong Buy rating for WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:WCC). The firm said WESCO International, Inc.

Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) posted its Q4 results back in February. Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK)’s adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.59, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter jumped 20.1% year over year to reach $2.39 billion, beating estimates by $70 million. Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over three years toward coated recycled paperboard production.As of the end of the fourth quarter, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) was Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management which owns a $179 million stake in the company.9. The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Chemicals and fertilizer company The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) ranks 9th in our list of the most profitable value stocks now. In February The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.74, missing estimates by $0.46. Revenue in the quarter jumped about 16.7% year over year to $4.48 billion, beating estimates by $260 million.In February The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was payable on March 30.White Brook Capital made the following comment about The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS): Despite favorable midterm fertilizer dynamics, Mosaic (MOS) performed worse than expected during the quarter. Significantly, the Company began to rally in the last days of the quarter after it preannounced production at the low end of the guidance for the first quarter when market fears were for an even worse outcome.  Given March weather, particularly in the northern United States, where a significant snow pack continued to cover farmland (as of the first days of April), I expect their 1stquarter earnings call will speak to significant second-quarter demand, particularly as the weather was more favorable for fertilizer usage in early April. Prices during the second week of April for fertilizers broadly also have begun to lessen their decline despite a continued rapid decline in other feedstock commodities.The stock has been driven by concern about destroyed 2023 demand that I believe, given the state of the world’s depleted fields, issues that demand can no longer be destroyed, only delayed, and even that may not be necessary given the rapid improvement of the US’s northern grain basket and the solid fundamentals in Brazil.  The Company continues to trade for a very cheap valuation even though it generates strong free cash flow, returns that cash flow to shareholders, and is under levered. We continue to hold our position.”8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Defense giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the most notable value stocks right now. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) keeps winning major contracts from the US government for several defense and aerospace activities. It was recently awarded a $158.13 million definitized contract action for Global Hawk (RQ-4) aircraft sustainment.Morgan Stanley added Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its 30 for 2025 stock picks list.LRT Capital made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its October investor letter:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7. United Rentals, Inc.

(NYSE:URI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) rents equipment primarily to construction and industrial companies, as well to as manufacturers, utilities, homeowners, municipalities, and other government entities. The company has benefitted from the continued tightness throughout the machinery sector, as original equipment manufacturers struggle to meet demand due to ongoing supply chain constraints. Activity within most of its major customer verticals remains strong, and the company sees itself as well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends such as the reshoring of global supply chains and increased infrastructure investment.”6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Oil giant Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) received bullish comments from Scotiabank's Paul Cheng recently.

Let’s be real: Biden doesn’t have the greatest approval rating. And he’s old – astonishingly old. Nevertheless, he does have a solid chance of winning the White House again. And that bodes well for the blue-collar sector because of Biden and construction industry dynamics.Obviously, Biden initially ran on the campaign promise to build back better. And he helped make good on that promise via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. With a second term, Biden may bring some predictability to the political order. Further, reports about the construction industry analysis in 2023 point toward the pursuit of growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. There’s a better chance of that happening if Biden wins.Still, how can anyone be so confident about his reelection? As The Guardian pointed out, the Republicans are internally divided. You have small-government Republicans (remember those guys?), Trump hardliners and the “Fringe” (it’s better I don’t explain). For the Democrats, you only have President Biden and “Dark Brandon.” It’s just a more cogent framework. Here are the top construction companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMLMMartin Marietta Materials$397.66MASMasco$53.45VMCVulcan Materials$193.57CATCaterpillar$215.09DEDeere$381.09URIUnited Rentals$342.05KELYAKelly Services$16.24Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) is a supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, with operations spanning 26 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. Notably, Martin Marietta supplies resources for the construction of roads, sidewalks, and foundations. Presently, it features a market capitalization of $24.65 billion. Since the start of the year, MLM gained an impressive 15%, making it one of the best construction stocks to buy now.Story continuesOn the financials, Martin Marietta benefits from solid operational statistics. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.3%, above 68.87% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 12.4%, above 64.09% of sector rivals. On the bottom line, the company posts a trailing-year net margin of 14.07%, outflanking 82.64% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg MLM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $418.50, implying almost 8% upside potential.Masco (MAS)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAn American manufacturer of products for the home improvement and new home construction markets, Masco (NYSE:MAS) is a bit of a risk when compared to other top construction companies to invest in. Largely, MAS depends on sentiment for renovation and real estate acquisition. That’s questionable given rising layoffs and interest rates. Nevertheless, for contrarians, MAS could rank among the best construction stocks to buy now.Indeed, the market carries optimism, with shares bouncing over 11% since the Jan. opener. Operationally, Masco enjoys encouraging stats. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 17.1%, ranked above 84.26% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period lands at 13.4%, above 67.44%. On the bottom line, Masco prints an excellent trailing-year net margin of 9.67%, beating out 82.91% of the competition. As with Martin Marietta, Masco benefits from consistent profitability.Lastly, covering analysts peg MAS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $57.92, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Vulcan Materials (VMC)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHailing from Birmingham, Alabama, Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates— primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel — and a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, according to its website. Because of the Biden and construction industry relationship, VMC popped up 8% since the beginning of this year.Investors may look forward to additional gains as VMC ranks among the best construction stocks to buy now. Primarily, Vulcan enjoys strong sales performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above 80.44% of its rivals. On the bottom line, Vulcan features an operating margin and net margin of 13.79% and 7.87%, respectively. Both stats rank above at least 65% of sector peers.To close out, analysts peg VMC as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 10 buys, two holds and zero sells. Overall, the experts’ average price target is $209, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Caterpillar (CAT)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA world-famous construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is no stranger to lists targeting the best construction stocks to buy now. However, it’s interesting at this juncture because of the Biden and construction industry dynamics. In the runup to the 2016 presidential election, former President Donald Trump often praised Caterpillar. However, CAT represents a contrarian play, with shares down 12% since the January opener.To be fair, many of its fiscal stats sit as rather ho-hum: not bad, not great. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 5.7%, better than 54% of its peers. That’s nice but nothing earth-shattering. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the aforementioned period is 9.2%, better than 50.43% of sector players. Again, nothing remarkable.However, Caterpillar offers business predictability. Its operating margin and net margin ping at 15.73% and 11.53%, ranking better than at least 87% of other construction stocks. Currently, analysts peg CAT as a hold. On average, the experts anticipate shares hitting $239.07, implying growth potential of almost 14%.Deere (DE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Specializing in the manufacture of agricultural machinery, Deere (NYSE:DE) is a key player in heavy equipment, forestry machinery, diesel engines, drivetrains used in heavy equipment, and lawn care equipment. Given the Democrats’ holistic view of infrastructure, the need to boost food-related supply chains should undergird this special category of the best construction stocks to buy now. Since the start of the year, DE lost 12% of its equity value.However, such red ink seems rather unreasonable given the broader fiscal picture. Operationally, Deere’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 11.7%, beating out nearly 72% of its peers. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 18.6%, above 72.46%. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin lands at 14.9%, ranked better than 92% of sector players. Also, it enjoys consistent profitability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $470.15, implying nearly 26% upside potential.United Rentals (URI)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBilled as the world’s largest equipment rental company, United Rentals (NYSE:URI) owns approximately 4,700 classes of equipment. In addition, United offers a combined total of over 1,400 locations covering North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Should President Biden win reelection, construction demand might soar, boding well for equipment providers.Enticingly, the market prices URI at a forward multiple of 7.93. As a discount to projected earnings, United ranks better than 82.78% of the competition. Also, URI trades at 4.86 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 10.91 times. Operationally, United posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.9%, ranked better than 71.89% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the aforementioned period is 25.5%, outpacing nearly 85% of the field.Looking to the Street, analysts peg URI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $421.83, implying over 28% upside potential. Though it’s a higher risk, it makes a solid case for the best construction stocks to buy now.Kelly Services (KELYA)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAn office staffing company featuring global operations, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might not immediately figure as one of the top construction companies to invest in. However, Kelly provides staffing solutions for myriad industries, including the construction sector. And frankly, building back better doesn’t mean much if companies don’t have anyone to do so.To be fair, KELYA represents one of the higher-risk stories among construction stocks, with shares down 7% year-to-date. Still, it could attract speculators because of its value proposition. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 9.99. As a discount to projected earnings, Kelly ranks better than 72.19% of the competition. Also, KELYA trades at 0.63 times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median is a lofty 2.14 times.On the balance sheet, Kelly enjoys a cash-to-debt ratio of 2.18, above 61.56% of its peers.

The UK’s digital regulator said last month that cloud services firms might be abusing their market power to thwart fair competition and suggested that the competition authority open a market investigation.The US cloud market is dominated by Amazon, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft. Licensing practices make it hard for companies to effectively switch among providers, said Frederic Jenny, an economics professor at ESSEC Business School in Paris.Jenny has been researching potential anticompetitive conduct in cloud markets on behalf of Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe, a trade association of European cloud providers that includes Amazon, Reevo Spa and Gigas Hosting SA, among others.“There is a great deal of confusion about fairness and competition in the cloud,” Jenny said. “Because there are many different business models, people are quite confused about what is the norm.”Story continuesJenny said at the FTC workshop that Microsoft charges additional licensing fees to use its Windows and Office software with rival cloud providers, like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Oracle also charges additional fees for use of its popular database software on other clouds, he added.Amazon Web Services imposes charges to move data out of its data centers, making migrations difficult and expensive, said Steven Weber, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Information.Preston Grisham, a spokesman for Amazon Web Services, said in an interview after the event that the company doesn’t charge different prices for data transfers to other cloud providers than it does for transfers for other purposes. That practice is standard in the industry, he said. Amazon reduced its fees in November 2021, he noted.Microsoft made changes to its cloud licensing terms in Europe last year in response to concerns, according to spokesman David Cuddy, who was reached after the event.Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment.The dominance of just a few cloud providers could affect innovation in artificial intelligence, said Weber, who heads Berkeley’s Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity. Some of the big cloud companies have been offering artificial intelligence startups investments in the form of cloud credits, he added.“That kind of subsidy has the effect of tying a particular company’s AI models to a particular cloud provider,” he said.The FTC is accepting public comments on the cloud computing inquiry through June 21.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEric Adams Is Starving New York City’s Universal Pre-K ProgramThe Green Energy Transition Has a Chilean Copper ProblemAI Lets Microsoft Target Google and Google Target AmazonChina’s $220 Billion Biotech Initiative Is Struggling to Take OffThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-Cola©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The Ontario eHub can help these healthcare organizations share patient data more easily and securely, reducing administrative overhead, and facilitating improved care coordination for patients. Oracle Health is teaming with TransForm Shared Service Organization to manage the project.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)The initial roll-out integrates 16 long-term care facilities with five hospitals to support patients moving from acute to long-term care. The Ontario eHub will help caregivers at these facilities ease this transition by providing a clear view into each patient's health history, care plans, medications, and more from any connected device or existing EHR system, anywhere in the facility.""The Ontario eHub HIE reflects Oracle's longtime leadership in data interoperability,"" said Brian Sandager, vice president and general manager, Canada, Oracle Health. ""Initiatives like eHub in Ontario highlight our commitment to building a more connected and open healthcare ecosystem that will help deliver better outcomes for both patients and the medical professionals that work tirelessly to serve them.""Connecting data for better careOracle Health's HIE powers the Ontario eHub with sophisticated patient matching and data aggregation capabilities that enable clinicians to organize, review, and search for information more quickly and easily. To facilitate collaboration across the province, users at every site can have a consistent experience when accessing data in the system, which can be done via the HIE portal or through a viewer embedded directly into the facility's existing EHR.Story continues""Ontario is rapidly advancing towards more integrated systems, with the province adopting policies and establishing standards. Within the framework, HIE partners are implementing the first steps of a provincial data exchange that delivers a multitude of benefits including improved and safer transitions of care for patients and residents and better coordination of healthcare services for health service providers,"" said Lyn Baluyot, president and CEO, TransForm Shared Service Organization. ""I am proud of the hard work and dedication of the Ontario eHub HIE team for bringing us another giant step forward in providing coordinated care of Ontarians.""By the end of 2024, it is expected that all Ontario healthcare facilities utilizing Oracle Health's EHR will be integrated into the eHub as well as their long-term care facility partners. Ultimately, the Ontario eHub is an important cog to facilitate the future exchange of critical clinical data between other healthcare facilities, providers, and other Ontario health assets.About OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home According to Morgan McKinley’s 2023 Salary Guide, 69% of global employers offered higher-than-expected salaries to attract new employees in the past 12 months.But chucking money at the problem is no use, new research shows.Oracle surveyed 3,000 employees and HR leaders across the U.S., U.K., and Australia, and found that despite current economic uncertainty and the soaring cost of living, 55% of workers care more about having the right job than the right salary.What’s more, 88% would still walk away from a job that doesn’t meet their expectations, even during a recession.So leaders that thought they could buy their employee's loyalty will be disappointed.Instead, employers need to prioritize their employee experience—“or risk losing profits and market share”, Oracle’s researchers caution.Like inflation, employee expectations are on the upAs inflation rises and so too does the fear of a global recession, leaders may have hoped that workers’ expectations would lower. Yet Oracle’s research shows exactly the opposite is happening.Employee expectations for pay, flexibility, and training are increasing, in line with their fears about the future.According to the research, around half of workers are worried about job stability, burnout and having to reduce their standard of living. At the same time, 85% are concerned about the impact of the current economy on their careers and think it was easier to be successful before the pandemic.Despite these fears, employees reported that they want pay raises to meet inflation, flexible work options and more learning and development opportunities from their employer. To top it off, workers also want their voices heard and to have clearly defined goals to feel valued.Story continuesThe risk of not getting the employee experience rightUltimately even with above-average salaries and all the money that organizations have thrown at one-off bonuses and perks during the pandemic, the research shows that employees are still feeling like (well-paid) cogs in the machine.In the long term, this can lower productivity, increase turnover and even damage the brand.Still, the research reveals that nearly all of the leaders surveyed already know this, and so their lack of action demonstrates that employers are either not listening to their staff’s concerns, or worse, don’t care.But, as Oracle Cloud’s SVP Yvette Cameron warns: “If something doesn’t change soon, it could have a serious impact on the businesses’ bottom line.”This suggests it may be time for employers to listen and address employees' concerns, from flexible working to career growth, instead of chucking money at the problem—or risk another year of watching the revolving door of workers walking out.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The company also reiterating its full-year guidance, yet shares trading slightly lower, off just about a tenth of a percent. We want to break it all down with Krispy Kreme CEO Mike Tattersfield. We also have Brooke DiPalma joining the conversation.Mike, it's great to see you here. So strong quarter here from Krispy Kreme. You beat what the Street was looking for. What's driving the momentum that you're seeing in your business?MIKE TATTERSFIELD: Yeah. I mean, I appreciate having back on, so good afternoon. How-- I hope you're all doing well. I think the main driver is what's been consistent since we transformed the company. It's really those 400 producing doughnut shops as we really expand getting fresh doughnut distribution into what we call points of access-- so the grocery trade, the convenience shop trade, starting in the club trade as well. And we do that in 31 countries. We just opened up a 32nd in Chile. So it's just-- you combine that, and then you can bring the premiumization of the doughnuts. And you bring that category where our biggest opportunity is, which is access. Get it to where customers are.BROOKE DIPALMA: And you did raise prices here in the US, as well as in the UK. Are you seeing any resistance there, or are customers trading down?MIKE TATTERSFIELD: So we're a low-frequency business. People come and shop at us about three times a year. It's primarily a dozens business. A lot of our customers use us for gifting, and all the dozens, about 80% are shared. So on average, it's still about a little over a dollar a doughnut per dozen, right? So that opportunity is there. When we premiumize and bring in, whether a Biscoff cookie that we brought in in January, you have a Hershey's partnership which we did across the globe. We really see a low elasticity on price. We can-- we have pricing power, but we're really thoughtful about it. We want to always remain, you know, a sweet, indulgent treat that's affordable.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Mike, are you seeing those pricing pressures, though, ease at all on the back end of things, the pricing that you guys have going into your goods?MIKE TATTERSFIELD: So in terms of, you know, the commodities or inflation, it's still mid double digits. We're hedged this year. We're starting to see some of that starting to slow down on the back end of the year. Sugar's still up pretty high, probably at some of its historical highs lately. So there's a challenge there, but wheat and, you know, our other ingredients also are palm oil. So those are starting to come down slightly. So on average, those three make up 10% of our retail sales, so we can manage it.But again, we continue to look at how we get access to the customer. That's the thing that they don't get. Krispy Kreme is just-- it's tough for them to get it. So when you start to get to 12,000 locations over that in 32 countries and you do it fresh every day, for a lot of them, that's the first time they get access to Krispy Kreme.BROOKE DIPALMA: And one way is you're looking to bring Krispy Kreme doughnuts to customers is with your partnership, rather a test with McDonald's. What goals are you looking to meet in order to say, hey, this test is successful, and we're going to roll it out nationally and globally?MIKE TATTERSFIELD: Yeah. So, I mean, when-- when we started this, going fresh, right, we were looking at, what are the right channels we should be looking at? Clearly, the grocer and the convenience opportunity was there. And that's where we really started to push the business towards. We've been looking at club, the drug store business as well, and, most recently, into QSR. And what it has to do is actually work with what our Delivered Fresh Daily program does as a channel, right? So it's got to work with the other channels, so you can actually make the doughnuts fresh and then have a route system. You can drop them off.And so when we tested with McDonald's in the latter part of last year, in a nine-store test, we could see that those-- the rigor and the drop and the quality matched. And then we moved on to the markets of Louisville and Lexington, which we've been in for six weeks. I was just also recently in the market. And it's really about seeing, you know, as a merchant, are you getting the right pack size, is the freshness there, are we delivering on time, what are the KPIs, and going through a pretty rigorous process because channels and customers are going to have different-- you know, those customers are going to have different need states.Someone that's coming through in a drive-through that's looking for a coffee is probably going to do an individual serve. We really focus on dozens. So it's, how do we make sure that that works? And really getting the rigor of that tested gives us a lot of confidence that we can do it in the QSR industry. We are just doing this right now with McDonald's and learn-- both of us are learning. So we'll see where it goes. But we're pretty pleased with where we are right now.BROOKE DIPALMA: And Mike, this morning, you called it a doughnut logistics company. A lot of people thought that was pretty interesting. But I mean, your doughnuts are now in Walmart. You're in Publix. You're testing at Target and Albertsons, all fresh delivery daily. And so essentially, when you look at that model, how do you make sure that you're ultimately making a profit at the end of the day?MIKE TATTERSFIELD: So again, we look from this hub-and-spoke system, right? So our producing doughnut shops, right, they can go through the-- you know, they'll produce it at the shop. It can then be shipped through. You know, one channel could be the grocer channel. Then the route could also drop off a convenience. So we look at the profitability of the route. The doughnut maker that morning does not know where the doughnut's going. It could also be going through delivery and e-common-- e-commerce.So when you look across it, that's how you can see the profitability of the business. If you look at where the margins have improved, particularly in the US in the last quarter, a lot of that is because, again, the efficiency as you get the omnichannel approach. So that's how the business works. We've also seen in markets-- you know, the US started primarily as a doughnut shop business. So when we started to transform some of those shops to include the route system, their profitability improved dramatically, right? Because then you start to get the efficiency of what that producing shop can do.SEANA SMITH: Mike Tattersfield, thanks so much for joining us here at Yahoo Finance, CEO of Krispy Kreme. We hope you come back--MIKE TATTERSFIELD: Always a pleasure.SEANA SMITH: --and join us soon.MIKE TATTERSFIELD: Thank you to all the Krispy Kremers out there. Tell Brian I said hello, all right?

Yet even as the Federal Reserve suggests that interest rate cuts will not happen this year, and economic growth continues to slow, now may actually be a perfect time to search for REITs with high returns.Well, high potential returns, to be exact. While nothing is for certain, in hindsight diving into REITs could prove to be a profitable move. Since the Fed began to hike rates in 2022 to curb inflation, REITs, high-quality and low-quality alike, have been hammered to lower prices.However, these elevated interest rates are not permanent. As inflation continues to cool, the Fed will reverse course on its current monetary policy. Lower rates will help this sector make a recovery. That’s not all. Beyond just a rebound out of the current slumps, when it comes to REITs and long-term investing, there are plenty of names with strong yield and appreciation potential. A good example is with these seven. Each of these top REITs to buy has the potential to become REITs with high returns over a long time frame.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAIRCApartment Income REIT$36.03BXPBoston Properties$51.93IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$69.36NNNNNN. REIT$44.44OFCCorporate Office Properties$24.46PLDPrologis$127.25WPCW.P. Carey$73.24Apartment Income REIT (AIRC)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockApartment Income REIT (NYSE:AIRC) focuses on buying and managing multifamily properties. This REIT owns 75 apartment communities, across the United States. So, what makes AIRC stock one of the best REITs to buy now? For starters, Apartment Income REIT trades at a discount to peers. AIRC’s price-to-funds from operations (or P/FFO) ratio, the REIT equivalent of an earnings multiple, is 15.4. By comparison, names like AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) and Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) trade for P/FFO ratios in the 17-18 range.Story continuesAIRC also has a forward yield of 5.05%, versus 3.71% for AVB and 4.25%. However, it’s not as if relative value is the only factor that makes this apartment REIT a buy. As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, AIRC’s strategy of selling lower-return properties to buy higher-return properties leaves it poised to deliver income and capital growth to investors.Boston Properties (BXP)two women working on laptops in office space with black PPE face masks onSource: Halfpoint/shutterstock.comAre you a contrarian about the future of office buildings? Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) may be the right REIT for your portfolio. In the past, BXP has been considered one of the blue chip REITs, thanks to its portfolio of Class A office properties in top-tier U.S. metro areas. However, as remote and hybrid working trends have persisted, office REITs have cratered, and remain at depressed prices. This of course makes names like BXP stock risky, yet at the same, this uncertainty could mean big opportunity.Trading at a P/FFO of just 6.8, and with a forward yield of 7.8%, BXP has a lot to gain, if interest rates move lower, and if the labor market normalizes (giving employers more bargaining power for “return to office” mandates). Such a turn of events could make Boston Properties one of the REITS with high returns.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Cannabis leaf on dollar bill. Cannabis StocksSource: ShutterstockSpeaking of risky REITs, Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) is another such example. Don’t let the name fool you. Rather than owning a portfolio of industrial parks, IIPR owns and leases out properties to state-licensed cannabis growers. As I have argued previously, IIPR stock is one of the best cannabis stocks out there. This is due to its hefty dividend yield (10.6%), low valuation (P/FFO of 9.3), and exposure to the legalized cannabis trend. Admittedly though, there is a reason for its deep value status.IIPR’s rent collection rate has been declining, suggesting that its high yield is under threat. However, as I have argued before, IIPR is making efforts to mitigate this issue, including further diversification of its tenant base. If you’re risk-tolerant, and have conducted the proper REIT analysis of this name, IIPR is definitely a real estate investment trust to consider.NNN REIT (NNN)Commercial shopping center in a tropical climateSource: mTaira / Shutterstock.comFormerly known as National Retail Properties, NNN REIT (NYSE:NNN), is, as its name suggests, a REIT focused on properties leased out on a triple-net basis. In other words, NNN collects a base rent from tenants, who are responsible for occupancy costs such as insurance, maintenance, and real estate taxes.NNN stock is similar to its better-known peer Realty Income (NYSE:O) when it comes to dividends. Both names sport forward yield of just under 5%. NNN and O both have decades-long history of slow-and-steady dividend growth. However, this triple-net lease REIT has the edge, when it comes to valuation. NNN trades at a P/FFO ratio of 14, whereas O trades at a P/FFO ratio of 15.4. This may sound like a case of splitting hairs, but if you’re looking to add triple-net exposure to your portfolio, NNN may just well be the better choice.Corporate Office Properties (OFC)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockCompared to most office REITs, Corporate Office Properties (NYSE:OFC) appears to be much better-positioned to ride out the current slump in office space demand. Why? As I argued last month, it has to do with this REIT’s tenant base.That is, Corporate Office Properties Trust focused on owning/leasing out properties used by the U.S. Federal Government, as well as defense contractors. These types of properties may be more immune to work-from-home trends. Security requirements make it impossible for sensitive types of governmental work to be conducted fully remote.There’s also been a growing push to bring federal workers back into the office. The market isn’t fully aware of these strengths, yet one they catch on, it could turn OFC stock, which is undervalued at a P/FFO ratio of 9.6, and a dividend yield of 4.7%  into one of the REITs with high returns.Prologis (PLD)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comInvestors looking for exposure to not just U.S. industrial real estate, but global industrial real estate, should consider owning Prologis (NYSE:PLD). This REIT is one of the world’s largest owners of logistics real estate such as warehouses. When it comes to REITs and long-term investing, PLD stock is a strong choice. While shares may trade at a premium valuation (P/FFO of 24.5) compared to most REITs, and offer a forward yield of just 2.79%, Prologis’ growth prospects may more than make up for it. Although other types of real estate have experienced headwinds lately, industrial real estate demand remains robust.Prologis recently raised its outlook due to these positive trends. Beyond organic growth, management continues to pursue valuation creation efforts like the acquisition/development of new properties. All of this could fuel strong price appreciation for PLD in the years ahead.W.P. Carey (WPC)hand of person in a suit dangling keys with a house symbol on the ring. Windows overlooking city skyline in background.Source: ImageFlow/shutterstock.comW.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) is another of the large triple-net lease REITs. However, unlike NNN REIT or Realty Income, WPC has a more broad base of single-tenant real estate assets. Rather than focusing on just retail triple-net lease properties, the REIT owns a mix of office, retail, and industrial real estate.WPC is also a specialist in sale/leaseback transactions. While NNN and O may themselves be strong investment opportunities, WPC stock could be a stronger candidate when it comes to REITs with high returns. Not only does WPC trade at an lower multiple (12.3) than these other net lease names. W.P. Carey also has a higher forward dividend yield, nearing 6%. At the same time, as Sure Dividend’s Bob Ciura has argued, WPC’s diversified, recession-resistant assets, with build-in rent increases tied to CPI, give it strong potential to generate “lucrative total returns over the long term.”On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Kforce KFRC, Robert Half International RHI, Staffing 360 Solutions STAF and Kelly Services KELYA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Gain as U.S. Job Market Remains on Solid FootingThe U.S. economy quite successfully churned out jobs in April despite the Federal Reserve's policies to cool the economy. The U.S. labor market showed resilience amid the ongoing banking crisis and elevated inflation.The Labor Department added that nonfarm payrolls increased by 253,000 last month, the best gain since January, and easily surpassed analysts' estimate of growth of 180,000.Hiring in April, in reality, was robust and reversed a cooling trend that had marked the first three months of the year. Job gains were primarily strong in professional and business services, healthcare, leisure, and hospitality, to name a few.While employers in the United States added 43,000 jobs in the professional and services field, healthcare saw 40,000 job gains. That was followed by 31,000 job additions in the leisure and hospitality field.What's more, 23,000 jobs were added in the troubled banking industry. Let us not forget that the Silicon Valley Bank collapsed due to run-on deposits, and it led to a contagion effect, which in due course impacted banks such as Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.Government hiring also increased by 23,000. Overall, hiring was much stronger in areas that had earlier faced labor shortages than rate-sensitive areas, including manufacturing and retail.Hiring in April bounced back from downwardly revised job additions in March and February. Employers added fewer jobs in the previous months amid moderate economic growth.Story continuesIn the first quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) advanced at an annualized pace of 1.1%, less than economists' estimate of growth of 2%. This is also less than the 2.6% annualized growth in the fourth quarter of last year.Nonetheless, the unemployment rate came in at 3.4% in April, down from March's 3.5%, and matched the lowest reading since 1969, added the Labor Department. The jobless rate for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all declined.Now, with employers adding jobs at a strong clip in April, and reversing a cooling trend, shares of staffing companies are undoubtedly poised to gain. This is because staffing players are the direct beneficiaries of job additions.Additionally, the leading indicator of future employment growth increased in April, something that bodes well for staffing stock as well. The Employment Trends Index of the Conference Board increased to 116.18 in April, up from March's downwardly revised 115.51. Thus, we have highlighted four staffing stocks that are worth a look now.Kforce provides professional staffing services and solutions to clients on both a temporary and permanent basis through the Technology Finance and Accounting segments.KFRC, currently, has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company's expected earnings growth rate for next year is 11.5%. KFRC's shares have already gained 19.8% in the past five-year period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Robert Half International is one of the world's largest providers of professional consulting and staffing services.RHI, currently, has a Zacks Rank #3. The company's expected earnings growth rate for next year is 17.8%. RHI's shares have already gained 15.1% in the past five years.Staffing 360 Solutions is engaged in a global buy-and-build strategy through the acquisition of staffing organizations in the United States.STAF, currently, has a Zacks Rank #3. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is 121.1%. STAF's expected earnings growth rate for the next quarter is nearly 114%.Kelly Services is a global leader in providing workforce solutions. It has offices located in major cities in the United States.KELYA, currently, has a Zacks Rank #3. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year are 3.8% and 37.7%, respectively.

272,58a4b617-4111-3838-ac8b-7cbc4e51d159,UPS,2023-05-12,"Is United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (NYSE:UPS) 54% ROE Better Than Average?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-nyse-ups-140015046.html,1683813615,STORY,['UPS'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:54% = US$11b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.54.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, United Parcel Service has a higher ROE than the average (16%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for United Parcel Service by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining United Parcel Service's Debt And Its 54% Return On EquityUnited Parcel Service clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.09. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MLM that show why this seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MLM, shares are up 9.49% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry is up 1.85% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 15.86% compares favorably with the industry's 3.4% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Martin Marietta have increased 4.74% over the past quarter, and have gained 24.68% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.53% and 5.1%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to MLM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. MLM is currently averaging 336,297 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with MLM.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MLM's consensus estimate, increasing from $14.84 to $15.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MLM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Martin Marietta on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let’s be real: Biden doesn’t have the greatest approval rating. And he’s old – astonishingly old. Nevertheless, he does have a solid chance of winning the White House again. And that bodes well for the blue-collar sector because of Biden and construction industry dynamics.Obviously, Biden initially ran on the campaign promise to build back better. And he helped make good on that promise via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. With a second term, Biden may bring some predictability to the political order. Further, reports about the construction industry analysis in 2023 point toward the pursuit of growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. There’s a better chance of that happening if Biden wins.Still, how can anyone be so confident about his reelection? As The Guardian pointed out, the Republicans are internally divided. You have small-government Republicans (remember those guys?), Trump hardliners and the “Fringe” (it’s better I don’t explain). For the Democrats, you only have President Biden and “Dark Brandon.” It’s just a more cogent framework. Here are the top construction companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMLMMartin Marietta Materials$397.66MASMasco$53.45VMCVulcan Materials$193.57CATCaterpillar$215.09DEDeere$381.09URIUnited Rentals$342.05KELYAKelly Services$16.24Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) is a supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, with operations spanning 26 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. Notably, Martin Marietta supplies resources for the construction of roads, sidewalks, and foundations. Presently, it features a market capitalization of $24.65 billion. Since the start of the year, MLM gained an impressive 15%, making it one of the best construction stocks to buy now.Story continuesOn the financials, Martin Marietta benefits from solid operational statistics. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.3%, above 68.87% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 12.4%, above 64.09% of sector rivals. On the bottom line, the company posts a trailing-year net margin of 14.07%, outflanking 82.64% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg MLM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $418.50, implying almost 8% upside potential.Masco (MAS)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAn American manufacturer of products for the home improvement and new home construction markets, Masco (NYSE:MAS) is a bit of a risk when compared to other top construction companies to invest in. Largely, MAS depends on sentiment for renovation and real estate acquisition. That’s questionable given rising layoffs and interest rates. Nevertheless, for contrarians, MAS could rank among the best construction stocks to buy now.Indeed, the market carries optimism, with shares bouncing over 11% since the Jan. opener. Operationally, Masco enjoys encouraging stats. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 17.1%, ranked above 84.26% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period lands at 13.4%, above 67.44%. On the bottom line, Masco prints an excellent trailing-year net margin of 9.67%, beating out 82.91% of the competition. As with Martin Marietta, Masco benefits from consistent profitability.Lastly, covering analysts peg MAS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $57.92, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Vulcan Materials (VMC)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHailing from Birmingham, Alabama, Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates— primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel — and a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, according to its website. Because of the Biden and construction industry relationship, VMC popped up 8% since the beginning of this year.Investors may look forward to additional gains as VMC ranks among the best construction stocks to buy now. Primarily, Vulcan enjoys strong sales performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above 80.44% of its rivals. On the bottom line, Vulcan features an operating margin and net margin of 13.79% and 7.87%, respectively. Both stats rank above at least 65% of sector peers.To close out, analysts peg VMC as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 10 buys, two holds and zero sells. Overall, the experts’ average price target is $209, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Caterpillar (CAT)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA world-famous construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is no stranger to lists targeting the best construction stocks to buy now. However, it’s interesting at this juncture because of the Biden and construction industry dynamics. In the runup to the 2016 presidential election, former President Donald Trump often praised Caterpillar. However, CAT represents a contrarian play, with shares down 12% since the January opener.To be fair, many of its fiscal stats sit as rather ho-hum: not bad, not great. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 5.7%, better than 54% of its peers. That’s nice but nothing earth-shattering. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the aforementioned period is 9.2%, better than 50.43% of sector players. Again, nothing remarkable.However, Caterpillar offers business predictability. Its operating margin and net margin ping at 15.73% and 11.53%, ranking better than at least 87% of other construction stocks. Currently, analysts peg CAT as a hold. On average, the experts anticipate shares hitting $239.07, implying growth potential of almost 14%.Deere (DE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Specializing in the manufacture of agricultural machinery, Deere (NYSE:DE) is a key player in heavy equipment, forestry machinery, diesel engines, drivetrains used in heavy equipment, and lawn care equipment. Given the Democrats’ holistic view of infrastructure, the need to boost food-related supply chains should undergird this special category of the best construction stocks to buy now. Since the start of the year, DE lost 12% of its equity value.However, such red ink seems rather unreasonable given the broader fiscal picture. Operationally, Deere’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 11.7%, beating out nearly 72% of its peers. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 18.6%, above 72.46%. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin lands at 14.9%, ranked better than 92% of sector players. Also, it enjoys consistent profitability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $470.15, implying nearly 26% upside potential.United Rentals (URI)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBilled as the world’s largest equipment rental company, United Rentals (NYSE:URI) owns approximately 4,700 classes of equipment. In addition, United offers a combined total of over 1,400 locations covering North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Should President Biden win reelection, construction demand might soar, boding well for equipment providers.Enticingly, the market prices URI at a forward multiple of 7.93. As a discount to projected earnings, United ranks better than 82.78% of the competition. Also, URI trades at 4.86 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 10.91 times. Operationally, United posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.9%, ranked better than 71.89% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the aforementioned period is 25.5%, outpacing nearly 85% of the field.Looking to the Street, analysts peg URI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $421.83, implying over 28% upside potential. Though it’s a higher risk, it makes a solid case for the best construction stocks to buy now.Kelly Services (KELYA)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAn office staffing company featuring global operations, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might not immediately figure as one of the top construction companies to invest in. However, Kelly provides staffing solutions for myriad industries, including the construction sector. And frankly, building back better doesn’t mean much if companies don’t have anyone to do so.To be fair, KELYA represents one of the higher-risk stories among construction stocks, with shares down 7% year-to-date. Still, it could attract speculators because of its value proposition. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 9.99. As a discount to projected earnings, Kelly ranks better than 72.19% of the competition. Also, KELYA trades at 0.63 times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median is a lofty 2.14 times.On the balance sheet, Kelly enjoys a cash-to-debt ratio of 2.18, above 61.56% of its peers. However, it had some troubles regarding negative sales growth and net margin. Nevertheless, an improved construction sector outlook could do wonders for the enterprise. On a final note, analysts peg KELYA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $24, implying over 52% growth potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.Billionaire Warren Buffett has time and again proved that he is truly peerless when it comes to investing. His simple style and relentless repetition of age-old, tried and tested and sometimes cliché investing principles make it all look easy. And it seems Buffett’s true genius shines when things are going south for the broader markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that Berkshire also outperforms during recessions and bears markets. The firm says that Berkshire shares have beaten the market for no less than six recessions since 1980 by a median of 4.41 percentage points.During the same time period, Berkshire Hathaway, which is up about 4.5% year to date through May 10, surpassed S&amp;P 500 each time it dropped 20%, beating the broader index by a median of 14.89 percentage points.There are many lessons that could be drawn from decades of jaw-dropping outperformance of the Oracle of Omaha. But the most important and relevant of these is Buffett’s focus on dividends.$5.7 Billion in Cash in a Single YearAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, which cites an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is expected to generate $5.7 billion in cash from its stock portfolio in 2023. Most of this would be coming from dividends. The WSJ report said that a major chunk of this cash would come from some famous dividend stocks that Buffett has huge stakes in.About $1.1 billion would be coming from Chevron, in which Buffett has a huge stake (more on that later in the article). The WSJ report also mentioned that Buffett would collect $700 million each from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while the Oracle of Omaha will collect about $500 million from Kraft Heinz. From American Express, the billionaire’s check would give him about $363 million.Story continuesAll of this looks very simple at the surface. Just find famous dividend companies, invest in them and collect your payments, right? But if it were that simple Warren Buffett would lose his charm and charisma and the world won’t line up to listen to his advice.Buffett's Secret Sauce: ""The Weeds Wither Away in Significance as the Flowers Bloom""In a letter penned last year, Warren Buffett told about his “secret” of success in dividend investing under a heading “The Secret Sauce.” Buffett’s words sum up decades of wisdom and his foresight.Here’s what he said:""In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""There are several other dividend stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in addition to the famous dividend-paying companies we mentioned above. In this article we are going to take a look at all of the important dividend-paying companies in Buffett's portfolio. Dividend payments from these companies would help the legendary investor get $5.7 billion in cash this year.Warren Buffett's Top Dividend PicksOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Berkshire’s 13F portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top dividend-paying companies in which the fund had stakes.

Regional and mid-sized banks are struggling as depositors are increasingly pulling their money out and households and businesses are subsequently finding it more difficult to get loans as banks tighten regulations and keep their eyes on their balance sheets.However, as Business Insider reminded us, up to $250,000 per depositor is safe at financial institutions that are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) — or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)-insured. This is true whether the bank or credit union is national, regional or local.Asset-heavy, diversified and regulated banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank and U.S. Bank are among the safest banks in the U.S. and should be considered if you are weighing your options. But if you’re looking for security and competitive savings rates, you would be wise to check out the following three financial institutions, says Insider. AllyWith a Better Business Bureau rating of A, Ally Bank offers a wide range of financial products and services, including checking and savings accounts, mortgage loans, retirement accounts, auto loans and personal loans. Savings account rates are competitive and there are no monthly maintenance fees to open a savings account and no minimum deposit requirements. Ally also has great 24/7 phone, live chat or email service in lieu of physical branches and offers a guarantee against unauthorized access.Story continuesAlly currently offers the following accounts:Ally High Yield Savings AccountAlly Interest Checking AccountAlly High Yield CDsAlly Raise Your Rate CDAlly No Penalty CDAlly Money Market AccountCapital OneCapital One 360 is a popular option for online banking if you’re looking for savings accounts, checking accounts or CDs — it also has physical branches if that is a banking preference.

There are no monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements for savings accounts. In the event that you think your account’s security has been breached, Capital One offers their customers debit card blocking, which stops activity on their debit cards if it looks like it has been stolen, lost or sold to a third party.Here are some current Capital One accounts to consider:Capital One 360 Performance SavingsCapital One CheckingCapital One 360 CDsDiscover BankKnown primarily for its credit cards, Discover is also a full-service bank and payment services company.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Quickly Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has managed to grow EPS by 29% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While Vertex Pharmaceuticals did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Vertex Pharmaceuticals' future profits.Story continuesAre Vertex Pharmaceuticals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$90b company like Vertex Pharmaceuticals. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$214m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Vertex Pharmaceuticals' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Vertex Pharmaceuticals' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 12.61 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 23.42. TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.68 and as low as 12.61, with a median of 14.85, all within the past year.Investors should also note that TXT holds a PEG ratio of 1.13. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TXT's industry has an average PEG of 1.55 right now. Within the past year, TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.16.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.01. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.16.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that TXT has a P/CF ratio of 10.78. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 41.85. Within the past 12 months, TXT's P/CF has been as high as 13 and as low as 10.05, with a median of 11.74.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Textron's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, TXT looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Norfolk Southern crews responded immediately and remain on-site cleaning up.The U.S. Justice Department and state of Ohio have sued Norfolk Southern seeking to ensure that the railroad pays the full cost of cleanup and any long-term effects of the derailment in Ohio of one of its freight trains in early February.That derailment and the subsequent fire that sent a cloud of smoke with billowing black plumes over the town of East Palestineoutraged the thousands of residentswho were forced to evacuate.Since then some of East Palestine's 4,700 residents have reported ailments such as rashes and breathing difficulties, and some fear long-term health effects. They have pressed government officials to push for accountability.Since December 2021, NTSB has launched investigations into at least six significant accidents involving Norfolk Southern, including the East Palestine incident. In March, the safety board said it was opening a special investigation into the railroad and its safety practices and culture and urged ""the company to take immediate action today to review and assess its safety practices.""That special investigation was opened the same day a Norfolk Southern conductor in Clevelandwas killedStory continueswhen a train was struck by a dump truck.In early March, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) said it would conduct a 60-day supplemental safety assessment of Norfolk Southern.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in March FRA would use information collected ""to push Norfolk Southern to develop measures to mitigate risks while identifying appropriate enforcement actions"" and will issue a public report. That report has not yet been released.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw vowed in March to ""to rebuild our safety culture from the ground up. We are going to invest more in safety. This is not who we are, it is not acceptable, and it will not continue.""Norfolk Southern said Tuesdayit would establish a fundto reimburse homeowners who live near the East Palestine derailment site who sell their homes for less than what the property was worth before the incident.

289,1b434a06-7124-37a9-aed3-656989b8fd8c,NSC,2023-05-12,Shake Shack and Community Bancshares have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shake-shack-community-bancshares-highlighted-114811158.html,1683805691,STORY,"['SHAK', 'NSC', 'UNP', 'DCOM']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Shake Shack SHAK as the Bull of the Day and Community Bancshares DCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Union Pacific Corp. UNP and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Shake Shack, the fast-food hamburger and milkshake chain is on a tear this year, and it looks like the bull run may have just begun. Shake Shack boasts a compelling trade setup with top a Zacks Ranks, convincing technical chart patterns, and improving business fundamentals.SHAK currently scores a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. It has also benefited from the recent strength of the Retail – Restaurant industry, which is currently in the top 18% of the Zacks Industry Rank, outperforming the broad market YTD.Company DescriptionShake Shack serves elevated versions of American classic foods, with high quality ingredients. It is primarily known for its burgers, chicken sandwiches, hand-spun milkshakes, and house-made lemonade. The first Shake Shack location opened in 2004 in New York City and has grown to approximately 460 locations today.The company operates 436 restaurants, including 254 domestic company-operated locations and 33 domestic-licensed locations. Additionally, there are 149 international-licensed restaurants. SHAK also operates an impressive mobile app through which diners can order meals before arriving at the restaurant.Q1 EarningsLast week, Shake Shack reported Q1 earnings, and results came in better than expected. Earnings for the quarter were -$0.01 per share, beating estimates of -$0.09 per share. Sales for the quarter came in at $253 million, up 24.5% YoY and beating analysts' estimates of $246 million.SHAK was also able to improve several key business metrics. Same store sales were up 10.3%, led by higher menu prices and double-digit traffic growth. This increase brings average weekly sales to $73,000. Additionally, operating margins have increased 310 basis points in the last year, bringing them up to 18.3%.Story continuesThe company opened six new domestic, company-operated locations and seven new licensed restaurants including locations in Mexico and China.Investors were clearly happy with the earnings beat as shares rallied tremendously following the report. Shares are up 20% following the earnings report, and SHAK stock is now up 60% YTD.Shake Shack has grown at an impressive pace over the past decade. Sales have climbed nearly 10x from just $110 million in 2014 to over $950 million today.Technical SetupShake Shack stock just broke out of an extremely compelling chart pattern. After drawing in investors, and building out a year long base, SHAK has broken out of a bull flag consolidation.Although the technical setup has already been completed, the close at the top of the range, followed by another weekly gap up is a bullish signal. From a technical perspective SHAK is a convincing investment, and any pullbacks are good buying opportunities.ValuationShake Shack is trading at a trailing twelve-month Price to EBITDA ratio of 34x, which is below its five-year median of 35x, and well above the industry average 15x. It should be noted that SHAK has traded at a significant premium to the industry for the entirety of its time as a public company.When compared directly to a competitor of a similar caliber SHAK's valuation makes more sense. Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, which is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has a very comparable valuation. Trading at 34x TTM Price to EBITDA, CMG is right in line with SHAK. Both provide innovative, high-quality offerings and are some of the fastest growing companies in their respective sectors.Bottom LineShake Shack has a lot going for it today. With improving business economics, growing same-store sales, increased traffic, improving earnings estimates, and strong technical momentum SHAK is a worthy consideration for any investor's portfolio.Bear of the Day:It is no secret that the regional banking sector is under considerable pressure, and Dime Community Bancshares has not been excluded. DCOM is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, indicating downward trending earnings revisions. DCOM also has some unfavorable banking metrics I want to draw attention to.Dime Community Bancshares Inc. is the holding company for Dime Community Bank. It provides deposit and loan products and financial services to local businesses, consumers, and municipalities.DCOM stock is being sold aggressively, considerably underperforming the sector and halving in value over the last five years.Earnings ResultsDime Community Bancshares experienced some brief solace following its earnings results at the end of April, however that strength was only an opportunity for more selling. DCOM managed to beat earnings estimates, but it wasn't enough to stop the selling.Earnings of $0.92 per share beat Zacks Estimates of $0.82 per share. However, sales of $94.75 million missed estimates of $99 million. It is worth noting that because of the environment, DCOM estimates had been revised considerably lower leading up to the report. So, while earnings beat estimates, they were a much lower target, and sales couldn't reach even the lower expectations.Future earnings expectations haven't improved either. Analysts are in unanimous agreement in downgrading DCOM across timeframes. Q2 earnings have been downgraded by -30% over just the last 60 days. Huge revisions lower in estimates are exactly what bears want to see.ConcernsThe Q1 earnings report also showed some concerning data regarding deposits. As much as 30% of DCOM's bank deposits were non-insured, leaving it potentially vulnerable in the case of a run on the bank. Deposits did increase from $10.25 billion to $10.57 billion in the quarter though, which is very reassuring.There was an additional balance sheet metric that caught my attention. A line labeled ""accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI),"" shows a -$98 million loss.One of the major pieces of data that initially caused concern regarding Silicon Valley Bank before its downfall was unrealized losses on securities. SIVB was holding a ton of long-dated Treasuries on its balance sheet, and when interest rates rose in 2022, the value of those securities dropped. SIVB reported a loss of -$1.8 billion because of this, which led them to try and raise capital through a share offering. It was never completed.Unrealized losses on securities are included in that AOCI figure, meaning DCOM is holding securities that are underwater. I want to make this extremely clear, SIVB didn't fail because of its unrealized losses, and neither will Dime Bancshares, but it was and is a concerning figure.As it currently stands, AOCI as a percentage of total stockholders' equity is -8.2%. When Silicon Valley Bank went under that number was -11.7%. Again, this isn't an alarm that should cause the stock to crash, but a red flag.ValuationDime Community Bancshares is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6x, which is below the industry average 8x, and below its four-year median of 9.5x. The tremendous fall in share price is what has caused the valuation to fall so precipitously from last year.During the most recent quarterly report management announced that they were raising the dividend payment from $0.24 per quarter to $0.25, which they believe reflects a strong financial position. DCOM has an annual dividend yield of 5.9%.Bottom LineDCOM is in a very challenging position. Not only is it caught up in one of the worst national bank scares since the Savings and Loan Crisis, but it also displays some concerning financial metrics to back those fears. Fortunately for them, the deposit base remains at the bank quelling the worst fears, but analysts are still bearish. While there is no evidence DCOM should suffer the same fate as SIVB, it is likely to continue to see downward pressure, and should thus be avoided.Additional content:2 Dividend-Paying Railroad Stocks You Can Count OnThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry continues to suffer from headwinds like raging inflation, higher interest rates, increased fuel price and supply-chain disruptions. Even though oil price has declined (down 5.7% in the January-March period) due to recession fears, it remains high. Since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, an uptick in fuel costs is not a welcome development. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 3.9% over the past six months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index's 4% appreciation and 0.7% decline of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Union Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $121.90 billion.UNP pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.30 ($5.20 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.60% yield at the current stock price. This company's payout ratio is 45% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.02%. (Check Union Pacific's dividend history here).We are impressed with Union Pacific's consistent efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company hiked its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP's board of directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.30 per share. Notably, Union Pacific has been paying dividends on its common stock for 123 consecutive years.During first-quarter 2023, UNP paid dividends worth $795 million and repurchased shares worth $575 million. In 2022, UNP paid dividends worth $3,159 million and repurchased shares worth $6,282 million. For 2023, management continues to anticipate a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings).Norfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $47.14 billion.NSC pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.35 ($5.40 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.61% yield at the current stock price. This company's payout ratio is 38% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 11.95%. (Check Norfolk Southern's dividend history here).We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In January 2023, the company's board announced a dividend hike of 9%, thereby raising its quarterly dividend payout from $1.24 per share to $1.35. During first-quarter 2023, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $307 million and repurchased and retired 0.6 million shares for $163 million.During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million. In 2021, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,028 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,390 million. Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company's commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors' confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.Billionaire Warren Buffett has time and again proved that he is truly peerless when it comes to investing. His simple style and relentless repetition of age-old, tried and tested and sometimes cliché investing principles make it all look easy. And it seems Buffett’s true genius shines when things are going south for the broader markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that Berkshire also outperforms during recessions and bears markets. The firm says that Berkshire shares have beaten the market for no less than six recessions since 1980 by a median of 4.41 percentage points.During the same time period, Berkshire Hathaway, which is up about 4.5% year to date through May 10, surpassed S&amp;P 500 each time it dropped 20%, beating the broader index by a median of 14.89 percentage points.There are many lessons that could be drawn from decades of jaw-dropping outperformance of the Oracle of Omaha. But the most important and relevant of these is Buffett’s focus on dividends.$5.7 Billion in Cash in a Single YearAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, which cites an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is expected to generate $5.7 billion in cash from its stock portfolio in 2023. Most of this would be coming from dividends. The WSJ report said that a major chunk of this cash would come from some famous dividend stocks that Buffett has huge stakes in.About $1.1 billion would be coming from Chevron, in which Buffett has a huge stake (more on that later in the article). The WSJ report also mentioned that Buffett would collect $700 million each from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while the Oracle of Omaha will collect about $500 million from Kraft Heinz. From American Express, the billionaire’s check would give him about $363 million.Story continuesAll of this looks very simple at the surface. Just find famous dividend companies, invest in them and collect your payments, right? But if it were that simple Warren Buffett would lose his charm and charisma and the world won’t line up to listen to his advice.Buffett's Secret Sauce: ""The Weeds Wither Away in Significance as the Flowers Bloom""In a letter penned last year, Warren Buffett told about his “secret” of success in dividend investing under a heading “The Secret Sauce.” Buffett’s words sum up decades of wisdom and his foresight.Here’s what he said:""In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""There are several other dividend stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in addition to the famous dividend-paying companies we mentioned above. In this article we are going to take a look at all of the important dividend-paying companies in Buffett's portfolio. Dividend payments from these companies would help the legendary investor get $5.7 billion in cash this year.Warren Buffett's Top Dividend PicksOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Berkshire’s 13F portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top dividend-paying companies in which the fund had stakes.

294,09d1642f-7133-306b-955b-46de5b08b7f4,WM,2023-05-12,7 Must-Buy Stocks to Create a Crash-Proof Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-must-buy-stocks-create-170031975.html,1683478831,STORY,"['SRE', 'CVS', 'HD', 'FIVE', 'WM', 'PG', 'PGR']","[Although I’m not trying to alarm anyone, investors may want to consider so-called crash-proof stocks. These are enterprises that enjoy both analyst support and command reliable, predictable businesses. By nature, they’re boring and with perhaps only one exception, will likely not yield gargantuan returns. Nevertheless, they should help keep the lights on in your portfolio.Fundamentally, investors must at least consider the best stocks to buy before a crash if they intend to stay in the market. Worryingly, a MarketWatch op-ed warned that if you’re a student of history, the bank failures we suffered may only be the beginning. On a personal note, I’m note sure how the experts can be so calm about the situation, other than perhaps not wanting to spark a mass panic. Again, that’s not what I’m trying to do here. However, it’s probably prudent to learn how to create a crash-proof portfolio, particularly with safe stocks for long-term investors. Here are some ideas to consider.WMWaste Management$168.43PGProcter &amp; Gamble$156.03SRESempra Energy$154.92FIVEFive Below$195.80PGRProgressive$129.52HDHome Depot$289.62CVSCVS. Health$70.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWaste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to the subject of how to create a crash-proof portfolio, investors should focus on indispensable services. I can’t think of a better enterprise in that regard than Waste Management (NYSE:WM). As many observers point out, we live in a consumer-driven economy. Therefore, we’re constantly buying stuff and getting rid of it. Unfortunately, matter just doesn’t disappear, which is where Waste Management comes in.Financially, the company benefits from a predictable business profile, to no one’s surprise. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 9.5%, above 63.45% of sector players. On the bottom line, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 11.33%, outflanking 72.22% of the field. As well, Waste Management is an extremely high-quality enterprise, as determined by its lofty return on equity (ROE) of 32.27%.Story continuesFinally, analysts peg WM as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as five buys and six holds. Overall, the experts’ price target lands at $172.40, implying nearly 3% upside potential. Thanks to its critical business, WM makes a case for crash-proof stocks to buy.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockA consumer goods giant, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) easily ranks among the best stocks to buy before a crash. Obviously, investors received a harsh lesson of its relevancy during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even with the mysterious SARS-CoV-2 virus floating around seemingly ready to strike, people hounded grocery stores and similar retailers in the hunt for toilet paper. Put another way, people will buy the essentials, come hell or high water.Financially, Procter &amp; Gamble doesn’t offer the most remarkable of financial profiles. But the important point is that it gets the job done. Notably, the company benefits from a decent balance sheet, particularly its Altman Z-Score of 5.36. This indicates high fiscal stability and low bankruptcy risk.On the bottom line, P&amp;G really comes alive. Its trailing-year net margin comes in at 17.69%, ranked better than 91.66% of the field. Also, its ROE prints an incredibly robust 31.72%. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $165.82, implying nearly 7% upside potential. It may be boring but it’s also one of the crash-proof stocks.Sempra Energy (SRE)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOne of the top utility companies in the nation, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) makes a viable case for cash-proof stocks for two key reasons. First, Sempra benefits from a natural monopoly. Basically, the barrier to entry is so steep that would-be competitors don’t even try.Second, Sempra accrues organic rewards for targeting segments of the ultra-lucrative Southern California market. Sure, you hear a bunch of partisan chatter about the Golden State being incredibly expensive, forcing to migrate out. But so many people are moving in, which makes Sempra a gold mine among safe stocks for long-term investors. Financially, Sempra doesn’t offer a remarkable profile, much like other utilities. However, it enjoys a robust net margin and consistent profitability. To close out, analysts peg SRE a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $169.67, implying almost 11% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA chain of specialty discount stores, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is a step above in terms of that categorization. Rather than focusing exclusively on products that sell for a buck or less, most of its inventory sell for less than $5, hence the name. Also, Five Below features a small assortment of products from $6 to $25, offering a bargain hunt for all shoppers. It’s a compelling example of crash-proof stocks.Financially, the company prints excellent growth stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.8%, above 81.67% of sector rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 18.6%, above 66.78%. On the bottom line, Five Below’s net margin impresses at 8.5%, outflanking 81.39% of its peers. Notably, it enjoys a high-quality business with an ROE of 22%. Therefore, it could be one of the top stocks to survive a market crash, both for its fiscal performance and for its relevancy.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg FIVE a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $224.63, implying almost 16% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For investors seeking crash-proof stocks, you don’t need to look much further than Progressive (NYSE:PGR). Obviously, insurance companies like Progressive present an incredibly boring profile. However, boring is good during times of uncertainty. Plus, the sector stalwart – known mostly for its auto insurance policies – benefits from a captive audience.Basically, almost every state in the Union requires drivers to hold auto insurance. Plus, whether mandated or not, having insurance just makes good logical sense, particularly in the post-pandemic environment. To be sure, prospective investors should note that PGR lost about 3% since the January opener. Unfortunately, it incurred recent volatility. Nevertheless, the core relevancy of its business should help PGR gradually rise higher.Another factor to consider is that its financials don’t exactly stand out. However, the company posts solid revenue growth and consistent profitability. Looking to the Street, analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy.

Specifically, he warned that bankruptcies may continue accelerating or continue shrinking their physical footprint. While that might impact Home Depot as well, I believe the company stands a bit above the rest.Fundamentally, we’re not just dealing with a discretionary retailer but also an enterprise that delivers valuable services. I’ve mentioned this before but back during the Covid-19 crisis, Home Depot kept its doors open for longer than other retailers to help folks get through the calamity. The company also acts as a critical goods supplier during periods of natural disasters.Financially, Home Depot commands a solid top line with a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.2%. This stat ranks above 78.79% of other retailers. Also, its net margin comes in at 10.87%, above 87% of the field. Lastly, analysts peg HD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $337.78, implying over 18% upside potential.CVS Health (CVS)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA healthcare company best known for its retail pharmacy chain, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) could make a case for crash-proof stocks because it represents a necessity. From prescription drugs to over-the-counter meds, CVS provides to everyone’s health-related needs. And since demand remains consistent and largely predictable, the company enjoys cynical upside.However, CVS stock has been incredibly volatile this year. Although the underlying enterprise beat first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, management lowered its guidance for the full year. Naturally, investors didn’t care for that too much. Since the January opener, CVS slipped 26%.Nevertheless, for the intrepid contrarian, the company may be undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.69. As a discount to projected earnings, CVS ranks better than 88.89% of the competition. On a final note, analysts peg CVS as a consensus strong buy. On average, the experts’ price target comes in at $102.60, implying over 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is an American financial software company that specializes in the development of financial, accounting and tax preparation software for small businesses, accountants and individuals. It's well known for its legacy products such as QuickBooks and TurboTax.Intuit was founded in 1983 by Scott Cook and Tom Proulx in Palo Alto, California. The idea for Intuit came about after Cook realized that personal computers would change the way people did personal accounting. Intuit went public in 1993,Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTU. Click here to check it out. INTU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of INTUPeter Lynch Chart of INTUIn recent years, the company has been expanding its product portfolio through acquisitions, most notably MailChimp and CreditKarma. However, they haven't actually grown the bottom line much so far, resulting in an inflated valuation. I believe it's only a matter of time before Intuit's acquisitions really pay off, though, because said acquisitions help to reinforce the company's competitive advantages.Product offeringsFirst, let's take a look at Intuit's core products, both legacy and acquired. Starting with legacy, QuickBooks is a comprehensive accounting software package geared towards small and medium-sized businesses. It offers on-premises accounting applications as well as cloud-based versions that accept business payments, manage and pay bills and perform payroll functions.TurboTax, acquired way back in 1993 so it's borderline a legacy product, is a software package for American tax preparation. It's one of the most popular income tax preparation software packages in the United States, with versions for both individual consumers and professional tax preparers.Mint is a free web-based personal financial management service for the U.S. and Canada. Mint brings all financial accounts together online or on your mobile device, automatically categorizes transactions, lets you set budgets and helps you achieve your savings goals. Intuit acquired Mint in 2009 for a reported $170 million.Story continuesOn the recent acquisition side, Credit Karma is a financial technology company offering a suite of personal finance tools and services. The platform provides users with free access to their credit scores and reports, credit monitoring services, personalized financial product recommendations and a free online tax filing service. It also offers a high-yield savings account and a variety of educational resources on credit, loans and personal finance. Intuit paid roughly $7.1 billion in cash and stock for the company in 2020.Another recent acquisition, MailChimp started as an email marketing service and platform and has since expanded its offerings to provide a complete marketing platform for small businesses. Its services now include not only email marketing but also social media and digital ads, landing pages, customer relationship management tools and analytics. Intuit bought MailChimp for approximately $12 billion - half cash, half stock - in 2021.In the last few years alone, the company has added more than $12 billion in goodwill and more than $6 billion in long-term debt to its balance sheet. The underperformance of CreditKarma is likely to curtail earnings growth in the upcoming quarters with the revenue excepted to decline by more than 10% in 2023. The consumer financial platform made up to 14% of the total fiscal 2022 revenue in its first full year. At MailChimp, revenue was $800 million in 2022, accounting for 5.8% of Intuits top line.Collectively, I believe Intuit paid too much for both of these businesses in a pandemic-driven buying frenzy, but only time will tell if their competitive advantages will outweigh the high cost.Legacy offerings remain strongThe TurboTax franchise, a significant revenue driver for Intuit, is projected to have a 10% increase in earnings per share during the tax season. The unit's continual sales gains over recent years can be attributed to a better live assistance experience.More importantly, the future still looks extremely promising at Intuit's self-employed and small business segment. The company emains committed to innovating and enhancing functionality around QuickBooks, which generates a little more than half of Intuit's revenue. These improvements are aimed at efficiency of small businesses. Further enhancements to working capital management tools, including superior invoicing, bill payments and automation, are also contributing to sales growth.QuickBooks Online now has 4.5 million users and has an estimated market share of nearly 80% for small businesses utilizing financial software as well as a 79% retention rate, according to Morningstar.High switching costs associated with QuickBooks helps Intuit keep these users, whether theyre happy or not. Changing accounting software means re-establishing third-party services and re-linking point-of-sale application with bookkeeping software, integrating payroll data and even re-training.With QuickBooks being compatible with nearly 700 applications, plus having the capital to continue improving regardless of new competition, its dominance seems very durable.High valuation, incredible value creationIntuit's stock is trading at a forward rice-earnings ratio of 27, which is a little on the high side, but that's understandable due to the company's high profitability and top-line growth. The gross margin is 79%, the three-year revenue per share growth rate is 20.4% and the three-year earnings per share growth rate is 7.3%. Sometimes, investors have to pay up for quality, and since I expect the bottom line to eventually catch up with the top line growth following the acquisition spree, the stock could become even hotter in the coming years.Growth has been fairly consistent in the long-term as well. Through the past decade, total annual revenue at Intuit has increased from $3.9 billion to more than $13.6 billion. During that decade of growth, net income grew as well, albeit slightly less, from $858 million to over $1.9 billion. Intuit saw a rise of $104 billion in market value on just $8 billion in retained earnings.With the companys latest acquisitions set to eventually bear fruit and its legacy products looking to retain high market share for decades to come, I would be shocked if the company doesn't continue to produce $13 in market value for every $1 it retains.However, lets say this ratio is cut in half and in the next decade Intuit only grows net profit at the same 8.5% annualized rate as it did over the last decade. It would add north of $18 billion in retained earnings to its books, which could translate into an additional $115 billion in market value.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Along with protein shakes, BellRing offers other RTD beverages, powders, nutrition bars, and supplements.Q2 Review: BellRing easily topped its Q2 EPS expectations by 14% at $0.24 per share compared to EPS estimates of $0.21. This was up 4% from the prior-year quarter. Second-quarter sales beat estimates by 4% at $385.60 million, and climbed 22% from Q2 2022.More intriguing, BellRing has now topped earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters with earnings estimate revisions starting to trend higher for the nutrition guru.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBellRing’s growth and earnings potential is starting to look more attractive since the company launched its IPO in 2019. Trading at $35 a share, BellRing’s earnings are now forecasted to rise 8% this year and climb another 20% in FY24 at $1.51 per share. Plus, fiscal 2024 EPS projections would represent 147% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $0.61 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDaVita (DVA)Another medical stock that looks attractive at the moment is DaVita Inc which sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). DaVita’s Medical-Outpatient and Home Healthcare Industry is in the top 47% of all Zacks industries and the company was able to impressively beat its first-quarter expectations on Monday.With a strong business environment, DaVita stands out as a leading provider of dialysis services in the U.S. to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure.Story continuesQ1 Review: DaVita’s outlook is brightening after blasting Q1 earnings estimates by 46%. First-quarter earnings came in at $1.58 per share compared to EPS estimates of $1.08. Earnings were slightly down -2% YoY from a very tough to-compete-against prior-year quarter.Still, DaVita’s bottom-line results were stellar and the company also beat Q1 top-line estimates by 1% with sales at $2.87 billion. This was up 2% from the prior-year quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading at $95 a share, DaVita’s annual bottom line is regaining steam and stabilizing after Covid-19 greatly boosted the company’s growth throughout the pandemic.To that point, DaVita’s earnings are now forecasted to dip -1% in FY23 but rebound and jump 13% in FY24 at $7.33 per share. Plus, earnings estimate revisions have trended higher over the last week.On the top line, sales are projected to be up 1% this year and rise another 3% in FY24 to $12.09 billion. More intriguingly, sales have continued to increase over the last few years and have not curtailed as we move past the Covid-19 pandemic which flared the need for kidney treatments as these patients were at higher risk.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayBellRing and DaVita stocks are looking attractive after their strong quarterly results which was a good sign that growth and sustainability could continue. There should be more near-term upside for both stocks but more importantly, they are starting to look like viable investments for 2023 and beyond.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Addus HomeCare (ADUS) is a stock many investors are watching right now. ADUS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 19.56 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 20.68. Over the past 52 weeks, ADUS's Forward P/E has been as high as 28.16 and as low as 19.18, with a median of 24.52.Investors should also note that ADUS holds a PEG ratio of 1.66. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ADUS's industry has an average PEG of 2.98 right now. Within the past year, ADUS's PEG has been as high as 2.50 and as low as 1.64, with a median of 2.12.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is ADUS's P/B ratio of 2.07. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. ADUS's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.74. Over the past 12 months, ADUS's P/B has been as high as 2.95 and as low as 2.02, with a median of 2.58.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that ADUS has a P/CF ratio of 20.76. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 23.50. Over the past year, ADUS's P/CF has been as high as 30.54 and as low as 20.20, with a median of 26.69.Investors could also keep in mind DaVita (DVA), an Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.DaVita is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 15.73 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.87. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 20.68 and average PEG ratio of 2.98.Over the last 12 months, DVA's P/E has been as high as 15.73, as low as 7.30, with a median of 11.03, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.87, as low as 0.80, with a median of 1.22.Additionally, DaVita has a P/B ratio of 10.40 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.74. For DVA, this valuation metric has been as high as 12.74, as low as 7.06, with a median of 9.12 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Addus HomeCare and DaVita's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

These are enterprises that enjoy both analyst support and command reliable, predictable businesses. By nature, they’re boring and with perhaps only one exception, will likely not yield gargantuan returns. Nevertheless, they should help keep the lights on in your portfolio.Fundamentally, investors must at least consider the best stocks to buy before a crash if they intend to stay in the market. Worryingly, a MarketWatch op-ed warned that if you’re a student of history, the bank failures we suffered may only be the beginning. On a personal note, I’m note sure how the experts can be so calm about the situation, other than perhaps not wanting to spark a mass panic. Again, that’s not what I’m trying to do here. However, it’s probably prudent to learn how to create a crash-proof portfolio, particularly with safe stocks for long-term investors.

I can’t think of a better enterprise in that regard than Waste Management (NYSE:WM). As many observers point out, we live in a consumer-driven economy. Therefore, we’re constantly buying stuff and getting rid of it. Unfortunately, matter just doesn’t disappear, which is where Waste Management comes in.Financially, the company benefits from a predictable business profile, to no one’s surprise. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 9.5%, above 63.45% of sector players. On the bottom line, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 11.33%, outflanking 72.22% of the field. As well, Waste Management is an extremely high-quality enterprise, as determined by its lofty return on equity (ROE) of 32.27%.Story continuesFinally, analysts peg WM as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as five buys and six holds. Overall, the experts’ price target lands at $172.40, implying nearly 3% upside potential. Thanks to its critical business, WM makes a case for crash-proof stocks to buy.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockA consumer goods giant, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) easily ranks among the best stocks to buy before a crash. Obviously, investors received a harsh lesson of its relevancy during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even with the mysterious SARS-CoV-2 virus floating around seemingly ready to strike, people hounded grocery stores and similar retailers in the hunt for toilet paper. Put another way, people will buy the essentials, come hell or high water.Financially, Procter &amp; Gamble doesn’t offer the most remarkable of financial profiles. But the important point is that it gets the job done. Notably, the company benefits from a decent balance sheet, particularly its Altman Z-Score of 5.36. This indicates high fiscal stability and low bankruptcy risk.On the bottom line, P&amp;G really comes alive. Its trailing-year net margin comes in at 17.69%, ranked better than 91.66% of the field. Also, its ROE prints an incredibly robust 31.72%. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $165.82, implying nearly 7% upside potential.

First, Sempra benefits from a natural monopoly.

Sure, you hear a bunch of partisan chatter about the Golden State being incredibly expensive, forcing to migrate out. But so many people are moving in, which makes Sempra a gold mine among safe stocks for long-term investors. Financially, Sempra doesn’t offer a remarkable profile, much like other utilities. However, it enjoys a robust net margin and consistent profitability. To close out, analysts peg SRE a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $169.67, implying almost 11% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA chain of specialty discount stores, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is a step above in terms of that categorization. Rather than focusing exclusively on products that sell for a buck or less, most of its inventory sell for less than $5, hence the name. Also, Five Below features a small assortment of products from $6 to $25, offering a bargain hunt for all shoppers. It’s a compelling example of crash-proof stocks.Financially, the company prints excellent growth stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.8%, above 81.67% of sector rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 18.6%, above 66.78%. On the bottom line, Five Below’s net margin impresses at 8.5%, outflanking 81.39% of its peers. Notably, it enjoys a high-quality business with an ROE of 22%. Therefore, it could be one of the top stocks to survive a market crash, both for its fiscal performance and for its relevancy.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg FIVE a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $224.63, implying almost 16% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For investors seeking crash-proof stocks, you don’t need to look much further than Progressive (NYSE:PGR). Obviously, insurance companies like Progressive present an incredibly boring profile. However, boring is good during times of uncertainty. Plus, the sector stalwart – known mostly for its auto insurance policies – benefits from a captive audience.Basically, almost every state in the Union requires drivers to hold auto insurance. Plus, whether mandated or not, having insurance just makes good logical sense, particularly in the post-pandemic environment. To be sure, prospective investors should note that PGR lost about 3% since the January opener. Unfortunately, it incurred recent volatility. Nevertheless, the core relevancy of its business should help PGR gradually rise higher.Another factor to consider is that its financials don’t exactly stand out. However, the company posts solid revenue growth and consistent profitability. Looking to the Street, analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $147.07, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Home Depot (HD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIf you want some pointers about the best stocks to buy before a crash, former Home Depot (NYSE:HD) CEO Bob Nardelli issued a grim warning regarding the “very complex” economy we have. Specifically, he warned that bankruptcies may continue accelerating or continue shrinking their physical footprint. While that might impact Home Depot as well, I believe the company stands a bit above the rest.Fundamentally, we’re not just dealing with a discretionary retailer but also an enterprise that delivers valuable services. I’ve mentioned this before but back during the Covid-19 crisis, Home Depot kept its doors open for longer than other retailers to help folks get through the calamity. The company also acts as a critical goods supplier during periods of natural disasters.Financially, Home Depot commands a solid top line with a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.2%. This stat ranks above 78.79% of other retailers. Also, its net margin comes in at 10.87%, above 87% of the field. Lastly, analysts peg HD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $337.78, implying over 18% upside potential.CVS Health (CVS)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA healthcare company best known for its retail pharmacy chain, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) could make a case for crash-proof stocks because it represents a necessity. From prescription drugs to over-the-counter meds, CVS provides to everyone’s health-related needs. And since demand remains consistent and largely predictable, the company enjoys cynical upside.However, CVS stock has been incredibly volatile this year. Although the underlying enterprise beat first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, management lowered its guidance for the full year. Naturally, investors didn’t care for that too much. Since the January opener, CVS slipped 26%.Nevertheless, for the intrepid contrarian, the company may be undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.69. As a discount to projected earnings, CVS ranks better than 88.89% of the competition. On a final note, analysts peg CVS as a consensus strong buy. On average, the experts’ price target comes in at $102.60, implying over 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

304,96c4af0a-a467-3e99-b631-18df0daf329b,VMC,2023-05-12,7 Construction Stocks to Bet On as Biden Builds 2024 Campaign,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-construction-stocks-bet-biden-171217545.html,1683479537,STORY,"['VMC', 'URI', 'MLM', 'MAS', 'CAT', 'KELYB', 'DE']","[With President Joe Biden officially announcing his re-election bid recently, investors should start considering the best construction stocks to buy now. Let’s be real: Biden doesn’t have the greatest approval rating. And he’s old – astonishingly old. Nevertheless, he does have a solid chance of winning the White House again. And that bodes well for the blue-collar sector because of Biden and construction industry dynamics.Obviously, Biden initially ran on the campaign promise to build back better. And he helped make good on that promise via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. With a second term, Biden may bring some predictability to the political order. Further, reports about the construction industry analysis in 2023 point toward the pursuit of growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. There’s a better chance of that happening if Biden wins.Still, how can anyone be so confident about his reelection? As The Guardian pointed out, the Republicans are internally divided. You have small-government Republicans (remember those guys?), Trump hardliners and the “Fringe” (it’s better I don’t explain). For the Democrats, you only have President Biden and “Dark Brandon.” It’s just a more cogent framework. Here are the top construction companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMLMMartin Marietta Materials$397.66MASMasco$53.45VMCVulcan Materials$193.57CATCaterpillar$215.09DEDeere$381.09URIUnited Rentals$342.05KELYAKelly Services$16.24Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) is a supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, with operations spanning 26 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. Notably, Martin Marietta supplies resources for the construction of roads, sidewalks, and foundations. Presently, it features a market capitalization of $24.65 billion. Since the start of the year, MLM gained an impressive 15%, making it one of the best construction stocks to buy now.Story continuesOn the financials, Martin Marietta benefits from solid operational statistics. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.3%, above 68.87% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period pings at 12.4%, above 64.09% of sector rivals. On the bottom line, the company posts a trailing-year net margin of 14.07%, outflanking 82.64% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg MLM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $418.50, implying almost 8% upside potential.Masco (MAS)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAn American manufacturer of products for the home improvement and new home construction markets, Masco (NYSE:MAS) is a bit of a risk when compared to other top construction companies to invest in. Largely, MAS depends on sentiment for renovation and real estate acquisition. That’s questionable given rising layoffs and interest rates. Nevertheless, for contrarians, MAS could rank among the best construction stocks to buy now.Indeed, the market carries optimism, with shares bouncing over 11% since the Jan. opener. Operationally, Masco enjoys encouraging stats. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 17.1%, ranked above 84.26% of other construction stocks. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period lands at 13.4%, above 67.44%. On the bottom line, Masco prints an excellent trailing-year net margin of 9.67%, beating out 82.91% of the competition. As with Martin Marietta, Masco benefits from consistent profitability.Lastly, covering analysts peg MAS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $57.92, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Vulcan Materials (VMC)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHailing from Birmingham, Alabama, Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates— primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel — and a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, according to its website. Because of the Biden and construction industry relationship, VMC popped up 8% since the beginning of this year.Investors may look forward to additional gains as VMC ranks among the best construction stocks to buy now. Primarily, Vulcan enjoys strong sales performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above 80.44% of its rivals. On the bottom line, Vulcan features an operating margin and net margin of 13.79% and 7.87%, respectively. Both stats rank above at least 65% of sector peers.To close out, analysts peg VMC as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 10 buys, two holds and zero sells. Overall, the experts’ average price target is $209, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Caterpillar (CAT)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA world-famous construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is no stranger to lists targeting the best construction stocks to buy now. However, it’s interesting at this juncture because of the Biden and construction industry dynamics. In the runup to the 2016 presidential election, former President Donald Trump often praised Caterpillar. However, CAT represents a contrarian play, with shares down 12% since the January opener.To be fair, many of its fiscal stats sit as rather ho-hum: not bad, not great. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 5.7%, better than 54% of its peers. That’s nice but nothing earth-shattering. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the aforementioned period is 9.2%, better than 50.43% of sector players. Again, nothing remarkable.However, Caterpillar offers business predictability. Its operating margin and net margin ping at 15.73% and 11.53%, ranking better than at least 87% of other construction stocks. Currently, analysts peg CAT as a hold. On average, the experts anticipate shares hitting $239.07, implying growth potential of almost 14%.Deere (DE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Specializing in the manufacture of agricultural machinery, Deere (NYSE:DE) is a key player in heavy equipment, forestry machinery, diesel engines, drivetrains used in heavy equipment, and lawn care equipment. Given the Democrats’ holistic view of infrastructure, the need to boost food-related supply chains should undergird this special category of the best construction stocks to buy now. Since the start of the year, DE lost 12% of its equity value.However, such red ink seems rather unreasonable given the broader fiscal picture. Operationally, Deere’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 11.7%, beating out nearly 72% of its peers. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 18.6%, above 72.46%. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin lands at 14.9%, ranked better than 92% of sector players. Also, it enjoys consistent profitability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $470.15, implying nearly 26% upside potential.United Rentals (URI)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBilled as the world’s largest equipment rental company, United Rentals (NYSE:URI) owns approximately 4,700 classes of equipment. In addition, United offers a combined total of over 1,400 locations covering North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Should President Biden win reelection, construction demand might soar, boding well for equipment providers.Enticingly, the market prices URI at a forward multiple of 7.93. As a discount to projected earnings, United ranks better than 82.78% of the competition. Also, URI trades at 4.86 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 10.91 times. Operationally, United posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.9%, ranked better than 71.89% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the aforementioned period is 25.5%, outpacing nearly 85% of the field.Looking to the Street, analysts peg URI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $421.83, implying over 28% upside potential. Though it’s a higher risk, it makes a solid case for the best construction stocks to buy now.Kelly Services (KELYA)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAn office staffing company featuring global operations, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might not immediately figure as one of the top construction companies to invest in. However, Kelly provides staffing solutions for myriad industries, including the construction sector. And frankly, building back better doesn’t mean much if companies don’t have anyone to do so.To be fair, KELYA represents one of the higher-risk stories among construction stocks, with shares down 7% year-to-date. Still, it could attract speculators because of its value proposition. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 9.99. As a discount to projected earnings, Kelly ranks better than 72.19% of the competition. Also, KELYA trades at 0.63 times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median is a lofty 2.14 times.On the balance sheet, Kelly enjoys a cash-to-debt ratio of 2.18, above 61.56% of its peers. However, it had some troubles regarding negative sales growth and net margin. Nevertheless, an improved construction sector outlook could do wonders for the enterprise. On a final note, analysts peg KELYA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $24, implying over 52% growth potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These are enterprises that enjoy both analyst support and command reliable, predictable businesses. By nature, they’re boring and with perhaps only one exception, will likely not yield gargantuan returns. Nevertheless, they should help keep the lights on in your portfolio.Fundamentally, investors must at least consider the best stocks to buy before a crash if they intend to stay in the market. Worryingly, a MarketWatch op-ed warned that if you’re a student of history, the bank failures we suffered may only be the beginning. On a personal note, I’m note sure how the experts can be so calm about the situation, other than perhaps not wanting to spark a mass panic. Again, that’s not what I’m trying to do here. However, it’s probably prudent to learn how to create a crash-proof portfolio, particularly with safe stocks for long-term investors.

I can’t think of a better enterprise in that regard than Waste Management (NYSE:WM). As many observers point out, we live in a consumer-driven economy. Therefore, we’re constantly buying stuff and getting rid of it. Unfortunately, matter just doesn’t disappear, which is where Waste Management comes in.Financially, the company benefits from a predictable business profile, to no one’s surprise. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 9.5%, above 63.45% of sector players. On the bottom line, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 11.33%, outflanking 72.22% of the field. As well, Waste Management is an extremely high-quality enterprise, as determined by its lofty return on equity (ROE) of 32.27%.Story continuesFinally, analysts peg WM as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as five buys and six holds. Overall, the experts’ price target lands at $172.40, implying nearly 3% upside potential. Thanks to its critical business, WM makes a case for crash-proof stocks to buy.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockA consumer goods giant, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) easily ranks among the best stocks to buy before a crash. Obviously, investors received a harsh lesson of its relevancy during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even with the mysterious SARS-CoV-2 virus floating around seemingly ready to strike, people hounded grocery stores and similar retailers in the hunt for toilet paper. Put another way, people will buy the essentials, come hell or high water.Financially, Procter &amp; Gamble doesn’t offer the most remarkable of financial profiles. But the important point is that it gets the job done. Notably, the company benefits from a decent balance sheet, particularly its Altman Z-Score of 5.36. This indicates high fiscal stability and low bankruptcy risk.On the bottom line, P&amp;G really comes alive. Its trailing-year net margin comes in at 17.69%, ranked better than 91.66% of the field. Also, its ROE prints an incredibly robust 31.72%. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $165.82, implying nearly 7% upside potential. It may be boring but it’s also one of the crash-proof stocks.Sempra Energy (SRE)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOne of the top utility companies in the nation, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) makes a viable case for cash-proof stocks for two key reasons. First, Sempra benefits from a natural monopoly.

Sure, you hear a bunch of partisan chatter about the Golden State being incredibly expensive, forcing to migrate out. But so many people are moving in, which makes Sempra a gold mine among safe stocks for long-term investors. Financially, Sempra doesn’t offer a remarkable profile, much like other utilities.

However, the company posts solid revenue growth and consistent profitability. Looking to the Street, analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $147.07, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Home Depot (HD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIf you want some pointers about the best stocks to buy before a crash, former Home Depot (NYSE:HD) CEO Bob Nardelli issued a grim warning regarding the “very complex” economy we have. Specifically, he warned that bankruptcies may continue accelerating or continue shrinking their physical footprint. While that might impact Home Depot as well, I believe the company stands a bit above the rest.Fundamentally, we’re not just dealing with a discretionary retailer but also an enterprise that delivers valuable services. I’ve mentioned this before but back during the Covid-19 crisis, Home Depot kept its doors open for longer than other retailers to help folks get through the calamity. The company also acts as a critical goods supplier during periods of natural disasters.Financially, Home Depot commands a solid top line with a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.2%. This stat ranks above 78.79% of other retailers. Also, its net margin comes in at 10.87%, above 87% of the field. Lastly, analysts peg HD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $337.78, implying over 18% upside potential.CVS Health (CVS)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA healthcare company best known for its retail pharmacy chain, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) could make a case for crash-proof stocks because it represents a necessity. From prescription drugs to over-the-counter meds, CVS provides to everyone’s health-related needs. And since demand remains consistent and largely predictable, the company enjoys cynical upside.However, CVS stock has been incredibly volatile this year. Although the underlying enterprise beat first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, management lowered its guidance for the full year. Naturally, investors didn’t care for that too much. Since the January opener, CVS slipped 26%.Nevertheless, for the intrepid contrarian, the company may be undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.69. As a discount to projected earnings, CVS ranks better than 88.89% of the competition. On a final note, analysts peg CVS as a consensus strong buy. On average, the experts’ price target comes in at $102.60, implying over 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

312,6c823340-3c53-3d89-997a-9c1aa4206990,LKQ,2023-05-12,"LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lkq-corporation-nasdaq-lkq-looks-101155423.html,1683886315,STORY,['LKQ'],"[It looks like LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase LKQ's shares before the 17th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 1st of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.28 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.10 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that LKQ has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current share price of $56.64. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether LKQ has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for LKQ Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately LKQ's payout ratio is modest, at just 25% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 35% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that LKQ's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see LKQ's earnings per share have risen 20% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.Given that LKQ has only been paying a dividend for a year, there's not much of a past history to draw insight from.Final TakeawayShould investors buy LKQ for the upcoming dividend?

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.Billionaire Warren Buffett has time and again proved that he is truly peerless when it comes to investing. His simple style and relentless repetition of age-old, tried and tested and sometimes cliché investing principles make it all look easy. And it seems Buffett’s true genius shines when things are going south for the broader markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that Berkshire also outperforms during recessions and bears markets. The firm says that Berkshire shares have beaten the market for no less than six recessions since 1980 by a median of 4.41 percentage points.During the same time period, Berkshire Hathaway, which is up about 4.5% year to date through May 10, surpassed S&amp;P 500 each time it dropped 20%, beating the broader index by a median of 14.89 percentage points.There are many lessons that could be drawn from decades of jaw-dropping outperformance of the Oracle of Omaha. But the most important and relevant of these is Buffett’s focus on dividends.$5.7 Billion in Cash in a Single YearAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, which cites an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is expected to generate $5.7 billion in cash from its stock portfolio in 2023. Most of this would be coming from dividends. The WSJ report said that a major chunk of this cash would come from some famous dividend stocks that Buffett has huge stakes in.About $1.1 billion would be coming from Chevron, in which Buffett has a huge stake (more on that later in the article). The WSJ report also mentioned that Buffett would collect $700 million each from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while the Oracle of Omaha will collect about $500 million from Kraft Heinz. From American Express, the billionaire’s check would give him about $363 million.Story continuesAll of this looks very simple at the surface. Just find famous dividend companies, invest in them and collect your payments, right? But if it were that simple Warren Buffett would lose his charm and charisma and the world won’t line up to listen to his advice.Buffett's Secret Sauce: ""The Weeds Wither Away in Significance as the Flowers Bloom""In a letter penned last year, Warren Buffett told about his “secret” of success in dividend investing under a heading “The Secret Sauce.” Buffett’s words sum up decades of wisdom and his foresight.Here’s what he said:""In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""There are several other dividend stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in addition to the famous dividend-paying companies we mentioned above. In this article we are going to take a look at all of the important dividend-paying companies in Buffett's portfolio. Dividend payments from these companies would help the legendary investor get $5.7 billion in cash this year.Warren Buffett's Top Dividend PicksOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Berkshire’s 13F portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top dividend-paying companies in which the fund had stakes.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.47, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.47 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.8% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying P&amp;G, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PG Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $5.86.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

317,6ad54abc-866d-37d8-8f3b-cb5d6897912b,PG,2023-05-12,Investors Heavily Search Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-procter-gamble-130001286.html,1683810001,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has gained 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of +9.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.86 points to a change of +0.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.34 indicates a change of +8.2% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $81.38 billion and $85.02 billion estimates indicate +1.5% and +4.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.01%. The EPS surprise was +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Further, Alphabet's expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.Alphabet's growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives.

319,b532c35f-2a73-3b31-8323-ba995f4b243f,PG,2023-05-12,Here's Why You Should Invest in Clorox (CLX) Right Away,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-invest-clorox-clx-125812468.html,1683809892,STORY,"['CLX', 'CHD', 'PG']","[The Clorox Company CLX has been favored by investors on the back of solid demand, cost-saving efforts, strong execution and pricing actions. Its IGNITE strategy and digital investments bode well.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. The consensus estimate for the current financial year has increased 2.3% to $4.44 over the past seven days. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5% and  Growth Score of B highlights its inherent strength.Let’s Delve DeeperClorox has been gaining from a solid innovation pipeline, digital transformation, pricing and cost-saving efforts. It has been on track with its streamlined operating model, which aims to improve efficiency. This led to the impressive third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter.Adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share improved 15% year over year and surpassed our estimate of $1.20. Earnings benefited from pricing gains and cost savings, negated by increased advertising investments, higher selling and administrative expenses, and a rise in commodity costs. Net sales of $1,915 million rose 6% from the year-ago quarter and exceeded our estimate of $1,804.5 million. On an organic basis, sales improved 8%. Sales growth was attributed to a favorable price mix, partly offset by lower volume. The company witnessed organic sales growth in all four segments, driven by improved service levels.CLX is on track with the IGNITE strategy, which focuses on the expansion of the key elements under the 2020 Strategy to pace up innovation in each area of business. The IGNITE strategy encompasses the long-term financial targets of achieving net sales growth of 3-5%, an EBIT margin expansion of 25-50 bps and a free cash flow generation of 11-13% of sales.Management announced a streamlined operating model to create a faster, simpler company through the Reimagine Work under its IGNITE strategy. The operating model implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 will help increase efficiencies and transform the company's operations in the areas of the supply chain, digital commerce, innovation, brand building and more over the long term.The implementation of this new model is likely to be completed in fiscal 2024. The company expected the operating model to generate ongoing annual savings of $75-$100 million, with benefits likely to occur from fiscal 2023. Of this, the company expected $40-60 million or 30 cents per share to be recognized in fiscal 2023 under other income and expenses.The company has been witnessing strong progress in the core International business as it continues to build on the success of the segment's Go Lean strategy. These efforts will help accelerate profitable growth for the segment. Driven by its IGNITE Strategy, which aims to improve profitability in International business, the company expects to invest selectively in profitable platforms.CLX has been exploring international opportunities, including the acquisition of a majority stake in its joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The company believes that the acquisition will boost long-term growth in the international segment. In third-quarter fiscal 2023, organic sales for the International segment improved 1%, whereas organic sales for the segment improved 14%.Driven by these factors, it envisions 2023 year-over-year net sales growth of 1-2% compared with the prior mentioned 2% decline to 1% growth. Organic sales are anticipated to increase 3-4% versus flat to up 3% mentioned earlier. The company expects adjusted earnings of $4.35-$4.50 per share for fiscal 2023 compared with the $4.05-$4.30 stated earlier. The guidance suggests a year-over-year increase of 6-10%. The gross margin is expected to increase 250-300 bps in fiscal 2023 compared with the prior mentioned 200 bps, driven by the combined benefits of pricing actions, cost-saving and supply-chain-optimization efforts, offset by continued cost inflation.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have gained 10.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 9%.Other Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Procter &amp; Gamble PG, Conagra Brands CAG and Church &amp; Dwight Co.

While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.The upward trend in estimate revisions for this world's largest airline reflects growing optimism of analysts on its earnings prospects, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 26.43%.Current-Year Estimate RevisionsThe company is expected to earn $2.77 per share for the full year, which represents a change of +454% from the prior-year number.There has been an encouraging trend in estimate revisions for the current year as well. Over the past month, seven estimates have moved up for American Airlines versus one negative revision. This has pushed the consensus estimate 14.27% higher.Favorable Zacks RankThanks to promising estimate revisions, American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

That said, income-oriented investing cannot exclude this group, as the yields and payouts are simply too attractive.The stock market is in a tough spot. On the one hand, we’ve had a hot start to 2023, but it’s only being led by a handful of stocks. On the other hand, we’re not necessarily out of the woods. Rates continue to rise and there’s finally some economic risk (both from the regional banks and from the economy).That leaves REITs (and the stock market) in a tough place. Additionally, commercial real estate is facing a serious risk, as office space supply remains way too high. This is causing stress in the commercial real estate space — something that’s garnered attention but continues to get ignored by the overall market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHow will that impact the  best REIT stocks to buy now? Honestly, I don’t know. But I do know that there are a handful of REITs that have been consistent with their payouts and will be consistent through whatever mess we face in the next 12 to possibly 24 months.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockKnown as The Monthly Dividend Company, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is a fan favorite in the REIT community.  And why shouldn’t it be? The stock currently pays out a dividend yield of a little under 5% and it pays out its distribution monthly instead of quarterly. Even better, the company has raised its dividend for 102 consecutive quarters (more than 25 years) and has paid its monthly dividend consecutively for more than 52 years!That’s a really impressive feat, while management has worked hard to build a strong and diverse group of tenants in markets that have generated consistency.One knock? The stock suffered a peak-to-trough decline of about 47% during the Covid-19 selloff. Not only did that lag the major US indices, but the stock never went on to take out those highs while many stocks did take out their pre-Covid highs.Story continuesRegardless, long-term shareholders should be rewarded by this firm as its consistency is hard to beat.Federal Realty (FRT)Real estate agent handing over a house key, desktop with tools, wood swatches and computer on background, top view. Real estate stocks.Source: Stock-Asso / ShutterstockAnother name that consistently finds itself in the discussion of the best REIT stocks to buy? How about Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT).The company pays out a 4.5% dividend yield and, for the longest time, finding any yield in this name over 4% was nearly impossible. In fact, a number of years went by where finding a yield above 3% was a tough ask!Despite its relatively modest market capitalization of $7.85 billion, this firm has been around paying dividends for a long time. According to the company, “With over half a century of dividend increases year after year, we hold the single longest annual dividend growth record among all REITs.”The company points out that the streak includes raising the dividend through oil embargos, periods of high inflation, a financial crisis and several recessions. It has now raised its dividend in 55 consecutive years.Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comI don’t know about you, but there was a time in my life where I needed to temporarily store some items that simply would not fit at my home. Thinking this would be an easy task to solve, I went online, found a storage unit company and gave them a call. No space. So I called another, and another, and another…You get the idea. That’s when it really dawned on me what a great operation the storage unit business has become. That’s why I like Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR). The stock pays a 4.19% dividend yield and while it’s not as impressive as O or FRT, it has raised its dividend in 13 straight years.When the company recently reported earnings, its funds from operations (or FFO) slightly missed consensus expectations, while revenue grew more than 13% year-to-year to just over $500 million.Going forward, Extra Space Storage should continue to have impressive growth. The company is the second-largest self-storage operator in the US and “in the last 5 years, we added 4.6 billion dollars in new acquisitions to our national portfolio.”On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on PepsiCo is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$12b ÷ (US$93b - US$26b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 18%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 15% generated by the Beverage industry. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PepsiCo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 20% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.The Key TakeawayTo sum it up, PepsiCo has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 131% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesOne more thing: We've identified   5 warning signs  with PepsiCo (at least 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.While PepsiCo isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

324,1b434a06-7124-37a9-aed3-656989b8fd8c,UNP,2023-05-12,Shake Shack and Community Bancshares have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shake-shack-community-bancshares-highlighted-114811158.html,1683805691,STORY,"['SHAK', 'NSC', 'UNP', 'DCOM']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Shake Shack SHAK as the Bull of the Day and Community Bancshares DCOM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Union Pacific Corp. UNP and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Shake Shack, the fast-food hamburger and milkshake chain is on a tear this year, and it looks like the bull run may have just begun. Shake Shack boasts a compelling trade setup with top a Zacks Ranks, convincing technical chart patterns, and improving business fundamentals.SHAK currently scores a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. It has also benefited from the recent strength of the Retail – Restaurant industry, which is currently in the top 18% of the Zacks Industry Rank, outperforming the broad market YTD.Company DescriptionShake Shack serves elevated versions of American classic foods, with high quality ingredients. It is primarily known for its burgers, chicken sandwiches, hand-spun milkshakes, and house-made lemonade. The first Shake Shack location opened in 2004 in New York City and has grown to approximately 460 locations today.The company operates 436 restaurants, including 254 domestic company-operated locations and 33 domestic-licensed locations. Additionally, there are 149 international-licensed restaurants. SHAK also operates an impressive mobile app through which diners can order meals before arriving at the restaurant.Q1 EarningsLast week, Shake Shack reported Q1 earnings, and results came in better than expected. Earnings for the quarter were -$0.01 per share, beating estimates of -$0.09 per share. Sales for the quarter came in at $253 million, up 24.5% YoY and beating analysts' estimates of $246 million.SHAK was also able to improve several key business metrics. Same store sales were up 10.3%, led by higher menu prices and double-digit traffic growth. This increase brings average weekly sales to $73,000. Additionally, operating margins have increased 310 basis points in the last year, bringing them up to 18.3%.Story continuesThe company opened six new domestic, company-operated locations and seven new licensed restaurants including locations in Mexico and China.Investors were clearly happy with the earnings beat as shares rallied tremendously following the report. Shares are up 20% following the earnings report, and SHAK stock is now up 60% YTD.Shake Shack has grown at an impressive pace over the past decade. Sales have climbed nearly 10x from just $110 million in 2014 to over $950 million today.Technical SetupShake Shack stock just broke out of an extremely compelling chart pattern. After drawing in investors, and building out a year long base, SHAK has broken out of a bull flag consolidation.Although the technical setup has already been completed, the close at the top of the range, followed by another weekly gap up is a bullish signal. From a technical perspective SHAK is a convincing investment, and any pullbacks are good buying opportunities.ValuationShake Shack is trading at a trailing twelve-month Price to EBITDA ratio of 34x, which is below its five-year median of 35x, and well above the industry average 15x. It should be noted that SHAK has traded at a significant premium to the industry for the entirety of its time as a public company.When compared directly to a competitor of a similar caliber SHAK's valuation makes more sense. Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, which is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has a very comparable valuation. Trading at 34x TTM Price to EBITDA, CMG is right in line with SHAK. Both provide innovative, high-quality offerings and are some of the fastest growing companies in their respective sectors.Bottom LineShake Shack has a lot going for it today. With improving business economics, growing same-store sales, increased traffic, improving earnings estimates, and strong technical momentum SHAK is a worthy consideration for any investor's portfolio.Bear of the Day:It is no secret that the regional banking sector is under considerable pressure, and Dime Community Bancshares has not been excluded. DCOM is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, indicating downward trending earnings revisions. DCOM also has some unfavorable banking metrics I want to draw attention to.Dime Community Bancshares Inc. is the holding company for Dime Community Bank. It provides deposit and loan products and financial services to local businesses, consumers, and municipalities.DCOM stock is being sold aggressively, considerably underperforming the sector and halving in value over the last five years.Earnings ResultsDime Community Bancshares experienced some brief solace following its earnings results at the end of April, however that strength was only an opportunity for more selling. DCOM managed to beat earnings estimates, but it wasn't enough to stop the selling.Earnings of $0.92 per share beat Zacks Estimates of $0.82 per share. However, sales of $94.75 million missed estimates of $99 million. It is worth noting that because of the environment, DCOM estimates had been revised considerably lower leading up to the report. So, while earnings beat estimates, they were a much lower target, and sales couldn't reach even the lower expectations.Future earnings expectations haven't improved either. Analysts are in unanimous agreement in downgrading DCOM across timeframes. Q2 earnings have been downgraded by -30% over just the last 60 days. Huge revisions lower in estimates are exactly what bears want to see.ConcernsThe Q1 earnings report also showed some concerning data regarding deposits. As much as 30% of DCOM's bank deposits were non-insured, leaving it potentially vulnerable in the case of a run on the bank. Deposits did increase from $10.25 billion to $10.57 billion in the quarter though, which is very reassuring.There was an additional balance sheet metric that caught my attention. A line labeled ""accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI),"" shows a -$98 million loss.One of the major pieces of data that initially caused concern regarding Silicon Valley Bank before its downfall was unrealized losses on securities. SIVB was holding a ton of long-dated Treasuries on its balance sheet, and when interest rates rose in 2022, the value of those securities dropped. SIVB reported a loss of -$1.8 billion because of this, which led them to try and raise capital through a share offering. It was never completed.Unrealized losses on securities are included in that AOCI figure, meaning DCOM is holding securities that are underwater. I want to make this extremely clear, SIVB didn't fail because of its unrealized losses, and neither will Dime Bancshares, but it was and is a concerning figure.As it currently stands, AOCI as a percentage of total stockholders' equity is -8.2%. When Silicon Valley Bank went under that number was -11.7%. Again, this isn't an alarm that should cause the stock to crash, but a red flag.ValuationDime Community Bancshares is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6x, which is below the industry average 8x, and below its four-year median of 9.5x. The tremendous fall in share price is what has caused the valuation to fall so precipitously from last year.During the most recent quarterly report management announced that they were raising the dividend payment from $0.24 per quarter to $0.25, which they believe reflects a strong financial position. DCOM has an annual dividend yield of 5.9%.Bottom LineDCOM is in a very challenging position. Not only is it caught up in one of the worst national bank scares since the Savings and Loan Crisis, but it also displays some concerning financial metrics to back those fears. Fortunately for them, the deposit base remains at the bank quelling the worst fears, but analysts are still bearish. While there is no evidence DCOM should suffer the same fate as SIVB, it is likely to continue to see downward pressure, and should thus be avoided.Additional content:2 Dividend-Paying Railroad Stocks You Can Count OnThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry continues to suffer from headwinds like raging inflation, higher interest rates, increased fuel price and supply-chain disruptions. Even though oil price has declined (down 5.7% in the January-March period) due to recession fears, it remains high. Since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, an uptick in fuel costs is not a welcome development. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 3.9% over the past six months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index's 4% appreciation and 0.7% decline of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Union Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $121.90 billion.UNP pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.30 ($5.20 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.60% yield at the current stock price. This company's payout ratio is 45% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.02%. (Check Union Pacific's dividend history here).We are impressed with Union Pacific's consistent efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company hiked its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP's board of directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.30 per share. Notably, Union Pacific has been paying dividends on its common stock for 123 consecutive years.During first-quarter 2023, UNP paid dividends worth $795 million and repurchased shares worth $575 million. In 2022, UNP paid dividends worth $3,159 million and repurchased shares worth $6,282 million. For 2023, management continues to anticipate a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings).Norfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $47.14 billion.NSC pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.35 ($5.40 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.61% yield at the current stock price. This company's payout ratio is 38% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 11.95%. (Check Norfolk Southern's dividend history here).We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In January 2023, the company's board announced a dividend hike of 9%, thereby raising its quarterly dividend payout from $1.24 per share to $1.35. During first-quarter 2023, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $307 million and repurchased and retired 0.6 million shares for $163 million.During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million. In 2021, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,028 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,390 million. Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company's commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors' confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

325,8e2b5d3b-1e16-3ed3-887b-35344b69125b,UNP,2023-05-12,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at an All-Time Low in May,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-buy-113041452.html,1683545441,STORY,"['VZ', 'GLW', 'EXR', 'UNP', 'CF', 'CHK']","[Now is an excellent time to research the top blue-chip stocks to buy for the long haul.It’s safe to say that investors are stuck in a market that shows little conviction. This is frustrating for bulls and bears. One problem is valuation. Many stocks still are trading at a premium to the market. This includes some blue-chip stocks. Some, but not all. And that’s where there’s an opportunity for investors who have the patience to look for the top blue-chip stocks to buy. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-chip stocks have a better chance of revenue and earnings growth. The latter is the mother’s milk of stock price growth.In order to find the best blue-chip stocks to buy now, I used a stock screener to find large-cap stocks that paid a dividend with a yield of over 2% and was trading within 10% of its 52-week low.The list gave me a diverse list of companies and I’ve picked what may be the top seven picks for investors looking for a place to get keep their portfolio growing in a market beset by stagflation.GLWCorning$31.48VZVerizon Communications$37.83WYWeyerhauser$29.67EXRExtra Space Storage$154.74CHKChesapeake Energy$78.64CFCF Industries$69.64UNPUnion Pacific$201.23Corning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comCorning (NYSE:GLW) sells its products through several channels. Its products have applications in many markets. This makes the company less affected by weakness in any one sector. Plus, an overview of Corning’s financials shows it distributes its revenue, which was about $14 billion in 2022, relatively evenly across all of its channels. That means investors can count on Corning to deliver consistent revenue and rising earnings. This can offset the fact that at 29x earnings, investors are paying a premium for GLW stock.  Analysts project earnings growth of 20.5% which should help fuel the projected 20% upside for GLW stock. The earnings growth should also be enough to support the company’s dividend. Corning currently offers an attractive 3.5% yield and has been increasing its dividend for the last 13 years.  Story continuesVerizon (VZ) Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is becoming an increasingly polarizing stock. Some investors point out, perhaps correctly, that the company operates in a very competitive business where there’s little to differentiate one company from another aside from price. And that will likely eat into earnings.  The company continues to have a juicy dividend that currently yields 6.98%. Verizon has increased its dividend in each of the last 18 years. Analysts are projecting earnings growth of 0.21% this year. That’s not spectacular, but it’s “enough” growth to continue increasing the dividend. With that in mind, Verizon is a compelling stock for income-oriented investors. Analysts are forecasting a 25.3% upside in VZ stock in the next 12 months. The dividend and potential stock price growth may not be enough to attract you. But the icing on the cake may be that Verizon trades at just 7.28x earnings which makes it very undervalued to the market.  Weyerhauser (WY) Weyergaeuser logo on a smartphone with a keyboard in the background.Source: rafapress / ShutterstockWeyerhauser (NYSE:WY) is a conglomerate in the forest products industry. This is a cyclical industry, but as Chris Lau analyzed for InvestorPlace in January, the cycle is likely to work in Weyerhauser’s favor. Customers will need to replenish inventory. And they are likely to ensure they have enough lumber on hand with the trucking and logging industries still not firing on all cylinders.  Weyerhauser’s first quarter earnings report suggests that expectation is on target. The company posted earnings per share (EPS) of 21 cents per share which was far above the 12 cents per share expected. Revenue also beat expectations, coming in at $1.90 billion which was larger than the $1.86 billion expected.  That may explain why analysts are forecasting 45.78% earnings growth in 2023. And that also supports expectations for 27.8% share price growth for WY stock. Weyerhauser has a dividend yield of 2.63% and has a P/E ratio of around 16x earnings.  Extra Space Storage (EXR) Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) is a real estate investment trust.Investors have to be selective with REITs at the moment, but Extra Space Storage looks like a sound bet. One of the company’s core businesses is in the public storage space. Revenue for self-storage units tends to be sticky as consumers will always need a place to store their stuff. The company agreed to purchase LifeStorage in April. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. That may keep some pressure on the company’s earnings. That may be why analysts are projecting “only” 5% earnings growth this year. After the merger is complete the combined companies will make Extra Space Storage “the targest storage operation in the country with over 3,500 locations, over 264 million square feet and serving over two million customers.” Still, when investors are keenly interested in earnings, EXR stock looks like a good buy. It’s trading at around 23x earnings which is in line with the broader market. It also comes with an attractive dividend that currently has a 4.29% yield and has been increasing for 14 consecutive years.  Chesapeake Energy (CHK) Image of an internet browser with Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) homepage on it. The Chesapeake Energy logo on the page is amplified by a magnifying glass.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comFor the next stock on my list of top blue-chip stocks to buy I’m looking at the energy sector. Specifically, a very undervalued Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) which is trading at just 2.4x earnings.  Falling crude oil prices have been making oil stocks look attractive once again. You know about the big oil names that have been generating large profits and issuing share buybacks and generous dividends to its shareholders.  But if you’re looking for a real value in the sector, you may want to look at CHK stock. As many investors remember, the company came out of bankruptcy in 2021. Since then, investors have been rewarded with an 85% return not including the company’s dividend. The company had a blowout year in 2022 as natural gas prices soared. 2023 has been a different story and the company’s forecasts are for lower output. Still institutional investors bought the stock at a 2:1 clip in the last 12 months. That’s likely to put a floor on CHK stock and investors can capture a solid dividend with a 2.86% yield.  CF Industries (CF) a photo of vast farmlandCF Industries (NYSE:CF) is a U.S.-based producer of agricultural fertilizers. The company should benefit at a time when the government is looking to ensure that companies can onshore their supply chains. That’s not reflected in the CF stock price. The stock is down 31% in the last 12 months and about 20% in 2023 alone.  At some point investors will look to value and that’s where CF Industries is likely to shine. The stock is trading at just 4.37x earnings. That’s down from the 7x earnings it was at just a few months ago.  But sometimes stocks are cheap for a reason. Is that the case with CF stock? It could be. Of all the stocks on this list, it’s the only one that is projected to have negative earnings growth in 2023. But analysts still project a 44% upside for the stock. That and a dividend with a 2.86% yield that is well supported by the company’s free cash flow makes this a compelling buy.   Union Pacific (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is the last stock on my list of the top blue-chip stocks to buy now. Railroad stocks have been under pressure as the supply chain issues that emerged during the pandemic are still getting untangled. Union Pacific hasn’t been spared. UNP stock is down nearly 40% in the last 12 months.  There are signs, however, that the stock may be bottoming. And that may be because the spending from the government’s Infrastructure Bill is working its way into the economy. That would be bullish for railroad stocks in general. Although analysts only forecast about 9% growth in UNP stock, the company has a stable dividend that currently yields $2.64 percent. It also has an annual payout of $5.20 per share. And it’s increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years. That streak will continue as the company has pledged to pay 45% of its future earnings as a dividend to shareholders.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

326,0e60d825-d34a-3aa1-b33a-75bb1af8be5e,AMP,2023-05-12,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights BlackRock, Ameriprise Financial and Invesco",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-blackrock-102010987.html,1683886810,STORY,"['AMP', 'BLK', 'IVZ', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 12, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses like BlackRock, Inc. BLK, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP and Invesco Ltd. IVZ.Industry: Investment ManagementLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2094078/3-investment-management-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-headwindsThe continued shift in investor preference toward passive investment strategies is expected to hamper top-line growth of the Zacks Investment Management industry stocks. Moreover, elevated technology costs will likely hurt profitability to an extent.Amid the pandemic-induced uncertainty, investment management companies benefited from higher volatility and client activity. While client activity remains decent, investment managers are not expected to witness impressive growth in their assets under management (AUM) balances because of volatile asset flows. Nevertheless, firms like BlackRock, Inc., Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and Invesco Ltd. are expected to benefit from an increasing interest rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Investment Management industry consists of companies that manage securities and funds for clients to meet specified investment goals. They earn by charging service fees or commissions. Investment managers are also called asset managers, as they manage hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital and other financial investments for third parties.By appointing an investment manager for one's assets, investors get more diversification options than they would have if they managed their assets by themselves. Investment managers invest their clients' assets in different asset classes, depending on their needs and risk-taking abilities. Hence, the diversification, which investors get by appointing asset managers to manage their assets, helps reduce the impacts of volatility and ensures steady returns over time.3 Investment Management Industry Trends to Keep an Eye onDespite Higher Rates, Shift in Preferences to Result in Muted Growth in Margins: Interest rate hikes since the beginning of 2022 have resulted in an improvement in investment managers' margins. Also, the rise in industry consolidation witnessed since 2020 is likely to continue supporting bottom-line growth.Story continuesHowever, similar to the past few years, the demand for passive investing has been on the rise on the continued need for low-cost investment strategies. Thus, while higher interest rates are expected to continue to positively impact investment managers' margins to some extent in the near term, rising demand for passive investments will partly offset the impact.A Volatile Trend in Asset Flows Likely to Hurt AUM Growth: In 2020 and the first half of 2021, there was a significant rise in equity market volatility and solid client activity, owing to the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, which aided total AUM growth. In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Year 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players.However, of late, AUM growth has not been impressive because of a volatile trend in flows. Thus, the current challenging market conditions are expected to hamper AUM growth to some extent in the near term. Asset managers' top lines are, therefore, expected to be negatively impacted by lower performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Are Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers' bottom line.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 43-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it at the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a dismal earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's bottom-line growth potential. The industry's current-year earnings estimates have been revised 21.4% lower since the end of May 2022.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to keep an eye on, let's check out the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 27.9%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 0.4% and the Zacks Finance Sector has depreciated 9.5%.Industry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.37X. This compares with the highest level of 5.43X, the lowest level of 2.12X and the median of 3.71X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.31X.As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group's P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.44X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry's ratio.3 Investment Management Stocks to Keep an Eye OnBlackRock: The New York, NY-based Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) company is the largest asset manager by assets in the United States, with a market capitalization of $95.5 billion. The company's diversified products, revenue mix and inorganic expansion efforts have been aiding AUM growth. As of Mar 31, 2023, BlackRock had total AUM worth $9.09 trillion.The company's AUM witnessed a seven-year (2016-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9%. Thus, a robust AUM balance will keep aiding the top line. BLK has been continuously strengthening its iShares and exchange-traded funds (ETF) operations. Its efforts to gain market share in the active equity business will likely support profitability.Supported by a solid balance sheet and liquidity position, BlackRock has expanded via acquisitions, both domestic and overseas. In June 2021, the company acquired the Climate Change Scenario Model of Baringa Partners. In February 2021, BLK completed the acquisition of investment management services provider, Aperio Group. Apart from these, over the years, the company has acquired several firms across the globe, thus, expanding its footprint and market share.In the past year, shares of BlackRock have gained 4.8%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised 1.1% lower to $34.45 per share, whereas its 2024 earnings estimates have witnessed an upward revision of 1.1% to $39.94.Ameriprise: Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, the company has a market cap of $30.6 billion. Since 2005-end, AMP has been operating independently of American Express Company. As of Mar 31, 2023, Ameriprise owned, managed and administered assets worth $1.24 trillion. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ameriprise operates a well-diversified portfolio compared with its industry peers. The company constantly modifies its product and service-offering capacity to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, helped the company witness a rise in total net revenues. While net revenues (GAAP basis) witnessed a decline in 2020, the same increased, seeing a CAGR of 2.7% over the five-year period between 2018 and 2022.Moreover, AMP has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations. In November 2021, the company acquired BMO Financial Group's EMEA asset management operations, which will bolster its wealth and asset management businesses, and global diversification efforts. In July 2021, it closed a deal for RiverSource Life Insurance Company (its insurance subsidiary) with Global Atlantic's subsidiary, Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, to reinsure $7 billion of fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies.In 2019, it divested the Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home business. These initiatives, along with a few others, are expected to continue supporting revenue growth.AMP's shares have gained 15.9% over the past year. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has been revised lower by 2.2% to $30 per share. However, earnings estimates for 2024 have been revised marginally upward to $33.40.Invesco: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company — formerly AMVESCAP PLC — operates as an independent investment manager, and offers a wide range of investment products and services. Invesco has offices in more than 20 countries and as of Mar 31, 2023, it had AUM worth $1.48 trillion.The Zacks Rank #3 company, with a market cap of $7.4 billion, has been witnessing a consistent improvement in AUM. Though the total AUM balance declined in 2022, the same witnessed a CAGR of 2.2% over the three years ended 2022. The acquisition of OppenheimerFunds primarily resulted in the rise in the company's AUM, making it one of the leading global asset managers.Moreover, IVZ has been undertaking initiatives to improve operating efficiency. Though the company's operating expenses have recorded a rise in the past, the same has been decreasing since 2021.Apart from a strong presence in the United States, Invesco maintains a solid foothold in Europe, Canada and the Asia Pacific. Acquisitions of the leading U.K.-based advisor-focused digital solutions firm Intelliflo, along with Europe-based Source, a leading, independent specialist provider of ETFs, to improve market share globally continue to support Invesco's global presence. Broad diversification will likely help the company generate further momentum from business in such regions.IVZ's shares have lost 7.8% over the past year. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has been revised 2.5% upward to $1.64 per share. Likewise, earnings estimates for the next year have been revised 1.6% upward to $1.96.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Year 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players. However, of late, AUM growth has not been impressive because of a volatile trend in flows. Thus, the current challenging market conditions are expected to hamper AUM growth to some extent in the near term. Asset managers’ top lines are, therefore, expected to be negatively impacted by lower performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Are Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers’ bottom line.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 43-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it at the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a dismal earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. The industry’s current-year earnings estimates have been revised 21.4% lower since the end of May 2022.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to keep an eye on, let’s check out the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 27.9%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 0.4% and the Zacks Finance Sector has depreciated 9.5%.Two-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.37X. This compares with the highest level of 5.43X, the lowest level of 2.12X and the median of 3.71X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.31X, which the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group’s P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.44X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry’s ratio, which the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)3 Investment Management Stocks to Keep an Eye onBlackRock: The New York, NY-based Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) company is the largest asset manager by assets in the United States, with a market capitalization of $95.5 billion. The company’s diversified products, revenue mix and inorganic expansion efforts have been aiding AUM growth. As of Mar 31, 2023, BlackRock had total AUM worth $9.09 trillion.The company’s AUM witnessed a seven-year (2016-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9%. Thus, a robust AUM balance will keep aiding the top line. BLK has been continuously strengthening its iShares and exchange-traded funds (ETF) operations. Its efforts to gain market share in the active equity business will likely support profitability.Supported by a solid balance sheet and liquidity position, BlackRock has expanded via acquisitions, both domestic and overseas. In June 2021, the company acquired the Climate Change Scenario Model of Baringa Partners. In February 2021, BLK completed the acquisition of investment management services provider, Aperio Group. Apart from these, over the years, the company has acquired several firms across the globe, thus, expanding its footprint and market share.In the past year, shares of BlackRock have gained 4.8%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings has been revised 1.1% lower to $34.45 per share, whereas its 2024 earnings estimates have witnessed an upward revision of 1.1% to $39.94.Price and Consensus: BLKAmeriprise: Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, the company has a market cap of $30.6 billion. Since 2005-end, AMP has been operating independently of American Express Company. As of Mar 31, 2023, Ameriprise owned, managed and administered assets worth $1.24 trillion. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ameriprise operates a well-diversified portfolio compared with its industry peers. The company constantly modifies its product and service-offering capacity to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, helped the company witness a rise in total net revenues. While net revenues (GAAP basis) witnessed a decline in 2020, the same increased, seeing a CAGR of 2.7% over the five-year period between 2018 and 2022.Moreover, AMP has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations. In November 2021, the company acquired BMO Financial Group’s EMEA asset management operations, which will bolster its wealth and asset management businesses, and global diversification efforts. In July 2021, it closed a deal for RiverSource Life Insurance Company (its insurance subsidiary) with Global Atlantic’s subsidiary, Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, to reinsure $7 billion of fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies.In 2019, it divested the Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home business. These initiatives, along with a few others, are expected to continue supporting revenue growth.AMP’s shares have gained 15.9% over the past year. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has been revised lower by 2.2% to $30 per share. However, earnings estimates for 2024 have been revised marginally upward to $33.40.Price and Consensus: AMPInvesco: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company — formerly AMVESCAP PLC — operates as an independent investment manager, and offers a wide range of investment products and services. Invesco has offices in more than 20 countries and as of Mar 31, 2023, it had AUM worth $1.48 trillion.The Zacks Rank #3 company, with a market cap of $7.4 billion, has been witnessing a consistent improvement in AUM. Though the total AUM balance declined in 2022, the same witnessed a CAGR of 2.2% over the three years ended 2022. The acquisition of OppenheimerFunds primarily resulted in the rise in the company's AUM, making it one of the leading global asset managers.Moreover, IVZ has been undertaking initiatives to improve operating efficiency. Though the company’s operating expenses have recorded a rise in the past, the same has been decreasing since 2021.Apart from a strong presence in the United States, Invesco maintains a solid foothold in Europe, Canada and the Asia Pacific. Acquisitions of the leading U.K.-based advisor-focused digital solutions firm Intelliflo, along with Europe-based Source, a leading, independent specialist provider of ETFs, to improve market share globally continue to support Invesco’s global presence. Broad diversification will likely help the company generate further momentum from business in such regions.IVZ’s shares have lost 7.8% over the past year. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has been revised 2.5% upward to $1.64 per share.

One way we fulfill our purpose is through collaborations with organizations that have aligning values. Similarly, with the mission to create impactful, innovative, and successful social enterprises, Villgro® has helped build and accelerate startups in India for over 20 years. And when Cisco and Villgro partnered to organize Tvaran, we leaned into both our missions.Cisco and Villgro selected seven winning startups to explore and accelerate over the coming months through Project Tvaran. An India-based startup accelerator program in its first year, Tvaran means ""acceleration"" in Hindi. Each winning startup is focused on a facet of climate resilience and is founded and run by women entrepreneurs. Meet our first-ever winners of Tvaran:GreenGrahi Solutions, co-founder Shivali SugandGrowing up witnessing Delhi's giant landfills, Shivali Sugand was always keen on changing the paradigm of waste management. In 2021, her purpose found a way, through her startup GreenGrahi Solutions, where she addresses India's three pressing problems: waste management, food insecurity and climate change.According to World Resources Institute, ""the world throws out a billion tons of food each year, while one in nine people remain malnourished."" Most of this waste ends up in landfills where it has adverse economic, environmental, and social repercussions on the local population and on the natural ecosystem.As a circular economy company, GreenGrahi Solutions upcycles food waste into high-quality ingredients for animal and plant nutrition using an insect bio-conversion process. They take food waste from bulk waste generators; let insects use it in climate-controlled chambers powered by a network of sensors and an algorithm, and convert the results into high-quality insect protein, fat, and fertilizer.Story continues""We truly believe that insects and our technology can act as a catalyst to fix the broken food system and empower our farmers,"" Shivali said. ""And can drastically reduce the greenhouse gasses from the current unsustainable waste management and resource-intensive agricultural practices.""Bharat Krushi Seva, co-founder Sharayu LandeIn 2021, 42% of the population in India lived in poverty. And in a overpopulated country with an unknown number of farmers, many do not have access to a quality value chain-like technology, personal advisors, and technical support.Bharat Krushi Seva (BKS) uses remote sensing technology to drive digital and climate-smart agriculture, to help farmers make more informed decisions and focus on precision farming. This gathered information is critical for farmers who are looking to mitigate the impact of climate change while maintaining sustainable and profitable agricultural practices.""By having this information in advance,"" Sharayu explained, ""farmers can make better decisions about resource allocation and optimize their production processes.""BKS' technology provides crop-specific, personalized support, equipping farmers with customized, actionable advice based on farming practices and local conditions. This helps them to improve their crop yield, reduce input costs, manage risks, and make better decisions. This tech-based service provides sustainable and climate-smart farming practices, promoting a healthier environment.Green Delight Innovations Private Limited, founder Niveda RaviIndia faces major social and environmental challenges with plastic waste disposal. Per ResearchGate, in 2010, only 12% of women in India used sanitary pads. By 2016, that number had increased to 57%. Every year the number of feminine hygiene products users grows. This inspired Niveda Ravi to develop a process that benefits both women and the environment.Niveda founded Green Delight Innovations to solve two significant challenges that stem from plastic waste disposal:Plastic - Nearly 113,000 tons of hygiene products are disposed of annually in India. And often, these products are burnt for disposal, which may release harmful gases and toxins into the atmosphere.Chemicals - Almost 70% of reproductive diseases in India are reportedly caused by poor sanitary pad hygiene.Niveda noted that while the ""leaves of the Kenaf plant are edible, the stem goes to waste."" This inspired her to create a processing technology that can extract fibers from the common plant, using no chemicals or plastics, making it suitable for use in feminine hygiene products. Green Delight Innovations is the first startup in the world to make Bliss hygiene pads from Kenaf, and India's First to offer United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)-approved and biobased-certified feminine hygiene products. Additionally, Green Delight operates with the aim to offer gender equality with more direct jobs to women and people who are transgender, and economic growth for women and men in local areas.Niveda revealed, ""Women switching to this technology will experience good health and wellbeing. Women will have better hygiene and sanitation practices. [And this product may offer a] reduction in pollution.""KNP Arises - Green Energy Solutions, co-founder Kirtti VaishnavFrying cooking oil increases the Total Polar Compounds (TPC) value of an oil. And if the oil is reused, consuming it can cause severe health problems, like ""non-communicable diseases, heart ailments, and organ damage."" Cooking oils with a TPC value higher than 25% should not be consumed and should be immediately discarded, according to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). But in India, 60% of used cooking oil can reenter the food chain due to lack of awareness and an unstable food safety infrastructure.Kirtti Viashnav co-founded KNP Arises to collect used cooking oil and convert it into fuel.Through KNP's mobile application, anyone who wants to discard used cooking oil can submit a request. The KNP team then coordinates to collect the oil and transfer it to the KNP warehouse. On collection, the vendor gets paid to dispose of their oil, along with a compliance certificate and ""green"" certificate showing their contribution towards the environment. KNP provides 100% oil traceability through notifications in the mobile application.""Our work will secure millions of people's health. By providing a strong infrastructure, we can safely guard bodies of water,"" Kirtti disclosed. ""And using this fuel will ensure our environment is cleaner and greener.""Swachha Eco Solutions Pvt Ltd, co-founder Victoria D'SouzaAs an environmental activist and social entrepreneur, Victoria D'Souza understood that while plastic is an alternative to metal, there is no alternative to plastic.The use of packaged products has increased exponentially-especially single-use, multi-layered plastic (MLP), like the plastic wrapping around food or shampoo. Long-time exposure to the chemicals within this multi-layered plastic may produce leachate, resulting in water and soil pollution. Currently, India's Plastic Waste Management (PWM) process for MLP is to recycle about 60% and dump the rest in a landfill.Victoria explained, ""We take a look at a variety of ways a collaborative, collective approach helps in creating a clean, green, and sustainable environment.""Through Swachha Eco Solutions, this MLP can be collected, shredded, and mixed with hot bitumen which is sometimes referred to as asphalt or tar. The formulated plastic waste mixture is added to course aggregate, resulting in a mix that can be used for road construction and repair. Swachha Eco Solutions aims to reduce emissions and lifecycle carbon intensity from dumped single-use plastics.Mowo Fleet, founder Jai BharathiEvery city across the world is driving toward the electric vehicle revolution. Many women in India, especially from lower socioeconomic groups, are unaware of this transportation transformation. Jai Bharathi felt it important to include women in sustainable mobility-related livelihoods, so she founded Mowo Fleet.Through Mowo Fleet, Jai redefined urban mobility by bringing women into the driver's seat-specifically on electric two- and three-wheelers. Mowo Fleet uses technology to optimize and schedule commutes and delivery services to enable women to consider driving for their career and maximize their earning potential.And while many women are already willing to drive for their livelihood, it can be a challenge for these women to earn maximum revenue for the hours they spend away from home. Through Mowo Fleet's technology, empty rides are mitigated, providing many women with equal footing.""Being a part of the Villgro-Cisco Tvaran program, we have the opportunity to be mentored as we are at the initial phase of building technology, which will be a game changer in enabling many women to join the sustainable mobility workforce,"" Jai disclosed.Farmers for Forests (ClimateSense Pvt Ltd), founder Krutika Ravishankar""One of the primary reasons why ecosystems like forests, marshes, grasslands, mangroves, peats and bogs are being destroyed at an alarming rate,"" disclosed Krutika Ravishankar, ""is because the services they provide-like carbon sequestration, soil regeneration, fresh water, and pollination-are not being correctly priced by global economic systems."" For example, according to data from the IPBES, insects pollinate 75% of crops globally, a service priced at $577 billion.Thriving ecosystems are key to climate resilience. Krutika co-founded Farmers for Forests to focus on restoring and protecting India's biodiverse forests, in close collaboration with agrarian and Indigenous communities.""Farmers for Forests compensates farmers and communities for the protection and restoration of biodiverse forest cover,"" Krutika explained.Through the use of drones, satellite data, and modified open-source AI algorithms, Farmers for Forests can count trees, identify species, and track forest cover to capture tree health and risk potential for forest fires. This data is used holistically to understand forest health and quantify sequestered carbon and biodiversity levels of the forests and agroforestry plantations-helping to more accurately price services provided by these ecosystems.So far, Farmers for Forests manages more than 2,940 acres of vulnerable forests each year, has planted 600 acres of new forests and agroforestry plantations, and has generated over 17,000 days of rural employment.Congratulations to these seven outstanding Tvaran startup winners. We look forward to seeing how these women entrepreneurs will impact and innovate the future of climate resilience around the world.

QuoteFactors to ConsiderDecisionPoint’s extensive product portfolio of managed services, and professional services like consulting, staging and deployment installation is likely to gain traction. Rising complexities of creating, installing and managing a mobile solution have resulted in this upside for DPSI. Steady momentum witnessed for the company’s recurring revenue SaaS solutions, including packaged and custom-developed software, is likely to have favored first-quarter performance.Increasing adoption of its products and services across verticals like grocery and specialty retail, healthcare, distribution and transportation, along with geographic expansion, is a tailwind.Synergies from acquisitions also bode well. DPSI concluded two buyouts — Advanced Mobile Group and Boston Technologies — in 2022 to boost its position in the lucrative transportation and direct-store delivery verticals.In the quarter under review, the company completed the acquisition of Macro Integration Services which provides hardware, software and project services solutions mainly to companies in the retail sector. It also serves scales grocery, quick-service restaurants or QSR and convenience stores verticals. The addition of new services and capabilities like digital signage and video systems is likely to have boosted DecisionPoint’s margin performance.However, macroeconomic uncertainty, lingering supply-chain troubles and increasing integration risks owing to frequent buyouts might have dented the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for DPSI this time around.

(CSCO): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cisco-systems-130001754.html,1683810001,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned -6.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has lost 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share, indicating a change of +11.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.03 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $56.56 billion and $58.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.7% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.9%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.18%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CSCO, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cisco Systems is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CSCO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 99 cents per share for CSCO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CSCO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.59%  heading into earnings season.Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCisco Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCisco Systems, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.
