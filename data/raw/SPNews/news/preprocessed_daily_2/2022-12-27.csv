You might want to begin with Schwab Treasury Inflation Protected Security (SWRSX). The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSWRSX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Treasury Inflation Protected Security made its debut in March of 2006, and since then, SWRSX has accumulated about $2.75 billion in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by Matthew Hastings who has been in charge of the fund since March of 2006.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 2.41%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 1.59%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 7.67%, the standard deviation of SWRSX over the past three years is 6.98%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 5.78% compared to the category average of 5.87%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.This fund has a beta of 0.82, meaning that it is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, SWRSX has a positive alpha of 2.2, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWRSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.83%. From a cost perspective, SWRSX is actually cheaper than its peers.Story continuesInvestors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineFor additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Mutual Fund Bond, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks to Buy. Kenneth Scott Zuckerberg, lead analyst and senior economist with CoBank's Knowledge Exchange division, told S&amp;P Global Commodities Insights in an interview in August 2022 that farmers and customers around the world may have to face a turbulent market well into 2023 given the upside risks to the prices of agricultural commodities and inputs. Prices of primary crops like corn, soybean, and wheat have been accelerating due to the Russia-Ukraine war, weather constraints, and supply chain bottlenecks. According to Zuckerberg, the Russia-Ukraine war will impact the supply of grain and oilseeds for three or more years as Ukraine is one of the world's largest producers of corn, wheat, and sunflower oil, and the war has tightened the supply of these commodities meaningfully.High energy costs have also made the production of fertilizers costly. Lately, fertilizer prices have normalized relatively. Yet, the likelihood of natural gas supply challenges in the European Union from Russia can result in a steep increase in gas prices and costs of fertilizers. Zuckerberg further noted: ""If they [Russia] pull supply, natural gas prices go up ... it means fertilizer prices go up, and we have a restart to the inflation regardless of what the central banks are doing on interest rates."" Given that China is one of the biggest producers, consumers, and importers of food and grains in the world, Zuckerberg explained that:""I think we can't ignore the China-Taiwan situation because once somebody tells you their intention, it is really important to remember that.""Farmland and agriculture stocks are likely to continue to boom given the uncertainties in the sector will not tamper with the global demand for agricultural inputs and commodities. Investors usually prefer to invest in farmland and agriculture stocks because of their diversification and inflation hedge characteristics. Billionaire Bill Gates is the #1 private farmland owner in the United States. Some of the best agriculture stocks to invest in include The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) according to hedge funds. Gladstone Land Corporation (LAND) is a pure play farmland stock that owns and acquires farm-related properties in the US, however, it failed to make our list because there were only 8 hedge funds with bullish positions in the stock. Farmland Partners Inc (FPI) is also a pure play farmland stock that follows a similar business model, however, Farmland Partners Inc also failed to make our list for the same reason. Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the following agriculture stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 11 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023Kingarion/Shutterstock.comBest Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Buy Heading Into 202311. Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) was incorporated in 2012 and is headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri. It operates as a food technology company that unlocks natural genetic diversity of plants. The company has two segments, Ingredients and Fresh. On November 10, Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) reported a Q3 GAAP loss per share of $0.16 and a revenue of $130.18 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.05 and $45.33 million, respectively. Revenue over the period climbed nearly 307% from the prior-year quarter. On September 30, UBS analyst Cody Ross initiated coverage of Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) with a Buy rating and a $5.00 price target. The company is on the brink of transforming its business model into a ""proprietary/partnership, high margin, asset-light model"", which should contribute 69% of the sales mix by 2025, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) was part of 16 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 17 funds in the last quarter. Like The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) is one of the best agriculture stocks to monitor. 10. ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel, and it operates as a specialty minerals and chemicals company worldwide. The company has four segments – Industrial Products, Potash, Phosphate Solutions, and Innovative Ag Solutions. It is one of the best agriculture stocks to invest in. In Q3 2022, ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) reported adjusted EBITDA of $1,049 million, up 139% versus $438 million in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41.6%, up from 24.5% in the prior quarter. On November 17, Barclays analyst Benjamin Theurer maintained an Equal Weight rating on ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) and lowered the price target on the shares to $11 from $12 after the earnings season. While the analyst remains positive about the broader agriculture space, he believes fiscal 2023 will in part be a year of relatively more normal earnings levels, with results beating performance prior to sanctions against Belarus being introduced and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 17 hedge funds were bullish on ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL), compared to 13 funds in the prior quarter. 9. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Next on our list of the best agriculture stocks is FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC), a Pennsylvania-based agricultural sciences company that provides crop protection, plant health, and professional pest and turf management products. On December 14, FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) declared a $0.58 per share quarterly dividend, a 9.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.53. The dividend is payable on January 19, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 30. On November 15, Loop Capital analyst Christopher Kapsch upgraded FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $149, up from $132. The earlier downgrade was due to his belief that the stock's valuation had gotten ahead of the story, but FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) has executed well, which helped derisk its earnings progression, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 28 hedge funds were long FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) with collective stakes worth $496.5 million, compared to 29 funds in the last quarter worth $361.2 million. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held the biggest stake in the company, consisting of 1.2 million shares worth $130 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“FMC is an agricultural sciences company providing solutions for the protection of crops from different pests. Its products are used by farmers to ensure bugs, weeds and fungi do not negatively impact their harvest. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the company has a rich history dating back to 1883 when inventor John Bean set out to build a better insecticide spray pump. Over the decades, through acquisitions, FMC became a disparate collection of chemical companies. FMC has transformed itself to solely focus on crop chemicals, having acquired DuPont’s crop chemicals portfolio in 2017, and completed the separation of its lithium business in 2019. FMC is now one of the largest patented crop protection companies globally.Its presence is balanced both geographically around the world, as well as from a crop exposure standpoint, with soybeans being the largest at roughly 20% of total revenue. In terms of products, FMC’s portfolio skews toward insecticides, which account for over 60% of its revenue. The remainder are herbicides (~25%), as well as fungicides and other crop chemicals (~15%).High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for FMC include:Attractive ValuationWe believe FMC’s current stock price is offered at a discount to our determination of the company’s intrinsic value given our estimates of both enhanced margins and higher earnings on a normalized basis.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for FMC, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:FMC is poised to benefit from its focus on crop chemicals, as yield gains are needed to support rising food consumption in emerging markets;Continued margin improvements from its product pipeline. These new products should be particularly effective against insects, weeds and fungi that have grown resistant to traditional crop chemicals; andFurther cross-selling of FMC products to DuPont customers. For example, in Argentina, 78% of the customers it gained from the DuPont acquisition were unique to FMC, providing cross-selling opportunities.”8. CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) is one of the top agriculture stocks to monitor. The London-based company designs, manufactures, commercializes, and finances agricultural and construction equipment, trucks, commercial vehicles, buses, and specialty vehicles in North America, Europe, South America, and internationally.

(NYSE:CNHI) simplified and refocused on the customer. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were long CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 25 funds in the last quarter.

(NYSE:CNHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We sold our position in Iveco Group (Italy), in favor of names that, in our opinion, offer a more favorable risk/return profile. Iveco Group’s arrival in the Fund stemmed from CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)’s demerger of its trucks and commercial vehicles business in early January. We continue to hold CNH Industrial as we believe it holds an attractive valuation at its current price.”7. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) provides lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, weed, pest, and disease control products, mulch, and water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods.

Don't Ignore These 2 Consumer Staples Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002647.html,1672063202,STORY,['ADM'],"[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

5,1d5a7198-7cdb-3c4a-afc7-bc1acc653ee0,ADM,2022-12-27,Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-company-adm-140002588.html,1672063202,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 5.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.47 points to a change of +43.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.34 indicates a change of -15.1% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.57 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $102.18 billion and $99.7 billion estimates indicate +19.9% and -2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.68 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. EPS of $1.86 for the same period compares with $0.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.75%. The EPS surprise was +30.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Cigna's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Cigna How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:15% = US$6.7b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.15 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Cigna's Earnings Growth And 15% ROEAt first glance, Cigna seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Cigna's exceptional 23% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 16%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is CI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Cigna Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cigna's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.3%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, Cigna has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Cigna's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-automatic-data-130032299.html,1672146032,STORY,['ADP'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.39bUS$4.83bUS$5.15bUS$5.08bUS$5.37bUS$5.52bUS$5.65bUS$5.79bUS$5.92bUS$6.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.50%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$109bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$109b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$52bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$88b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$241, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Automatic Data ProcessingStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the IT industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.
