Many believe the decision could spark another rally in oil prices. On the other hand, World Trade Organization cautioned that elevated energy costs and higher interest rates could significantly hurt global trade in the coming quarters.Meanwhile, several notable stocks, including Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), received upgrades from Wall Street analysts this morning.In addition, Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) and Illumina, Inc.

Both should have a challenging fundamental outlook (extremely so in the case of WDC) that he would argue discounted by current valuations.He continues to be Underweight on Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ: MU) ($49 price target), the closest comp to Hynix in his coverage, but with materially different trading patterns around the two stocks.In the long term, Micron has a healthy balance sheet and continues to execute well in product roadmaps and like-for-like price declines.Moore generally does not disagree with views that the company is in a strong position longer term.Challenges drive the cautious view he foresees in the next 12 months versus an optimistic consensus.Price Action: LRCX shares traded lower by 0.29% at $399.46 on the last check Wednesday.See more from BenzingaYMTC Ban Likely A Plus For Micron &amp; Western Digital, While A Minus For AMD &amp; NVIDIA, Analyst SaysSTMicroelectronics To Build Italy Chip Plant With Government Aid To Beef Up Its EV PresenceDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The $425 million investment is expected to create more than 50 new full-time jobs. It will also support the company's strategy to expand its capabilities and increase participation in the automotive and consumer durables markets. The start-up of the galvanizing line is expected in mid-2025.The company’s board also approved a galvanizing line to be built in the western United States. It plans to announce the details at a future date. These investments are in sync with the company’s strategy of shifting its mix to higher margin value-added products.Nucor, which is a prominent player in the steel space along with Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD, United States Steel Corporation X and ArcelorMittal S.A. MT, said that the new galvanizing line in South Carolina will have an annual capacity of roughly 500,000 tons. It will be able to produce galvanized steel up to 72 inches wide.The company, last month, announced that it will invest $200 million over a five-year period in mill modernization projects at its Nucor Steel Berkeley division in South Carolina. The investment will include the construction of a new air separation unit for supplying industrial gases for the mill's steelmaking operations.Nucor operates five strategically located sheet mills that uses thin slab casters to make flat-rolled steel for automotive, appliance, construction, pipe and tube, and other industrial and consumer applications. The current capacity of its sheet mills is estimated at around 13 million tons annually. A sixth sheet mill is currently under construction in West Virginia. The company also has majority stake in California Steel Industries as well as a joint venture automotive galvanizing line in Mexico.Nucor recently issued its guidance for the third quarter of 2022. It projects third-quarter earnings to be between $6.30 and $6.40 per share. This suggests a decline from $9.67 per share in second-quarter 2022 and $7.28 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company expects earnings to decline significantly in the steel mills segment on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter. The expected decline is due to metal margin contraction and lower shipment volumes, especially at its sheet and plate mills.Nucor expects its steel products segment to deliver another strong quarter, with earnings roughly in-line with second-quarter 2022. Earnings for the raw materials unit are forecast to be flat on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter. The company continues to believe that 2022 will be the most profitable year in its history.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They require investors to believe in their long-term potential to gain traction and cement their positioning in their respective sectors.The reward for long-term stocks tends to be quite high. However, there’s no certainty that the thesis will pan out as advertised; therefore, it’s best to approach long-term stocks with cautious optimism.The current market is remarkably frustrating for investors, and perhaps the best course of action is to dig up the best long-term stocks to buy for troubled times. The market has been on a downward trajectory since the start of the year, and it isn’t conducive for short-term plays at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe benchmark interest rates will continue to rise until inflation rates are under control.

First, they are unlikely to default on their obligations and perform sensitive work that cannot be performed in remote or hybrid working arrangements. Therefore, it provides stability of continuing cash flows which is crucial for OPI.Moreover, leasing volume in its most recent quarter was up by double-digit margins with average terms of roughly 10 years. Also, overall occupancy levels stood at almost 90%, which dispels concerns regarding renewal risk.Story continuesIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

The years-long consolidation pattern in its stock has been a put-off for investors. However, its recent results paint a positive picture for its future, making it one of the best long-term stocks to buy today.Its second-quarter results saw earnings of $2.31, beating analyst targets of $2.27. Moreover, sales of $15.54 billion also came in ahead of consensus expectations of $15.18 billion. The results are in large part a result of its multi-year efforts to become an effective hybrid-cloud services provider.Tech infrastructure sales during the quarter rose by 25%, excluding currency impact, and due to an 18% jump in its Z Systems hybrid and cloud computers sales.In the first half of 2022, the firm reported strong free cash flows of $3.3 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the same period last year. For the full year, it expects to make $10 billion in FCF, up from $6.5 billion last year.Upwork (UPWK)The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.Source: Funstock / Shutterstock.comUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) is one of the top freelancing and work-management marketplaces. The massive growth of the freelance market has helped the business generate double-digit revenue expansion over the past five years.Moreover, the pandemic has significantly accelerated the trend towards remote working and freelancing, which bodes remarkably well for UPWK.Upwork’s recent results have held up impressively, despite fears of a potential slowdown linked to Russia. It continues to add new features to its platforms, such as consultations, a client marketplace plan, and other extensors to expand its market share.As we advance, the recessionary pressures will likely lead to layoffs and more people will join the gig economy. Also, the firm is looking at a massive $1.3 trillion market opportunity in gross services volume over the long term.Sea Ltd (SE)SEA Limited - Shopee app on mobile phoneSource: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.comSea Ltd (NYSE:SE) is one of the top Southeast Asian eCommerce and gaming giants. It was among a few eCommerce businesses that thrived during the pandemic, posting triple-digit top-line growth numbers. However, its growth rates have cooled off for its gaming and eCommerce segments which have investors fretting over its future.Though its growth rates have normalized considerably, they are still up by double-digit margins in its most recent quarter. In cutting down its losses, the company looks to reduce its presence in Latin America, shut its operations in India and downsize its core Southeast Asian businesses.These efforts will free up more resources to potentially invest in SeaMoney, its fintech arm that continues to grow at an extraordinary pace. The Southeast Asian eCommerce market will likely witness the fastest digital sales growth worldwide this year, which points to massive remaining upside potential.QuantumScape (QS)QuantumScape logo on thumbnail for Luke Lango's Hypergrowth Investing podcast.Source: InvestorPlaceQuantumScape (NYSE:QS)  is a company involved in researching and developing solid-state battery technology.These batteries are expected to be far superior to the lithium-ion batteries currently in use, with greater energy density and charging times.Moreover, it boasts agreements from some of the leading automotive giants already and is likely to gain massive traction if it can produce at a meaningful scale over the next few years. It remains a speculative bet, though, but perhaps significantly more attractive, considering it trades more than 63% down this year.The firm’s massive patent and intellectual property portfolio give it a major edge over its competition. Moreover, it has nailed its objectives so far and is coming off its most successful year to date.It successfully tested out 10-layer cells last year and is now testing out 24-layer cells. Though it has a long way to go, there’s no denying its moonshot potential.Nucor (NUE)Nucor logo close-up on website page.

Nucor (NYSE:NUE) was one of the big names that benefitted immensely from the market tailwinds, reporting a massive $6.8 billion in earnings last year compared to $721.5 million in 2020.The momentum carried into this year with booming steel demand due to the economic sanctions against Russia. Hence, NUE is in for another incredible showing this year.However, the market is spooked by recession worries and a whole host of other macroeconomic factors. Hence, the stock trades at a hefty discount to its forward sales estimates.Another incentive for long-term investors is that Nucor is one of the cleanest steelmakers worldwide, making it an appealing ESG investment.

It plans to run its commercial operations by 2024.Flying taxis are the need of the hour in some metropolitan cities.

Unum (UNM), which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This insurance company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 61.59%.For the most recent quarter, Unum was expected to post earnings of $1.23 per share, but it reported $1.91 per share instead, representing a surprise of 55.28%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.81 per share, while it actually produced $1.36 per share, a surprise of 67.90%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Unum. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Unum currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 1, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

UNM surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.A well-liked tool among traders, the 20-day simple moving average offers a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. This is very beneficial to short-term traders, as it smooths out short-term price trends and gives more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Moving Average Chart for UNMShares of UNM have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 9.6%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that UNM could be poised for a continued surge.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider UNM's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 4 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on UNM for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Selling at an average price of US$551, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher ScientificOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$542 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$540. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Thermo Fisher Scientific didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Thermo Fisher Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Thermo Fisher Scientific shares. In total, Independent Director Jim Manzi sold US$486k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Thermo Fisher Scientific Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own about US$347m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Thermo Fisher Scientific Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Thermo Fisher Scientific.

New deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings are helping the company to grow its profit levels and capture a bigger portion of the market.Further, an improving commercial business environment is likely to expedite its growth. With the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic slowly wearing off, its commercial business is expected to thrive. As the unemployment rate goes down, employers are buying more and more insurance products for their workers. UNH, with its wide range of product portfolio, is likely to face rising demand for its services.Thanks to its solid performance, UnitedHealth expects adjusted net earnings per share for 2022 to be within the $21.40-$21.90 band, up from the previous projection of $21.20-$21.70. The mid-point of the updated outlook suggests a 13.8% improvement from the 2021 figure. Notably, UNH beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.7%.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteIts health service business, Optum, is becoming increasingly valuable and is crucial to the company’s diversification strategy. The primary growth drivers for Optum are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services and international operations. Optum’s improved capabilities help UnitedHealth win new contracts.The company made an extensive collaboration with Walmart Inc. WMT, the renowned operator of retail, wholesale and E-commerce stores worldwide, with an initial aim to benefit Medicare beneficiaries. The deal will enable Optum to back clinicians at Walmart Health with analytics and decision support tools.UnitedHealth’s competitive product portfolio and efficient execution abilities enable it to win new government contracts. It was recently selected by the Department of Health and Human Services in Nebraska to manage the state's Medicaid program, Heritage Health. Along with UNH, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH were also chosen to administer the program.Story continuesUnitedHealthcare has been present in Nebraska for 26 years and employs more than 750 people in the state. The company has a network of 100 hospitals and over 14,000 physicians and caregivers in Nebraska. It serves more than 500,000 individuals in the state.UnitedHealth’s healthy balance sheet with strong financial flexibility, marked by consistent cash generated from operations over the years, enables it to take shareholder-friendly moves. This June, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 13.8%. Its dividend has grown at 17.6% per year for the past five years.The company’s long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to increase the dividend for the years to come. It has also been aggressively repurchasing shares. The company expects to buy back shares worth $5-6 billion this year.UNH's free cash flow, in the trailing 12-month period, increased 2.8% year over year to $20.5 billion. It expects operating cash flow for 2022 to be around $24 billion, marginally up from $22.3 billion in 2021.However, there are a few factors that can impede the stock’s growth potential.UnitedHealth’s rising operating expenses can affect its profit levels. The metric jumped 12.3% last year, primarily due to a rise in medical costs and operating costs. Even in the first half of 2022, the metric further escalated 13.7% year over year to $146.4 billion.Its global business is facing some headwinds. In 2019 and 2020, membership from its international business fell 8% and 5.2%, respectively. Although it witnessed a recovery in the membership figure last year, the same seems to be on a decline again, with a 0.4% year-over-year fall as of Jun 30, 2022.UnitedHealth is also grappling with significant interest expenses, which might weigh on the company’s margins. In the first half of 2022, interest expenses increased 11.5% from the year-ago period. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Huntington Bancshares in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -9.53% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.16 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 4.44%. In comparison, the Banks - Midwest industry's yield is 3.02%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.73%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $0.62 is up 2.5% from last year. Huntington Bancshares has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.42%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Huntington Bancshares's current payout ratio is 45%, meaning it paid out 45% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.HBAN is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $1.46 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 35.19%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, HBAN is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Oct. 5, NBC News reported. It comes during an especially vulnerable period for the global oil supply, which has been weakened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as by ongoing supply chain problems.Industry researcher Capital Economics estimates that global oil prices will rise to about $100 a barrel from $93 currently, NBC News noted. U.S. benchmark prices are expected to climb to $92 a barrel from $88.The national average price of gasoline in the United States was $3.867 a gallon as of Oct. 6. That’s up from $3.782 a week ago and $3.779 a month ago but still well down from the all-time high of $5.016 set on June 14, 2022.Claudio Galimberti, head of Americas analysis at Rystad Energy, said U.S. gas prices could increase by about 10% in much of the country, The Washington Post reported. But a lot depends on how other market factors play out.“The intention of the OPEC Plus cut was to break the fall in crude prices since the summer,” Bob McNally, an energy analyst at the Rapidan Energy Group, told the WaPo. “If they succeed, then gasoline pump prices should also stop falling and range around current levels, until other market drivers impact the price.”Gas prices will likely be impacted more in some regions of the country than others.“The regional differences in gas prices are stark at the moment, with prices on the West Coast hitting $6 a gallon and higher, while Texas and Gulf Coast states have prices dipping below $3 in some areas,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a Mon., Oct. 3 news release.He noted that at least six California refineries are undergoing maintenance, and “there is limited pipeline supply to the West Coast from locations east of the Rockies.”Story continuesThe Biden administration — which has put a high priority on bringing gas prices down ahead of the 2022 midterm elections — was quick to lash out at OPEC’s decision. As the WaPo reported, administration officials have pressured OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to produce more oil to compensate for the global shortage caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Biden himself even visited Saudi leaders during a trip to Jiddah.“The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC Plus to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,” U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said in a joint statement.The White House does have a couple of options to help offset OPEC’s move. One is to tap into the U.S.’s strategic petroleum reserve, which it has already done this year. Another is to lobby hard for passage of the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels bill, which would penalize other oil-producing countries by opening them up to antitrust suits.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?Discover: How Will Hurricane Ian Affect the Economy?The non-partisan NOPEC bill was sponsored by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and passed 17-4 in the Senate Judiciary Committee back in May, Reuters reported.

Analysts called the decision a political blow against the president.The White House is concerned the cuts could drive up gasoline prices for American drivers ahead of the midterm elections, and could give Russia's battered economy a boost. It called the OPEC+ move ""shortsighted"", and one US official said the administration was ""having a spasm and panicking,"" CNN reported.""It's clear that OPEC+ is aligning with Russia with today's announcement,"" White House spokesperson Karin Jean-Pierre said, per media reports. The White House did not immediately respond to an Insider request for comment.Many analysts say OPEC+ is more focused on bolstering crude prices, which have trended lower in recent months thanks to worries a looming global recession could hit demand for oil.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark price, were down slightly at $93.27 a barrel early Thursday, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were also edging lower at $87.63 a barrel.It's not clear how much oil could enter the market if the deal goes through, as Venezuela's oil industry has been hurt by underinvestment and mismanagement, OANDA analyst Craig Erlam told Insider.Story continuesThe amount could be substantial, he said, pointing to a US-led effort to limit the price paid for Russian oil and oil products.""Any deal could provide some relief in the market at a time when a price cap on Russian crude threatens its output levels and OPEC+ is intent on squeezing the market,"" he said.The proposed deal between the US and Venezuela would ease the sanctions in return for political concessions from President Nicolás Maduro's government, the WSJ reported. His regime would need to rekindle suspended talks with its political opposition about free and fair presidential elections, it said.But US officials warned the deal could still fall through, if Maduro's government doesn't follow through.In addition, the White House said it has no plans to change its policy on sanctions against Venezuela without ""constructive steps"" by the country's regime, Reuters reported.""Our sanctions policy on Venezuela remains unchanged. We will continue to implement and enforce our Venezuela sanctions,"" Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement to Reuters.Talks between the US and Venezuela on easing sanctions, begun by the Trump administration in 2019, have been in progress since Russia invaded Ukraine as the US looked to secure new sources of energy.

In a securities filing earlier this week, Musk offered to go forward with the deal if Twitter’s suit was put on hold.Story continuesTwitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment after regular business hours on the deposition being delayed.Musk skipped out on other deposition dates in the case. He cancelled a Sept. 28 meeting to answer questions because of Covid-19 concerns, according to court filings. He also demanded that the deposition be conducted in Texas instead of Delaware.Musk backed away from his planned Twitter purchase earlier this year, claiming the company hadn’t leveled with him and investors about the number of bot accounts that artificially pump up advertising revenue. Twitter countered that the concerns were a pretext for Musk when he started feeling buyer’s remorse.In the past, Musk –- chief executive officer of electric-car maker Tesla Inc. -- has turned belligerent in pre-trial questioning in other court cases focused on his deal-making efforts.In a deposition tied to a suit by Tesla investors over Musk’s buyout of renewal-power company SolarCity, the billionaire belittled a lawyer for shareholders who argued the deal was rife with conflicts.“To bail out SolarCity was good for the world you’re telling us?” investors’ attorney Randy Baron asked in a pre-trial query.“Advancing solar is absolutely good for the world,” Musk shot back. “Do you just think about money? What is your purpose in life?” Musk’s deposition testimony was played in the 2021 trial of the SolarCity dispute.During his cross-examination at trial, Musk told a Delaware judge he didn’t respect Baron, who he considered to be “a bad human being” who specialized in asking deceptive questions. The judge ultimately ruled for Musk in the case.The case over the Twitter buyout is Twitter v.

38,68116330-fe6f-35fc-9c24-0e965d99d250,MS,2022-10-06,Morgan Stanley upgrades Ford stock to Overweight,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/morgan-stanley-upgrades-ford-stock-134500010.html,1664977500,VIDEO,"['MS', 'MS-PO', 'MS-PP', 'F']","[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss Morgan Stanley upgrading Ford from Equal to Overweight.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Welcome back. After two straight days of big gains for the market, we were seeing a little bit of a consolidation in the pre-market off of that decent ADP jobs report. We'll see if that reverses course before 10:00 AM. But Brad, let's start with a few hot tickers on our platform here.Shares of Ford on the move after influential Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas raised his rating on the automaker from equal weight to overweight. Jonas thinks the pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors and that the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act could boost Ford's US electric vehicle business. Jonas did have a more downbeat take on Ford rival, GM, though.But let's lock in on Ford. This comes really after a major sell off in Ford in recent weeks following that major financial warning from Ford a couple of weeks ago. So certainly the sell off justified, but maybe a little bit overdone here, at least according to Jonas.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and we just got September sales this week that really kind of highlighted some of the demand that Ford is seeing, at least at this point in time. And in a key category here. When you think about the F-series, and how well that has performed for them for decades, and the interest that is now overflowing into the EV landscape too. They highlighted that in September, F-150 Lightning continues right now as America's best-selling electric pickup truck.And so with that in mind, with the shift that Ford is making and through its two businesses now that it's essentially going to be moving forward with in the ice side of the business. And then on the other side, you've got the Model E side of the business, which is electric focused. It's really going to come back to how well they're able to sell through that pickup truck and how much-- and how well they're producing that. So it could provide them the best catalysts for some of that long-term value that Adam Jonas is looking at here.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: And Jonas going, I would say, going a little bit savage on General Motors here. So obviously not upgrading the stock like he did with Ford. But noting this, he moves the valuation of GM China to zero, which is interesting because Cadillac, which is under that GM umbrella, has always done very, very well in China, and to my recollection has been doing well in China. So interesting to see that.Also removes General Motors' Cruise and Ultium battery, third-party battery, business from the valuation model. So that is an interesting maneuver as well. But clearly Morgan Stanley, influential analyst, more bullish on Ford than GM.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and the Inflation Reduction Act also noting that could boost Ford's US electric vehicle business here too. But it's still going to come back down to getting the parts, getting the components so that you don't have just a shell vehicle that is sitting out there.[INTERPOSING VOICES]BRIAN SOZZI: You have to have heated seats.BRAD SMITH: You've got to have the heated seats.BRIAN SOZZI: That's like at a minimum now.BRAD SMITH: Well, I mean, one of their competitors is going to charge up for that. So they've got to ensure that they're also not going to be layering on that subscription cost for the heated seats. However, for Ford, at least in the broader context of the automotive landscape right now, over the next two to three years as some of the capacity for chips does ramp up in production, especially domestically here, it's really finding those partnerships, securitizing those deals to make sure that you have the chip supply in order to just make sure that there aren't the production snags that are going to result in shortages affecting tens of thousands of vehicles too.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. And I think what you're seeing too, and you mentioned, you're always talking about chips, Brad, but also I think you're finally now starting to see cars become a full connected experience and create that recurring software revenue. GM has gotten pretty crafty.They have an app called My Chevrolet that lets you check the diagnostics of these cars via an app. Well, it's not free. It costs $25 a month at a minimum. And if you want the premium one, if you want to check your tires and how much battery life you have in your car, it's about $40 a month.So it is-- they're trying to create recurring revenue after they sell you that vehicle. And General Motors is doing a pretty good job of it. It's a pretty slick system.BRAD SMITH: Can't you just sit-in the car and check those things?BRIAN SOZZI: Well, you could, but if I'm here right now, and I'm wondering if my tires at home have air, I'd like to do that. But is it worth $25 a month? I don't know. I don't it is.BRAD SMITH: It could be. It could be. If it mitigates some of the risk for you and your vehicle experience there, everyone.BRIAN SOZZI: Still not on Prime, right?BRAD SMITH: Still not on Prime. Yeah.]"
39,6643ace1-fb8f-3481-be39-2932d68c21d0,MS,2022-10-06,"After losing 13% in the past year, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-13-past-morgan-stanley-130113685.html,1664974873,STORY,['MS'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$7.7b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 13% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Morgan Stanley. See our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Morgan Stanley does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Morgan Stanley's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. With 7.1% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 8 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Morgan Stanley insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$365m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 22% of the Morgan Stanley shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Morgan Stanley better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, both FirstEnergy and NextEra Energy are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.08, while NEE has a forward P/E of 28.67. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.40. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.97.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 1.97. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

(NYSE:CRM) shares last year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-money-bank-insiders-divested-120121835.html,1665057681,STORY,['CRM'],"[Last week, Salesforce, Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) stock jumped 4.0%, but insiders who sold US$106m worth of stock in over the past year are likely to be in a better position. Selling at an average price of US$173, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Salesforce Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, sold US$53m worth of shares at a price of US$182 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$156. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Salesforce didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Salesforce insiders own 3.1% of the company, currently worth about US$4.9b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Salesforce Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Salesforce insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Salesforce insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Salesforce and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBut note: Salesforce may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

On that day, Salesforce.com is projected to report earnings of $1.21 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.72%.

Set water heater thermostat at 120°F. This reduces the amount of energy it takes to produce and maintain hot water and reduces the risk of scalding by not overheating it.Microwave and save. Reheating leftovers and cooking in a microwave takes less time and uses up to 80% less energy than a standard oven.Seal air leaks.

The tech giant is partnering with the NBA on a new app with, quote, wall-to-wall content from every NBA game when the league returns on October 18. Well, Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle has been following all the action for us. Allie, what are you keeping an eye on here?ALLIE GARFINKLE: So Rachelle, this is a massive expansion of a partnership that dates back to the beginning of the pandemic. And I think timing is key here. This feels like a little bit like a coming out party, right? This is happening as big tech and big sports are becoming increasingly entwined, right?We have Apple's halftime show. We have Amazon's Thursday Night Football. And we also have the Mariners partnership as we talked about in the last block that Amazon has. But the way I see it here, yes, the NBA needed to improve its digital strategy. But for Microsoft, they're announcing they're ready to compete on that stage.DAVE BRIGGS: And Allie, Apple and Amazon are already in here. How does Microsoft's play differ from theirs?ALLIE GARFINKLE: Yeah, it is different, Dave, right? Streaming-- when I was talking to Microsoft North America president, Deb Cupp, what she said is that streaming is part of this equation, but not all of it. The goal is for this to be an app that is a hub for the fan experience. So merch, tickets, fantasy-- you name it.Comparatively, right, these other partnerships at Apple and Amazon are about broadcasting rights. They feel very acquisitional. So what I would say, Dave, is that Microsoft is taking its own big tech approach to sports. They're doing it their way.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Crossover action on and off the court there, indeed.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Oct. 5, 2022Google is selling you on its softwareGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) is set to unveil its latest Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones and its first-ever smartwatch, the aptly named Pixel Watch, during an event on Thursday in Brooklyn.The show should be replete with plenty of talk about how Google’s AI smarts make its hardware superior to offerings from competitors like Apple. What’s more, the Pixel Watch will give the tech giant a chance to show off why it spent $2.1 billion to acquire Fitbit in 2021.But, according to experts, Google’s hardware strategy isn’t about sticking it to Apple (AAPL) in terms of sales or trying to outmuscle its ecosystem partner Samsung. Rather, it’s all about showing global manufacturers what’s possible when you combine the right hardware and software.“I think of the Google hardware as loss leaders,” Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst at Gartner, told Yahoo Finance. “They're not making hardware for the sake of making hardware. It's to showcase their own services and capabilities.”An added bonus? Google’s hardware gets more users to sign up for its services and allows it to gather more data on how consumers use those platforms. After all, the more Google understands how you use its features, and the more it can collect data on your web searches, the better it can target you with ads.Google has been releasing its own smartphones since 2010, but it's still nowhere near as popular as Samsung, which controls 21% of the global market share, or Apple, which holds 16% of the market, according to Counterpoint Research.Google CEO Sundar Pichai. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)And that not only helps Google, but, eventually, the likes of Samsung and its Android cohorts, while making Apple look like it’s standing still — at least as far as software goes.Story continuesGoogle leads with softwareGoogle’s prior Pixel phones never stood out in terms of overall performance. Their cameras, at least from a component standpoint, didn’t match up to Samsung’s or Apple’s. It’s Google’s software capabilities that shine.When Google introduced its Night Sight software for the Pixel in 2018, its low-light photos blew away the competition. Google has pushed other software capabilities in the ensuing years, including calling features that navigate automated phone center call lines for you and deep integration with Google Assistant. But Google isn’t rolling out these software updates to show up companies like Samsung that use Android to power their devices. Instead, Google is trying to demonstrate the full potential of Android devices.Google's Pixel lineup has been around for years. (Photo by Josh Edelson / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOSH EDELSON/AFP/Getty Images)“This is all about demonstrating how the Android experience can be, or this is how the Wear OS experience can be, and this is how they can all work together in concert,” Ramon Llamas, research director for mobile devices and AR/VR at IDC, told Yahoo Finance.Google isn’t the only company to take this approach. Look no further than Microsoft (MSFT) and its Surface line of products for a major software distributor that built its own hardware to showcase its offerings. The company puts out its own laptops, laptop-tablet hybrids, foldable smartphones, and hybrid all-in-one desktop at a premium price, with the goal of demonstrating what Microsoft has to offer.Each of those, except for the Duo, shows how a clean design language coupled with Microsoft’s Windows 11 operating system can come together to make truly desirable PCs. It worked, too. Companies ranging from Dell and Lenovo to HP and ASUS are pumping out stylish systems and you can, at least partly, thank Microsoft for that.It's not just looks either. Google’s Tensor chip, which is designed specifically for the company’s AI-powered software, is also part of the equation.“It's about setting an example for other vendors,” Nguyen explained. “In this case it's vendors that use Android. The whole Tensor chip, I think that was an announcement to say, ‘Hey, this is why you need a dedicated AI/ML chip in a personal device.’ ”The Pixel Watch should follow the same formula, providing users with solid looks and software meant to elevate the Wear OS brand and get third-party hardware partners thinking more about how Google’s software and their own hardware can meld in new, interesting ways.More data for GoogleOf course, Google is an advertising company first. And it aims to get more consumers to use its variety of services to ensure the Silicon Valley behemoth has plenty of data to target you with ads.That’s why Google loads up third-party Android devices with its Maps, Gmail, Google Search, and Assistant apps. It’s also why Google paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion as of 2020 to keep Google as the default search engine on its Safari browser. And putting those apps on its own handsets makes it far easier to reach users.It’s also a means to ensure that you stay with Google over the long run. Just like Apple and its vast ecosystem of apps and devices keeps users hooked on its platforms and services, Google wants to give you a reason to stick around.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) shareholders have enjoyed a 81% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 42% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Paychex There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Paychex achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 13%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Paychex has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Paychex's TSR for the last 5 years was 109%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Paychex shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 0.6% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 18%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Paychex better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Paychex .But note: Paychex may not be the best stock to buy.

But some other enhanced benefits, including hourly pay hikes, were given only to employees who are not in a union.Starbucks is ""weaponizing benefits and wage increases to discourage workers from organizing,"" Warren said in emailed remarks to Reuters. Bargaining is tentatively set to begin on various days this month at some stores.August, the National Labor Relations Board accused Starbucks of illegally withholding raises from unionized workers.Starbucks said on a company blog that labor law requires it to negotiate any changes in benefits or working conditions with the union representing those employees.

American Express announced this week in an emailed press release that it is offering four-month subscriptions to Panera's Unlimited Sip Club beverage program to consumers and corporate card members for a limited time.For the financial services company, this partnership creates an additional loyalty perk. For the restaurant chain, meanwhile, the partnership has the potential to incentivize many consumers who have not engaged with the brand in the past to become regular customers. There were 56.4 million Amex cards in the U.S. last year, according to a regulatory filing.Indeed, Panera often offers free subscription promotions as a way to get consumers in through the restaurant’s doors. Even consumers who don’t use Amex are being offered a free two-month subscription, suggesting that the program functions as a loss-leader, attracting customers to the brand so that they can purchase other items from which Panera can make a profit.Panera joins other restaurants looking beyond their own brands to drive loyalty, both by offering in-restaurant deals to other brands’ customers and by promising rewards from other brands to their own customers.For instance, IHOP, the California-based casual dining breakfast chain with more than 1,700 locations around the world, announced in August that it has partnered with Xbox to make gaming rewards available to the brand’s “International Bank of Pancakes” rewards program. The pancake chain is offering members of its loyalty program a one-month free trial of the subscription offering Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a bundle of premium add-ons for the racing video game Forza Horizon 5 and download codes for survival video game Grounded through the end of this month.See also: IHOP Announces Xbox Rewards as Restaurants Explore Cross-Brand LoyaltyStory continuesPlus, last year, Starbucks, the world’s largest restaurant brand by revenue, launched a partnership with Air Canada that lets members of the carrier’s rewards program “double-dip,” earning loyalty points for both the airline and the coffeehouse with purchases at participating Starbucks locations.“Through blockchain or other innovative technologies, we are exploring how to tokenize Stars and create the ability for other merchants to connect their rewards program to Starbucks Rewards,” Starbucks’ then-CEO Kevin Johnson told analysts on a call a year ago. “This will enable customers to exchange value across brands, engage in more personalized experiences, enhance digital services and exchange other loyalty points for Stars at Starbucks.”You may also like: Starbucks Looks to Double-Dip Loyalty With Blockchain-Enabled Cross-Brand RewardsAggregators are getting into the game, too. For instance, Grubhub announced in July a commercial agreement with Amazon to offer U.S. Prime customers receive a free one-year Grubhub+ membership. The following month, the aggregator unveiled a similar partnership with Bank of America to offer a free yearlong membership to cardholders.Related news: For Grubhub, Is Two Partners in Two Months Too Much?By setting their sights beyond the restaurant category, restaurants and aggregators can drive deeper loyalty with their customers, building relationships in other aspects of their day-to-day lives.PYMNTS research finds that top-performing brands are those that engage consumers across the pillars of the connected economy — how they work, pay and are paid, shop, eat, bank, travel, connect with others, have fun, stay well and live. Partnerships such as Panera’s and Grubhub’s extend the brand experience to how they pay, bank and shop, while those such as IHOP’s extend them to how they connect with others and have fun, and Starbucks’ to how they travel.Read more: How Consumers Live in the Connected Economy]"

It will disrupt thousands of small businesses, hospitals may struggle to get their orders, children who rely on schools for their meals may not get them and the nation's supply chain will be further stressed.Each Sysco company is committed to serving as many customers as possible.

With little sign concerns like inflation, interest rates, and a possible recession aren’t going away anytime soon, this trend could carry on in the months ahead. However, there is a silver lining. The 2022 bear market has created great opportunities among consumer stocks to buy.Pushed down to attractive valuations, and now sporting higher dividend yields, these stocks could provide solid long-term returns, in two ways. First, even it takes time for equities to get back into “bull market mode,” steady dividends from these names could result in a positive total return from your position.Second, oversold due to current “doom and gloom,” a combination of continued earnings growth, plus a market rebound, could result in gradual price appreciation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you are a long-term investor, now’s the time to add these seven consumer stocks to buy for your portfolio, all but one of which earn an “A” rating in my Dividend Grader.ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$80.45COSTCostco$472.27ETDEthan Allen Interiors$21.14HBBHamilton Beach Brands$11.67MDLZMondelez International$54.83MEDMedifast$108.36WHRWhirlpool$134.81Consumer Stocks to Buy: Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comIt may seem odd to consider Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) a “hard-hit” stock. Yet, while shares in this agribusiness giant are up 18.5% year-to-date, they have pulled back a fair amount since April.Earlier this year, ADM stock went on a tear, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The invasion caused a big jump in grain and other food commodity prices. During the quarter ending June 30, ADM’s earnings per share (or EPS) came in at $2.18, up 73% from the prior year’s quarter.Recession concerns recently have weighed on ADM. However, this may be a market overreaction. Shares today trade for 13.1 times 2023 estimated earnings, a low forward multiple. ADM stock, earning an A in Dividend Grader, has a forward dividend yield of 1.8%, with a nearly 30 year track record of dividend growth.Story continuesCostco (COST)Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock PriceSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comIn recent months, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares have been hit by a double-whammy. First, rising interest rates have put pressure on growth stocks valuations. Second, a sharp drop in consumer sentiment has led to the market shunning retail stocks.As a result, COST stock has fallen by around 17% this year. However, far from a warning sign, this sell-off gives you the opportunity to load up on a long-term winner while it finds itself out of favor among investors. As I’ve argued previously, this retail discount club operator is considerably more inflation and recession-resistant than its peers.Costco has historically been resilient during challenging economic times. This leaves shares well-positioned for a gradual comeback. COST typically isn’t viewed as a dividend stock, but earning a B rating in Dividend Grader, its modest payout (0.75% forward yield) has grown by an average of 12.8% over the past five years.Ethan Allen Interiors (ETD)Ethan Allen store exterior and logoSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comShares in Ethan Allen Interiors (NYSE:ETD) have fallen to rock-bottom prices. Anticipating a severe reversal in operating results, after the tailwinds resulting from the pandemic recovery, the market has pushed this manufacturer and retailer of home furnishes to a heavily discounted valuation making it one of the long-term consumer stocks to buy.Currently, ETD stock sells for just 7 times estimated earnings. Since the late 2000s, Ethan Allen has only briefly traded at such low multiples, typically trading for between 10 and 20 times earnings. With the potential to gradually rise to its historic valuation, ETD is also a great dividend stock opportunity.Earning an A rating in Dividend Grader, Ethan Allen shares currently offer a nearly 6% forward yield. Over the past five years, ETD’s dividend has gone up by an average of 10.5% per year. With a payout ratio of just 29.26%, there’s ample room for a further increase.Hamilton Beach Brands (HBB)Homepage of Hamilton BeachSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comHamilton Beach Brands (NYSE:HBB) is another familiar consumer name, now trading at a deep value price.Pessimism about near-term consumer spending has led the market to value shares in the home appliance maker at just 5.4 times estimated 2022 earnings.With the sell-side anticipating only a modest drop in EPS (from $2.10 to $1.75), investors could in time realize it was a mistake to send this stock down to the low-teens per share. Even if Hamilton Beach reports anemic growth from here, a valuation much higher than today’s multiple would be justified.Besides offering great value, HBB stock is a great opportunity for yield as well. Earning an A in Dividend Grader, the stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.69%. Hiking its quarterly dividend from 10 cents to 10.5 cents earlier this year, the coming years could bring additional modest payout increases.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a giant in the snack foods industry. Its portfolio of brands includes Cadbury, Oreo and Toblerone. Like other food stocks, shares have been hit hard by worries about the impact of inflationary pressure on its margins.Yet while inflation has put pressure on Mondelez’s performance, one analyst (Cowen’s Brian Holland) believes it’s been overdone. Furthermore, Holland argues the current valuation of MDLZ stock fails to reflect the company’s sales growth potential, as well as the potential for Mondelez to continue adding faster-growing brands to its portfolio, jettisoning the slower-growing ones.Trading for just 19.5 times earnings, there’s likely potential for multiple expansion if the market starts to agree with Holland’s arguments. In terms of its dividend, MDLZ stock earns an A in Dividend Grader. MDLZ stock has a 2.72% forward yield, and a 5-year track record of double-digit dividend growth.Medifast (MED)a bowl of vegetables, a green apple, and a measuring tape sit on a wooden tableSource: ShutterstockBenefiting from both pandemic and post-pandemic trends, weight-loss company Medifast (NYSE:MED) has experienced a big increase in sales and profitability since 2020. This led to a big increase in the price of its shares.Over the past year and a half, however, the stock’s performance has reversed course in a big way. After sliding in price for around a year management slashed guidance as a result of the company’s growth deceleration. Shares plunged on the news.Yet while the boom times may be over for now with Medifast’s business, there may be considerable upside for investors buying MED stock today.Shares trade for only 12 times estimated earnings, estimates that already account for the change in outlook. MED stock’s big drop has also made shares (earning an A in Dividend Grader) high-yielding. MED currently pays out $6.56 per share in dividends annually (6% forward yield).Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comTrends in 2021, including supply chain disruptions and the housing boom, were very favorable to Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).This year, however, the trends are clearly not in its favor. The appliance maker’s shares have been slammed, as inflation puts pressure on its margins, and rising interest rates/the economic slowdown curb demand.Still, while the company is feeling the squeeze, these headwinds may already be reflected in the price of WHR stock. Shares trade for only 6.2 times earnings estimates, providing plenty of buffer room if results fall far short of expectations. Whirlpool, earning an A in Dividend Grader, also remains a strong dividend stock.WHR stock has a forward yield of 5.09%. The company has raised its dividend eleven years in a row, with the dividend increases averaging 9.63% over the past five years. Whirlpool’s payout ratio (26.14%) leaves plenty more room for dividend growth.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ADM, COST and MDLZ.

(Nasdaq: SNPS) today announced the breakthrough golden signoff ECO solution that addresses lengthy engineering design closure times. The Synopsys PrimeClosure solution combines Synopsys' leading engineering change order (ECO) signoff solutions, Synopsys PrimeECO™ and Synopsys Tweaker™ ECO, with breakthrough innovations, delivering the fastest ECO closure times with high capacity and golden Synopsys PrimeTime® signoff accuracy. Early customers have achieved up to 45% better timing, up to 10% better power, up to 50% fewer ECO iterations and up to 10x higher design productivity compared to traditional ECO flows.""Given our focus on large-scale, advanced-node designs in areas such as automotive, data centers, networking and smart devices, fast turnaround time on ECOs is essential to our business success,"" said Kenta Sokawa, general manager, Back End Development Division, Global Development Group at Socionext. ""The Synopsys PrimeClosure solution reduced our turnaround time by over 5x, used 3x less machine memory and required 5x fewer machine resources. The early results are impressive, and we are excited to collaborate with Synopsys to push the envelope on conventional ECO challenges with the aim of achieving over 10x design closure productivity improvement for our large designs.""The Synopsys PrimeClosure solution is available to early adopters now with general availability targeted for December 2022. For more information, visit: https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/signoff/primeclosure.html. Accelerating Design ConvergenceApplication areas like data centers, mobile, automotive, AI and IoT are demanding aggressive PPA targets. Advanced process nodes bring new physical rules and introduce new effects which impact PPA. The enormous size and complexity of deep-submicron designs means that every analysis and ECO optimization run to fix issues takes longer and consumes more compute resources. Handling this large number of violations and driving convergence to reduce it to zero is a big part of the ECO challenge.Story continuesThe Synopsys PrimeClosure solution, with its innovative surgical optimization feature, improves design metrics like PPA, timing, clock network, voltage drop, variation and aging. The solution is tightly integrated with Synopsys Fusion Compiler™ RTL-to-GDSII solution and Synopsys PrimeTime static timing analysis solution for golden signoff accuracy, delivering a full flow that accelerates design convergence and time-to-market of large designs.With its novel gigachip hierarchical technology, the Synopsys PrimeClosure solution seamlessly scales designs with billion+ instances and hundreds of scenarios with a relatively small number of machines to deliver the industry's fastest turnaround time (TAT). Its optimized pruning technology efficiently sifts through thousands of scenarios and hundreds of hierarchical blocks to reduce the number of datasets for optimization, resulting in TAT speedup by over 40% and reduced memory by up to 60%.Optimizing Last-Mile Advanced Chip Design Closure Last-mile design optimization is critical to achieve optimal PPA. The Synopsys PrimeClosure solution has direct access to incrementally enabled placement, routing, extraction, physical verification, equivalence checking and signoff technologies from the market-leading Synopsys Digital Design Family. The Synopsys PrimeClosure solution is integrated with Ansys RedHawk-SC digital power integrity signoff solution, enabling a breakthrough automated late-stage golden signoff timing-aware ECO solution to accurately account for and fix up to 50% of late-stage dynamic voltage drop violations and maximize energy efficiency without impacting chip timing. The single-environment design closure cockpit ensures every change is fully implemented and validated and creates new opportunities for placement, routing, and timing co-optimization to achieve PPA results previously impossible in traditional design closure flows.""Scaling productivity in hyperconvergent designs requires innovative solutions that can quickly and efficiently optimize PPA targets in very large design spaces,"" said Jacob Avidan, senior vice president of Engineering for the Silicon Realization Group at Synopsys. ""The Synopsys PrimeClosure product provides the industry with a breakthrough golden signoff ECO solution that enables designers to confidently achieve the fastest path to design closure, so companies can do more in significantly less time.""About SynopsysSynopsys, Inc.

However, with the effect of the pandemic waning and widespread vaccination drives, this industry is on its pathway to recovery.As a result, lodging real estate investment trusts (REITs) are experiencing a rise in demand for their properties, with leisure travel to drive-in destinations increasing. Also, business transient and group demand in the urban markets have been improving.Notably, REITs like Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. HST, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB and Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. PK have started witnessing an improvement in their operating trend, with most metrics nearing or surpassing the pre-pandemic levels.In the second quarter of 2022, Host Hotels’ all-owned-hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) of $219.3 million almost doubled from the prior-year quarter’s $110.7 million. It was also the first time since the onset of the pandemic that the company’s quarterly RevPAR exceeded the 2019 levels.HST’s all-owned-hotel average occupancy percentage in the second quarter remained strong at 73.9%, rising from the prior-year quarter’s 44.9%. Further, average occupancy was close to 81.8% recorded in second-quarter 2019.Pebblebrook, too, has been benefiting from the recovery in travel demand. Per the company’s recent operating update, its estimated operating results for August, despite a normal back-to-school seasonality, were in line with its expectations owing to the recovery in business demand and strong rate premiums.With many companies implementing a return-to-office policy, business transient and group demand have picked pace. Per PEB’s latest operating update, face-to-face meetings are receiving a boost, and companies are actively booking their business travel for the remainder of 2022. However, the demand for this segment is yet to reach the pre-pandemic levels.As restrictions started declining across the United States, Park Hotels, too, started experiencing improvement in demand from mid-February 2022, with its urban hotels witnessing a return in business travel and group demand.In June 2022, group bookings for PK’s properties for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 continued to gain, with the addition of around 100,000 room nights compared with May 2022.Per Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., chairman and CEO of PK, “Leisure demand remains strong in our Hawaii, Florida and Puerto Rico markets, while business transient and group demand continue to strengthen, helping to drive average rates at our urban hotels above 2019 levels by over 2% and group rates to 2019 levels during the second quarter.”Further, we anticipate that the upcoming holiday season will be a catalyst for lodging REITs like HST, PEB and PK.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AZUL has been seeing a steady rebound in the air-travel demand, particularly in its domestic markets. Mainly owing to this improvement in domestic demand, consolidated traffic and capacity increased 63.8% and 59.6%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2022 from the comparable year-ago period levels.Azul’s domestic traffic and capacity increased 50% and 51.6% in the June quarter on a year-over-year basis. The company’s international traffic and capacity surged more than 100% in the June quarter on a year-over-year basis.With more people taking to the skies, Azul’s passenger revenues, contributing 90.7% to the top line, surged 151% year over year (on higher total capacity) in second-quarter 2022. The surge was driven by a 59.6% higher total capacity.The robust growth in e-commerce is boosting revenues at Azul’s cargo business unit. With e-commerce growth continuing in second-quarter 2022, cargo and other revenues rose 28.6% year over year, primarily owing to upbeat demand for Azul’s logistics solutions.However, the company’s total operating expenses surged 80.2% in second-quarter 2022 from its year-ago levels. Majorly, aircraft fuel rose 178.7% in this segment. Such escalating operating expenses might hurt the bottom-line results.Some other companies from the same space facing higher fuel costs include Southwest Airlines Co. LUV and Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE. The current scenario of rising fuel costs does not bode well for the airline and is hurting its bottom line.In second-quarter 2022, Southwest Airlines witnessed fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) of $3.36, which surged 75% year over year.For Spirit Airlines, the average fuel cost per gallon in the June quarter surged 120% year over year to $4.30. The fuel price per gallon is anticipated in the range of $3.55-$3.60 in the third quarter of 2022.

However, it only increased their shares held by 1.4%, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either. View our latest analysis for Simon Property Group Simon Property Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by J. Smith was the biggest purchase of Simon Property Group shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$95.77 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Simon Property Group insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months Simon Property Group insiders were buying shares, but not selling. Their average price was about US$110. This is nice to see since it implies that insiders might see value around current prices.

An agreement could come by the end of the week, the Nikkei newspaper reported late Wednesday.Shares of Rakuten jumped as much as 9.5% on Thursday morning in Tokyo, the biggest intraday gain since May 13, paring this year’s decline to 39%. Mizuho, Japan’s third-largest bank, rose 0.2%.Billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani’s Rakuten has struggled since it made a big push into Japan’s saturated mobile market to compete with NTT Docomo Inc., KDDI Corp. and SoftBank Corp. The group’s quarterly operating loss widened from a year ago, and S&amp;P Global Ratings last month gave it a negative credit outlook, citing cash pressures.A stake purchase of the size and price reported could boost Rakuten Securities’ sum-of-the-parts value by 8% to about 4.2 trillion yen, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts including Marvin Lo and Shin Tamura. The price implies a “hefty” price-to-book ratio of almost three times, versus 1.2 times for rival Monex Group Inc., they wrote in a note.Rakuten said in May that it’s preparing a listing for its securities unit as the e-commerce giant diversifies its business. It’s not clear what Mizuho’s stake purchase would mean for the initial public offering, which hasn’t been scheduled.Conditions for IPOs have deteriorated this year as investors get spooked by a global stock market slump. Rakuten is also planning to list its banking unit, and chose Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. as lead managers for the offering last month.Story continuesGoing OnlineJapan’s biggest banks have been struggling to build scale in their online securities businesses and compete with industry leaders like SBI Holdings Inc. and Rakuten. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. in June agreed to take a 10% stake in SBI, the country’s largest online brokerage.“Mizuho Securities is likely to be attracted by the growth in Rakuten’s online accounts (40%) and assets under management (54%), the highest pace of all Japanese brokers in fiscal 2022,” the BI analysts said.Mizuho and Rakuten are in talks for various alliance opportunities, including investment in Rakuten Securities, but nothing has been decided, the bank said in a statement. Rakuten Group issued a similar statement.For Japanese banks, digital channels are seen as critical to attract retail clients, especially younger generations.

With Mastercard’s solution, Android smartphones can double up as reliable payment acceptance devices for contactless cards, mobile wallets and smartwatches. Moreover, the smartphones acting as a physical point of sale require no added equipment or set-up expenses.If customers choose to pay through the PayContactless solution, they need to only touch a contactless card or a wearable on the merchant’s device. However, a consumer will be required to input the bank card PIN (known only to the cardholder) on the merchant’s phone only if the transaction value surpasses the verification limit for contactless payment permissible to the customer.Both small businesses and their customers are likely to benefit from the adoption of this new solution. Small business units will gain from seamless card payment acceptance capabilities. Similarly, along with businesses, consumers will be aided by a speedier and more secure checkout experience at stores.The latest partnership reflects Mastercard’s longstanding endeavor of infusing advanced digital solutions into the global payments landscape, thus bringing in more people and businesses under the ambit of a booming digital economy. As mobile phones become integral to our lives as a handy gadget, the MA solution that turns smartphones into payment acceptance devices seems to perfectly harness the teeming prospects in the worldwide digital payments space.Story continuesAlso, the expansion of Mastercard’s Tap on Phone solution throughout Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to strengthen its presence in the region that continues to witness a widespread uptake of digital technologies.The help extended by Mastercard to small businesses via the latest initiative is aptly timed. In an evolving digital era wherein businesses were compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, micro and small businesses grappled with inadequate resources and financial uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To bail such businesses out of crisis, Mastercard steadfastly partnered numerous well-established organizations, delivering several innovative digital payment solutions and pursuing significant investments.Like Mastercard, other companies making concerted efforts to cushion small businesses include American Express Company AXP, Visa Inc.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.12%.Heading into today, shares of the medical device maker had lost 1.42% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's loss of 0.3% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.29% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Hologic as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 31, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Hologic to post earnings of $0.62 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 61.49%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $866.83 million, down 34.16% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Hologic. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Go over the fund’s top 5 positions to have a glimpse of its finest picks for 2022.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, IP Capital Partners mentioned Netflix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:""Netflix was the top performance detractor for the year. After a brutal growth acceleration throughout 2020, followed by an expected moderation throughout 2021, 2022 was an important year to define whether the company would be able to maintain an extremely consistent historical growth trend until then.Among the 37 million subscribers added in 2020 – boosted by the lockdown – and the 18 million added in 2021, the company added an average of 27 million subscribers in the last two years, a number practically equal to the 29 and 28 million subscribers that Netflix added, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.Considering, also, that the 8.3 million subscribers added in the last quarter of 2021 were equivalent to the equivalent quarters of the previous three years [ 2 ] , it seemed reasonable to us to assume that the anticipation of demand caused by the pandemic in 2020 had reversed throughout 2021, bringing together the conditions for a more normalized growth in 2022.

Phillips 66 (PSX), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This oil refiner has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 15.07%.For the most recent quarter, Phillips 66 was expected to post earnings of $5.92 per share, but it reported $6.77 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.36%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.14 per share, while it actually produced $1.32 per share, a surprise of 15.79%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Phillips 66. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Phillips 66 currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.89%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 1, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

""Epirus' culture of innovation and GD's decades-long track record of delivering cutting-edge solutions will only continue as we work together to develop further capabilities.""Story continuesLeonidas' counter-swarm effectiveness fills a pressing short range air defense (SHORAD) capability gap for the joint force as the threat of swarming drones continues to endanger troops and civilians overseas and in the homeland.The continued evolution of adversaries' swarming drone capabilities is matched by Epirus' software-weaponeering capabilities, which allows the system to continually intake new data, rapidly update its sophisticated waveforms and expand its magazine depth for enhanced SHORAD mission assurance across all domains. With its open architecture, Leonidas can integrate with a range of Command-and-Control (C2) platforms to detect, track and defeat the increasing deployment of drone technology by adversaries and non-state actors.""Adding Leonidas' counter-electronics capabilities to the Stryker combat vehicle provides the joint force with unmatched mobile protection from the continuously evolving threat of weaponized drones,"" said Gordon Stein, Vice President of U.S. Operations at General Dynamics Land Systems. ""As the Army's largest combat vehicle fleet, Stryker is combat-proven, cost-effective, highly mobile, versatile, sustainable and transportable and continues to be a highly sought platform beyond the Stryker Brigade Combat Team formations.""Stryker Leonidas is the latest edition to Epirus' suite of HPM systems – along with the company's ground-based Leonidas system for surface-to-air defense and Leonidas Pod, a first-of-its kind, mobile and compact HPM system.

Oct. 5, NBC News reported. It comes during an especially vulnerable period for the global oil supply, which has been weakened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as by ongoing supply chain problems.Industry researcher Capital Economics estimates that global oil prices will rise to about $100 a barrel from $93 currently, NBC News noted. U.S. benchmark prices are expected to climb to $92 a barrel from $88.The national average price of gasoline in the United States was $3.867 a gallon as of Oct. 6. That’s up from $3.782 a week ago and $3.779 a month ago but still well down from the all-time high of $5.016 set on June 14, 2022.Claudio Galimberti, head of Americas analysis at Rystad Energy, said U.S. gas prices could increase by about 10% in much of the country, The Washington Post reported. But a lot depends on how other market factors play out.“The intention of the OPEC Plus cut was to break the fall in crude prices since the summer,” Bob McNally, an energy analyst at the Rapidan Energy Group, told the WaPo. “If they succeed, then gasoline pump prices should also stop falling and range around current levels, until other market drivers impact the price.”Gas prices will likely be impacted more in some regions of the country than others.“The regional differences in gas prices are stark at the moment, with prices on the West Coast hitting $6 a gallon and higher, while Texas and Gulf Coast states have prices dipping below $3 in some areas,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a Mon., Oct. 3 news release.He noted that at least six California refineries are undergoing maintenance, and “there is limited pipeline supply to the West Coast from locations east of the Rockies.”Story continuesThe Biden administration — which has put a high priority on bringing gas prices down ahead of the 2022 midterm elections — was quick to lash out at OPEC’s decision. As the WaPo reported, administration officials have pressured OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to produce more oil to compensate for the global shortage caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Biden himself even visited Saudi leaders during a trip to Jiddah.“The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC Plus to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,” U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said in a joint statement.The White House does have a couple of options to help offset OPEC’s move. One is to tap into the U.S.’s strategic petroleum reserve, which it has already done this year. Another is to lobby hard for passage of the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels bill, which would penalize other oil-producing countries by opening them up to antitrust suits.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?Discover: How Will Hurricane Ian Affect the Economy?The non-partisan NOPEC bill was sponsored by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and passed 17-4 in the Senate Judiciary Committee back in May, Reuters reported.

Analysts called the decision a political blow against the president.The White House is concerned the cuts could drive up gasoline prices for American drivers ahead of the midterm elections, and could give Russia's battered economy a boost. It called the OPEC+ move ""shortsighted"", and one US official said the administration was ""having a spasm and panicking,"" CNN reported.""It's clear that OPEC+ is aligning with Russia with today's announcement,"" White House spokesperson Karin Jean-Pierre said, per media reports. The White House did not immediately respond to an Insider request for comment.Many analysts say OPEC+ is more focused on bolstering crude prices, which have trended lower in recent months thanks to worries a looming global recession could hit demand for oil.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark price, were down slightly at $93.27 a barrel early Thursday, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were also edging lower at $87.63 a barrel.It's not clear how much oil could enter the market if the deal goes through, as Venezuela's oil industry has been hurt by underinvestment and mismanagement, OANDA analyst Craig Erlam told Insider.Story continuesThe amount could be substantial, he said, pointing to a US-led effort to limit the price paid for Russian oil and oil products.""Any deal could provide some relief in the market at a time when a price cap on Russian crude threatens its output levels and OPEC+ is intent on squeezing the market,"" he said.The proposed deal between the US and Venezuela would ease the sanctions in return for political concessions from President Nicolás Maduro's government, the WSJ reported. His regime would need to rekindle suspended talks with its political opposition about free and fair presidential elections, it said.But US officials warned the deal could still fall through, if Maduro's government doesn't follow through.In addition, the White House said it has no plans to change its policy on sanctions against Venezuela without ""constructive steps"" by the country's regime, Reuters reported.""Our sanctions policy on Venezuela remains unchanged. We will continue to implement and enforce our Venezuela sanctions,"" Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement to Reuters.Talks between the US and Venezuela on easing sanctions, begun by the Trump administration in 2019, have been in progress since Russia invaded Ukraine as the US looked to secure new sources of energy. Both countries held their first high-level bilateral talks in years on March 5. which involved discussions on a temporary easing.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

(NYSE:ZTS) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 34.6x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Zoetis has been relatively sluggish. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Zoetis will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Zoetis would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 10% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 56% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 12% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Zoetis' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Zoetis' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Zoetis that you need to take into consideration.You might be able to find a better investment than Zoetis.

102,fb543c37-ff99-3af5-b1e5-f684d5252b39,NEE,2022-10-06,Buy these 3 Energy Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-3-energy-stocks-001812682.html,1665015492,STORY,"['NEE', 'DVN']","[Many energy stocks had quite an amazing run over the last two years as oil and energy prices rebounded off their covid-induced lows.Crude Oil prices have climbed back to around $87 a barrel but are still well off their highs of $123.70 and the average closing price of $98.24 this year.While oil prices were bound for a correction, Oil and Energy is still the top-rated Zacks Sector, which might leave some investors wondering what to do with energy stocks.Let’s take a look at three top rated energy stocks for a better answer. Devon Energy DVNDevon Energy is an independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas.DVN’s stock has become increasingly popular over the last year because of the special dividend it has been paying while business booms. For the current quarter, DVN announced an extra dividend payment of $1.37 a share to go along with its regular $0.18 a share dividend.DVN currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its Oil and Gas–Exploration and Production Industry in the top 9% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Devon Energy’s earnings are expected to climb an impressive 162% to $9.24 a share in 2022, based on Zacks estimates. Fiscal 2023 calls for another 14% earning growth. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to jump 66% this year and another 1% in FY23 to $20.15 billion. DVN is up +60% year to date to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -21% and outperform its Zacks Subindustry and peer group at +43% and +48%, respectively. Even better, after the turnaround in oil prices, DVN is up +627% in the past two years to blast away the benchmark’s +13%. DVN has become an industry leader over the past two years as it also crushed its peer group’s stellar performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDevon Energy currently trades around $70 a share and roughly 10% off its 52-week highs. DVN has a forward P/E of 7.4X. This is slightly above the industry average of 5X but DVN’s earnings growth has solidified the company as an industry leader. Plus, it’s trading well below its high of 33.5X over the last two years and the median of 9.7X. This makes DVN attractive at current levels considering its performance during this time span.Story continuesNextEra Energy NEE Another Energy stock that is well known for its dividend is NextEra Energy (NEE). NEE is considered a Dividend Aristocrat after raising its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. NextEra Energy is a public utility company engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. NextEra has a good mix of solar and wind renewable energy capabilities as well.Investors may want to consider NEE stock because the company is not directly affected by the price of oil. However, as part of the Utilities sector, NEE is still poised to benefit from energy consumption. NEE’s Utility-Electric Power industry is also in the top 36% of 251 Zacks Industries.NextEra Energy is down -12% in 2022, but rising estimate revisions for this year and FY23 make the stock worth a look. NEE has a forward P/E of 28.6X, which is above the industry average of 17.7X. But from the nearby chart, we can see that NEE trades below its decade high of 36.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt is important to note that NEE is up +373% over the last 10 years, to crush the S&amp;P 500’s +174%. This has also blasted its Utility-Electric Power Markets +36%. This year’s dip in NEE may be a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.NEE earnings are expected to be up 13% this year and another 8% in FY23 at $3.13 a share. Sales are expected to rise 18% in 2022 and climb another 31% next year to $26.47 billion.NEE’s growth and reliable dividend are reasons investors may want to consider buying the stock. NEE has a 2.05% dividend yield at $1.70 a share. While its yield is lower than the industry average, investors can rely on the company to keep its dividend steady during high inflationary periods. NEE currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the average Zacks Price Target offers 16% upside from current levels.Schlumberger SLBSchlumberger (SLB) currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Schlumberger is a leading oilfield services company, providing services to oil and gas explorers, and producers across the world.Schlumberger helps locate oil and gas, drill, and evaluate hydrocarbon wells. SLB’s Oil and Gas-Field Services Industry is also in the top 9%.SLB’s YTD performance has been stellar at +39% to crush the benchmark and its peer group’s +9%. Even better, SLB is up +166% over the last two years to outperform the benchmark’s +13% and its peer group’s +116%. And the average Zacks Price Target offers 22% upside from its current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom its price performance, Schlumberger appears to be an industry leader, with its peer group consisting of other quality companies like Haliburton HAL and Baker Hughes BKR.This looks set to continue with earnings expected to climb 58% this year and another 37% in FY23 at $2.77 a share. Top line growth is expected to continue as well, with sales up 19% in 2022 and another 14% in FY23 to $31.24 billion.Trading around $41 a share, SLB has a forward P/E of 19.4X. This is near the industry average of 18.7X and well below its high of 36.7X over the last two years. SLB also trades below the median of 24.2X during this time span. Even better, SLB trades at an even bigger discount to its 10-year high of 152.5X. and the median of 24.9X.Bottom LineMany of the Industry leaders in the Oil and Gas Sector and the Utilities sector are still experiencing growth and offer generous dividends. These stocks can also help a portfolio during the current economic downturn and rising inflation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, both FirstEnergy and NextEra Energy are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.08, while NEE has a forward P/E of 28.67. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.40. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.97.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 1.97. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.65.Based on these metrics and many more, FE holds a Value grade of B, while NEE has a Value grade of D.Both FE and NEE are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that FE is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,9fb4696d-d21b-304f-88e3-cfd8005d4404,NEE,2022-10-06,Dominion (D) Gains From Investment and Its Renewable Focus,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dominion-d-gains-investment-renewable-141002840.html,1664979002,STORY,"['D', 'NEE']","[Dominion Energy D has been gaining from steady investments in regulated infrastructure, contribution from inorganic assets and the addition of clean sources to the production portfolio to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.Its earnings surpassed estimates in the last four quarters, with an average of 0.97%. Its long-term (three to five year) earnings growth is projected at 6.4%.TailwindsThe company plans to invest $73 billion to strengthen its infrastructure and add more clean power-generation assets to its portfolio in the 2022-2035 period. Through its portfolio-realignment strategy, the company is focusing on regulated assets, which is evident from its investments in regulated infrastructure and other fields whose outputs are sold under long-term purchase agreements (PPAs).Dominion Energy is in the process of adding 4,000 megawatts (MW) of solar or wind generation in the state of Virginia. Its long-term objective is to add 24 gigawatts (GW) of battery storage, solar, hydro and wind (offshore as well as onshore) projects by 2036 as well as increase renewable energy capacity by more than 15% per year, on average, over the next 15 years.The company aims to cut emissions by 70-80% and attain net-zero emissions of carbon and methane from its electricity generation and natural gas infrastructure by 2050 from the 2005 levels.Dominion Energy has plans to upgrade its electricity infrastructure by installing smart meters and grid devices, as well as enhance services to customers through the customer information platform. The company is also working on a project of strategic undergrounding of 4,000 miles of distribution lines.The company has already completed undergrounding 1,300 miles of outage-prone overhead power distribution lines in Virginia. These initiatives will increase the resilience of its operation and enable it to serve the expanding customer base more efficiently and boost its profits.HeadwindsDominion Energy is exposed to risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities and unplanned outages at power stations in which the company has an ownership interest. This might derail management’s planned production goal and adversely impact its earnings. Even if planned outages continue longer than the forecast period, it can adversely impact the company’s earnings.The Legal challenges resulting in the discontinuation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline will definitely impact the company’s long-term growth plans. The ongoing increase in interest rates will also increase the project’s cost-impacting margins.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other utilities in the same industry with well-chalked-out investment plans for strengthening their services are NextEra Energy NEE, American Electric Power Company, Inc. AEP and Exelon Corporation EXC.NextEra Energy aims to invest $85-$95 billion from 2022 through 2025 to strengthen its infrastructure. Courtesy of persistent renewable asset additions to its generation portfolio and execution across all business segments, NextEra Energy expects to witness a CAGR of more than 10% for earnings per share through 2025 from the 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.55. The long-term (three to five year) earnings growth of NextEra Energy is currently pegged at 9.66%.American Electric aims to invest approximately $24.8 billion in its transmission and distribution business during the 2022-2026 period to construct a more efficient grid and deliver custom energy solutions to customers.Such investments should enable AEP to make infrastructural upgrades in its transmission and distribution of utility services to resist adverse climate conditions and offer better facilities. Its long-term earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.11%.Exelon plans to invest nearly $29 billion during the 2022-2025 forecast period in regulated utility operations for grid modernization and to increase the resilience of its infrastructure to benefit customers.

Nationwide, the meat company has about 120,000 employees, with about 114,000 of them working in production plants.Tyson said it will begin a ""phased relocation"" of the corporate employees early next year and that the move will benefit collaboration and decision making. Members of the Tyson family, which founded Tyson Foods, and several top executives have long been based in Arkansas.A company spokesperson said no layoffs are associated with the relocations. It was not known how many office workers would make the move.A spokesperson for Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said Tyson ""is making decisions based on its unique corporate needs"" and growing in other parts of the state. Tyson said in August that an expansion project at a Caseyville, Illinois, plant will create 250 jobs.Still, Tyson's decision deals another blow to Chicago's business community after hedge fund Citadel said in June it was moving its global headquarters from the city to Miami. Boeing also said this year it would move its headquarters to Virginia from Chicago, and Caterpillar announced plans to relocate to Texas from a Chicago suburb.Kellogg, however, based the corporate headquarters for its largest business, snacks, in Chicago after announcing a split into three independent companies this summer.Tyson gained its Chicago office when it acquired Jimmy Dean sausage maker Hillshire Brands in 2014. It then ran its prepared foods business there.Last week, Tyson said Noelle O'Mara, who was group president of prepared foods, had left the job and would be replaced by Stewart Glendinning, who was chief financial officer.

Nationwide, the meat company has about 120,000 employees, with about 114,000 of them working in production plants.Tyson said it will begin a ""phased relocation"" of the corporate employees early next year and that the move will benefit collaboration and decision making. Members of the Tyson family, which founded Tyson Foods, and several top executives have long been based in Arkansas.A company spokesperson said no layoffs are associated with the relocations. It was not known how many office workers would make the move.A spokesperson for Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said Tyson ""is making decisions based on its unique corporate needs"" and growing in other parts of the state. Tyson said in August that an expansion project at a Caseyville, Illinois, plant will create 250 jobs.Still, Tyson's decision deals another blow to Chicago's business community after hedge fund Citadel said in June it was moving its global headquarters from the city to Miami. Boeing also said this year it would move its headquarters to Virginia from Chicago, and Caterpillar announced plans to relocate to Texas from a Chicago suburb.Kellogg, however, based the corporate headquarters for its largest business, snacks, in Chicago after announcing a split into three independent companies this summer.Tyson gained its Chicago office when it acquired Jimmy Dean sausage maker Hillshire Brands in 2014. It then ran its prepared foods business there.Last week, Tyson said Noelle O'Mara, who was group president of prepared foods, had left the job and would be replaced by Stewart Glendinning, who was chief financial officer.

With Mastercard’s solution, Android smartphones can double up as reliable payment acceptance devices for contactless cards, mobile wallets and smartwatches. Moreover, the smartphones acting as a physical point of sale require no added equipment or set-up expenses.If customers choose to pay through the PayContactless solution, they need to only touch a contactless card or a wearable on the merchant’s device. However, a consumer will be required to input the bank card PIN (known only to the cardholder) on the merchant’s phone only if the transaction value surpasses the verification limit for contactless payment permissible to the customer.Both small businesses and their customers are likely to benefit from the adoption of this new solution. Small business units will gain from seamless card payment acceptance capabilities. Similarly, along with businesses, consumers will be aided by a speedier and more secure checkout experience at stores.The latest partnership reflects Mastercard’s longstanding endeavor of infusing advanced digital solutions into the global payments landscape, thus bringing in more people and businesses under the ambit of a booming digital economy. As mobile phones become integral to our lives as a handy gadget, the MA solution that turns smartphones into payment acceptance devices seems to perfectly harness the teeming prospects in the worldwide digital payments space.Story continuesAlso, the expansion of Mastercard’s Tap on Phone solution throughout Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to strengthen its presence in the region that continues to witness a widespread uptake of digital technologies.The help extended by Mastercard to small businesses via the latest initiative is aptly timed. In an evolving digital era wherein businesses were compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, micro and small businesses grappled with inadequate resources and financial uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To bail such businesses out of crisis, Mastercard steadfastly partnered numerous well-established organizations, delivering several innovative digital payment solutions and pursuing significant investments.Like Mastercard, other companies making concerted efforts to cushion small businesses include American Express Company AXP, Visa Inc.

117,8ac9e3e6-c410-342c-961a-af3517503522,QCOM,2022-10-06,Is Causality the Missing Piece of the AI Puzzle?,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/causality-missing-piece-ai-puzzle-152000770.html,1664983200,STORY,['QCOM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 5, 2022 / At its core, science is all about finding causal relations. For example, it is not enough to know that smoking and cancer are correlated; what is important is to know that if we start or stop smoking, then that will change our probability of getting cancer.Machine learning (ML) as it exists today usually does not take causality into account, and instead is merely concerned with prediction based on statistical associations. This can lead to problems when using such models for decision making. For example, we may find a strong and statistically robust correlation between the chocolate consumption per capita, and the number of Nobel Prizes per capita but if we would use this model to inform policy (encouraging people to eat more chocolate), we would probably not obtain the desired result.Over the last few decades, computer scientists and statisticians have developed a comprehensive framework for causal inference that makes it possible (under certain circumstances) to infer causal relations from observational and experimental data, and more generally to do formal reasoning about cause and effect.These frameworks allow us to answer three kinds of questions.Associational: if I see X, what is the probability that I will see Y?Interventional: if I do X, what is the probability that I will see Y?Counterfactual: what would Y have been, had I done X?As we will discuss below, being able to answer such questions is very important in many AI tasks.Causal reasoning is also a key component of human intelligence. This is no surprise, because the main purpose of our brain is to decide how to act - a tree does not have a brain. Developmental psychologists have found that already at a young age, children develop the capacity to reason about cause and effect, and the causal models mentioned earlier give a fairly good description of human causal inferences.Since causal reasoning is key both to our scientific understanding of the world, and our common-sense understanding of it, it stands to reason that causal reasoning is also critical in the quest to build AI. At Qualcomm AI Research we are exploring various ways in which causal models can be used to solve long-standing fundamental open problems in AI and ML.Story continuesHow causality improves representation learningIn many learning problems, the input consists of low-level sensor data such as images from a camera. Learning how to act (e.g., to drive a car or control a robot) using only such low-level inputs is very challenging. The field of representation learning is concerned with training neural networks to turn such low-level inputs, consisting of millions of individually meaningless variables like pixels, into high-level semantically meaningful variables like the class and appearance of an object or its position.A common finding is that with the right representation, the problem becomes much easier. However, how to train the neural network to learn useful representations is still poorly understood. Here, causality can help. In causal representation learning, the problem of representation learning is framed as finding the causal variables, as well as the causal relations between them.The variables found using such methods tend to be much more interpretable. They also facilitate reasoning. For instance, an AI agent may reason that other cars on the road are driving slowly because they noticed that an ambulance is coming, even if we haven't seen it yet. In our paper, Weakly supervised causal representation learning, we study under which conditions we can learn the ""correct"" high-level representations - meaning the ones associated with the data-generating process. We also provide a simple proof-of-concept example where we learn a representation that disentangles various buttons and lights from visual input, and then figures out which buttons a robot arm should press to cause different lights to turn on.In addition to learning the causal variables and causal relations, we are working on methods that can learn how to intervene on the causal variables. For instance, for causal knowledge about buttons and lights to be useful, the robot needs to learn practical skills to actually press the button and link these skills to its reasoning capabilities.How causality improves imitation learningAnother area where causal inference can help is imitation learning. This is a class of methods where the AI agent is trained to imitate the actions of an expert. For example, we could collect video and LIDAR data, as well as steering and braking commands from expert human drivers, and train an AI agent to predict the actions of the expert when given the same video and LIDAR input.This approach is appealing because of its simplicity, but it can fail catastrophically if causality is not considered. One kind of problem has been dubbed causal confusion. Imagine that the visual input of our agent includes a small light on the dashboard, that turns on whenever the brake is pressed. The agent, lacking common sense, may discover that when the light is on, it is almost always the case that the action in the next time step (30fps) is to brake. Statistically, this is a correct inference, because most of the time when the expert is braking during one time step, they will do the same during the next time step. But causally speaking it is wrong: the expert was braking because of, for example, a dangerous situation or a stoplight, not because of a light on the dashboard. Clearly, if the imitator learns to keep braking whenever the brakes are pressed, and keep driving otherwise, then it will not do very well in the real world.Another problem occurs when the imitator fails to exactly imitate the expert. For example, if the imitator manages to be 99.9 percent accurate, it will still drift away from the trajectory of the expert driver over time. As a result, the imitator will find itself in a (potentially dangerous) situation it has not seen during training. Unless it can answer a counterfactual question, ""what would the expert have done had they been in this situation?"", the imitator will not know how to drive safely. In order to imitate properly, rather than ""monkey see monkey do""-type imitation, the imitator needs to understand why the expert chose the action they chose. And why questions are causal questions.A final problem occurs when the expert has access to more information than the imitator, which can lead to a problem known as confounding in the causality literature. For instance, imagine a robot learning to imitate an expert (who remotely controls the robot) at lifting coffee cups. If the expert knows the weight of the cup, they know how much force to apply to lift it. This can lead the imitator to infer that if the past actions applied a moderate amount of force, then the weight must be moderate, and hence at the next time step it is appropriate to apply a moderate force again. But of course, when it is not the expert but the agent performing the actions, the past actions do not contain information about the weight. Instead, in such circumstances, the imitator should employ exploratory behavior, for instance to first carefully gauge the weight of the cup. We can train such safe exploratory behaviors through a causality-aware imitation learning algorithm.How causality improves planning and credit assignmentTwo key problems in sequential decision-making problems are planning and credit assignment. In planning, the AI agent considers different sequences of actions and predicts their outcomes before deciding what to do next. To do this well, the agent needs to answer interventional questions: what would happen if I performed a certain action? Hence, the agent needs to have a causal model of its environment.Another problem is credit assignment. In many problems, the agent takes a long sequence of small actions before some desirable or undesirable outcome is reached. At that point, it is critical to know which of those actions actually caused the outcome, so that we can learn from this experience by changing (or not) the action that led to the observed outcome. At present, reinforcement learning agents still have a lot of difficulty with this, because they do not take causality into account explicitly.How causality improves robustness and distribution shiftCurrent ML models can be trained to predict extremely well in a controlled environment, but their performance can easily degrade when they are deployed in an environment that differs even a little bit from the training environment. A notorious example is a medical diagnosis model trained on medical images, where the data was obtained from two hospitals. In this case, hospital A had more serious cases of the disease in question, while hospital B had more mild cases. Furthermore, the two hospitals used different scanners to obtain the images, and one of them put a small logo in the corner of the image. This led the model to predict the severity based on the logo - a strategy that will clearly fail when applied in other hospitals with different scanners.A similar example that is often discussed is an image classifier that can label cows in an image. In the training data, cows were often seen standing on grass, and so the system takes the presence of grass to be evidence that the image contains a cow. When the system sees a cow on the beach at test time, it may fail to recognize it.In both cases, the ML model erroneously took some feature of the image to be the cause of the observed label. In order to avoid such problems, the system needs to understand the true causes of the label; to know why the human labeler chose the label they did. Only then can we hope to generalize to new settings; to build AI that can operate in a changing world.ConclusionCausal inference is not a magic bullet, and at this point it is not completely clear how to fruitfully combine the tools of causal inference with highly successful methods of deep learning. But as we have argued in this post, many of the fundamental open problems in AI are related to the issue of causality. For this reason, the causality and interactive learning team at Qualcomm AI Research is investigating ways to leverage these tools to solve long-standing open problems in AI, and address limitations of real-world AI systems.Sign up for our What's Next in Mobile Computing Tech newsletterQualcomm AI Research is an initiative of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.Qualcomm, Wednesday, October 5, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.qualcomm.com/company/sustainabilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719029/Is-Causality-the-Missing-Piece-of-the-AI-Puzzle]"

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether QUALCOMM's current trading price of US$122 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM What Is QUALCOMM Worth?Good news, investors! QUALCOMM is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 10.69x is currently well-below the industry average of 16.08x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, QUALCOMM’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of QUALCOMM look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of QUALCOMM, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 1.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since QCOM is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy QCOM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed assessment.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share, indicating a change of +23.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.47 points to a change of +46% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.74 indicates a change of +2.2% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $11.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.9%. The $44.17 billion and $46.6 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +31.6% and +5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $10.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.7%. EPS of $2.96 for the same period compares with $1.92 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.5%. The EPS surprise was +3.5%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the healthcare industry, go directly to 5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To Invest In.Healthcare is one of the biggest sectors in the world. According to a research report, the healthcare consumer market size was $332.391 billion and is expected to reach $667.37 billion by 2028. In 2020, the healthcare sector accounted for 19.7% of the US GDP and the healthcare expenditure was about $4.1 trillion or $12,530 per person. According to Deloitte, the US healthcare expenditure is expected to more than double to $8.3 trillion in 2040.In the past year, the healthcare services industry has gained 7.7%, and its earnings are expected to grow by 14% annually. However, as of October 3, the sector has declined by 1.3% in the last week. At the time of writing, the industry is trading at a 24.6x PE ratio compared to the 3-year average of 22.2x.When talking about healthcare stocks, large companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) steal the spotlight. However, in this article, we will discuss the cheap healthcare stocks in these times of inflation and global economic headwinds.Photo by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash Our MethodologyAfter a careful assessment of the healthcare sector, we picked these stocks based on their fundamentals, financial strength, analyst ratings, and dividend history. All of the stocks mentioned in the article are priced below $35 as of October 3.The hedge fund sentiment around some of the stocks has also been added which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds at the end of Q2 2022.11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To Invest In11. AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL)Price as of October 3: $10.25AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) is a Canadian biotechnology company that operates an AI-powered antibody discovery platform. As of the second quarter of 2022, 17 hedge funds had a stake in the company. Baker Bros. Advisors is the most prominent shareholder. The fund owned over 10.45 million shares, worth $111.29 million.Story continuesAbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) is one of the best health stocks due to its multiple revenue streams. The company generates revenues through optional investment shares,  licensing, milestone payments, and research fees. However, the largest revenue stream is generated through royalties from successful drugs. Currently, the company maintains approximately 74% gross margins and close to 40% net profit margins. Additionally, the mid-cap company holds $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt as of the latest June quarter.On August 10, Credit Suisse analyst Tiago Fauth maintained an Outperform rating on AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL)’s shares and lowered the price target to $34 from $40. The analyst mentioned that the company added six programs under contract and started discovery on an additional four, which brings up the cumulative program starts to 88.AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) is an affordable stock unlike expensive names like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).10. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG)Price as of October 3: $15.51Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) is a Dutch medical devices company. It operates through three segments; diagnosis and treatment, connected care, and personal health.Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) is one of the best healthcare stocks because of its strong focus on shareholder returns. The company pays dividends annually and as of October 3, the company has a yield of 5.88%. The next estimated dividend payout date is June 9, 2023. However, it has to be kept in mind that the Netherlands has a dividend withholding tax of 15% which lowers the dividend yield due to the dilution of shares as the shareholders prefer their dividends in form of shares rather than cash. Nonetheless, the company consistently repurchases its outstanding shares and has spent $5 billion on share repurchases since 2017.Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) is also a good addition to investor portfolios as it has penetrated a market with obstructed entrance. The company has only two other competitors and has steady subscription services for some of its products, generating some strong recurring revenues for the company.On September 12, Societe Generale analyst Delphine Le Louet upgraded Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) shares to Buy from Hold and lowered the price target to EUR 21 from EUR 22.40. The analyst believes that the company’s current share price “more than discounts the bad news.”Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“In the health care sector, our biggest detractor was Philips. Philips was a Q3 purchase. After exiting more consumer-focused businesses such as TV and lighting over the past decade, Philips has become a health care technology company operating across three main areas: diagnosis and treatment, connected care, and personal health. Shares came under pressure due to a recall of its first-generation CPAP machine for sleep apnea and fears regarding potential litigation. This created our opportunity to get involved. However, following our initial purchase, shares fell further in November after the FDA provided an update on the device recall and delineated deficiencies identified from an inspection of the device’s main manufacturing facility, which in itself is not unusual. Investors’ key sources of concern likely center around the recall expanding to additional products, the potential for legal recourse, and potential market share losses arising in the sleep division. Nonetheless, the sleep division is a small part of the overall business—which we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues.

This was one of the key topics up for discussion on CBS News' 60 Minutes with President Joe Biden. The President responded to Scott Pelley's comments on the inflation rate by explaining that the rate itself has continued to stay even while the government is trying to create more jobs for the people. The new administration has created 10 million new jobs since Biden has come into the Oval office, and has brought the unemployment rate down to about 3.7%. On the stock market, Biden is confident that massive investments in the computer chips sector in particular are going to help the market recover from its current fall as well.While the new government is trying its best to grow new industries and help existing ones survive, Biden's recent interview with CBS has led to the healthcare sector plummeting. By commenting that ""the pandemic is over,"" the President set in motion the fall of major vaccine-making companies, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) fell by 1.3% right after the interview was broadcasted, while Moderna, Inc.

The company's shares were down by over 20% in mid-January. About $133 billion were wiped from the company's market capitalization by this January. Moderna, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRNA) downfall was further exacerbated by the inefficacy of its COVID-19 booster against the Omicron variant which rapidly spread across the globe at the start of this year. Regardless, Biden is confident that the worst of the pandemic has passed, and the health of the people is being restored slowly but surely. In such circumstances, it is becoming crucial to keep a sharp eye on healthcare stocks, especially vaccine-makers with large COVID-19 franchises, as they are definitely set to suffer in the coming months.Story continues10 Healthcare Stocks to Watch in Light of Biden's 60 Minutes InterviewLet's now take a look at the 10 healthcare stocks to watch in light of Biden's 60 Minutes interview.Our MethodologyWe have selected healthcare stocks that fell after President Biden's comments on 60 Minutes stating that the pandemic was over.

132,a75f1b70-a33a-3ef4-acc2-6fc359c59632,MDT,2022-10-06,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Medtronic PLC (MDT) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-medtronic-plc-130001108.html,1664974801,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic (MDT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this medical device company have returned -2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Medtronic falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Medtronic is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share, indicating a change of -3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.53 points to a change of -0.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 indicates a change of +5.5% from what Medtronic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Medtronic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MDT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Medtronic, the consensus sales estimate of $7.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.6%. The $31.56 billion and $32.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.4% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMedtronic reported revenues of $7.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.7%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +0.89%.Over the last four quarters, Medtronic surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Medtronic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Medtronic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Tower AMT, SBA Communications SBAC and Crown Castle Inc. CCIHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Tower REITs Seek Expansion Opportunities on Solid DemandTower real estate investment trusts (REITs) like American Tower, SBA Communications and Crown Castle Inc. are well-poised to benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers. This is due to the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally.Moreover, wireless connectivity usage has significantly increased owing to the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet of Things. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have aided the rise.This has resulted in wireless service providers and carriers expanding their networks and deploying additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity to meet the rising consumer demand.Consequently, the tower leasing demand has increased tremendously. This is expected to fuel the top-line growth of tower REITs.Also, with the increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications, such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, wireless consumer demand is expected to escalate considerably.To capitalize on this upbeat trend, American Tower, SBA Communications and Crown Castle have been focusing on strategic acquisitions and development activities.Story continuesIn the second quarter, SBAC acquired 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil for total cash consideration of $127.3 million and built 100 towers. It is also under contract to acquire roughly 2,600 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Similarly, in 2021, AMT acquired Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, consisting of 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain. This provided the company with a significant scale in these attractive markets and enabled it to diversify its footprint with a strong, primarily tier-1, multinational tenant base.During the second quarter of 2022, AMT spent roughly $90 million on the acquisition of 118 communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets. These included 96 communications sites relating to its prior-announced agreement with Orange S.A. and fiber connected to its communications sites in Spain from Telefónica de España S.A.U.AMT's development plan also assumes the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites across its international footprint.CCI, too, expects to double the rate of small cell deployments next year compared with the 5,000 nodes it anticipates putting on air in 2022, as 5G deployment is expected to require a greater scale of small cell deployment to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network.Further, these REITs have solid balance-sheet strength with ample liquidity and financial flexibility. This supports their expansionary efforts to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Cabometyx generated sales of $641.97 million in the first half of 2022, up 29%.The capsule formulation of cabozantinib is approved as Cometriq for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).In addition, the pipeline progress has been impressive as the company strives to expand Cabometyx’s label and concurrently develop its portfolio beyond lead drug Cabometyx.Other candidates in Exelixis’ pipeline include XL092, a next-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); XB002, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that targets tissue factor (TF); XL102, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7); and XL114, a novel anti-cancer compound that inhibits the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex.Earlier this month, the company announced results from the dose-escalation stage of STELLAR-001, an ongoing phase Ib trial evaluating XL092 as a single-agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.Both single-agent XL092 and XL092 in combination with atezolizumab demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in a heavily pretreated patient population. XL092 demonstrated preliminary clinical activity similar to that observed with cabozantinib in phase I across a range of solid tumors and dose levels, with a manageable safety profile.  Based on the results, the 100 mg dose of XL092 was selected for the expansion phase, which is ongoing in a number of solid tumor types.Story continuesExelixis has also initiated the dose-escalation stage of the first-in-human phase I trial of XL114 as a monotherapy in patients with NHL who have received prior standard therapies.Meanwhile, the company is also forming strategic collaborations to strengthen its pipeline. In July, Exelixis entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ryvu Therapeutics to develop novel STING agonist-based targeted cancer therapies.In June, Exelixis and BioInvent entered into an option and license agreement focused on identifying and developing novel antibodies for use as oncology therapeutics. The collaboration is intended to expand Exelixis’ portfolio of antibody-based therapies.The successful development of additional drugs will broaden its portfolio and reduce its dependence on the lead drug Cabometyx.Competition is stiff in the RCC space, and capturing additional market share might become tough for Exelixis.Merck’s MRK Keytruda, in combination with Pfizer’s PFE Inlyta, is also indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC.Merck’s Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, is approved for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy or nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.Pfizer’s Inlyta has shown strong performance, driven by continued adoption in the United States and Europe. PFE’s older drug Sutent is also approved for advanced RCC.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

These candidates target oncology indications, which represent significant potential.The lead candidate in Iovance’s pipeline is lifileucel, which is being developed as a monotherapy for treating metastatic melanoma and metastatic cervical cancer in two mid-stage studies. The company started a rolling submission of the biologics license application (BLA), seeking approval for lifileucel in August 2022 for melanoma. The company is also developing combination therapies of lifileucel for other oncology indications.This BLA is supported by data from the pivotal cohort 4 of the phase II C-144-01 study, announced in May 2022, which evaluated lifileucel in heavily pre-treated melanoma patients. Participants who were treated with the drug achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 29%. This result was consistent with cohort 2 of the C-144-01 study, which achieved an ORR of 35%. Overall, data from both cohort 2 and cohort 4 showed that one-time treatment with lifileucel has the potential to provide meaningful benefits to heavily pre-treated patients.The BLA is also supported by positive feedback from the FDA on the potency assays and assay matrix issues for lifileucel as a potential treatment of melanoma, which the company received on Apr 1, 2022.The FDA’s feedback on potency assays and assay matrix was much needed for Iovance as management could not initiate regulatory filing for lifileucel in melanoma since the issue began in October 2020. As a result of this resolution, management can now proceed with plans for regulatory filings in other indications.Iovance plans to start a phase III study later this year to evaluate the combination of lifileucel and Merck’s MRK blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), as a potential treatment for immune checkpoint inhibitor naïve frontline metastatic melanoma. This late-stage study will be a confirmatory study for the pivotal Cohort 4 of the C-144-01 study.Story continuesThe novel combination of lifileucel and Merck’s Keytruda demonstrated a safe clinical profile. Iovance has also conducted several studies evaluating this combination across multiple solid tumor indications. The clinical studies have shown encouraging results in patients compared to treatments with either lifileucel or MRK’s Keytruda as monotherapies in study participants.Iovance is investigating LN-145 as a potential treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in separate mid-stage studies.Another ongoing phase II study, IOV-COM-202, which is composed of seven cohorts is evaluating Iovance’s TIL therapies in multiple settings and for several indications, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s Keytruda or Bristol-Myers’ BMY Opdivo/Yervoy.Opdivo and Yervoy are two of the many blockbuster drugs marketed by Bristol Myers and are key drivers of its top line. In first-half 2022, Bristol Myers generated nearly $3.99 billion from Opdivo sales and recorded $1.04 billion as product revenues from Yervoy.Iovance is also focused on expanding its pipeline beyond lifileucel and LN-145. Earlier this year, management announced that the FDA had accepted its regulatory filing to start clinical studies for its first TALEN-edited TIL therapy, IOV-4001. The company intends to start a phase I/II study later this year, evaluating this candidate in patients with advanced melanoma and metastatic NSCLC in two separate cohorts.IOV-4001 utilizes the TALEN technology licensed from Cellectis CLLS. This license is part of a collaboration finalized between Iovance and CLLS in 2020. Per the agreement terms, IOVA has an exclusive worldwide license to use Cellectis’ proprietary TALEN technology to develop gene-editing TIL therapies targeting cancer. In return, Cellectis will be entitled to receive milestones and royalty payments from Iovance upon potential development and successful commercialization of the products developed using the TALEN technology.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and Biden's insights, you can go directly to see the 5 Healthcare Stocks to Watch in Light of Biden's 60 Minutes Interview.On September 13, the annual inflation rate came in at 8.3%, marking the highest inflation rate the US has seen in 40 years. This was one of the key topics up for discussion on CBS News' 60 Minutes with President Joe Biden. The President responded to Scott Pelley's comments on the inflation rate by explaining that the rate itself has continued to stay even while the government is trying to create more jobs for the people. The new administration has created 10 million new jobs since Biden has come into the Oval office, and has brought the unemployment rate down to about 3.7%. On the stock market, Biden is confident that massive investments in the computer chips sector in particular are going to help the market recover from its current fall as well.While the new government is trying its best to grow new industries and help existing ones survive, Biden's recent interview with CBS has led to the healthcare sector plummeting. By commenting that ""the pandemic is over,"" the President set in motion the fall of major vaccine-making companies, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) fell by 1.3% right after the interview was broadcasted, while Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) fell by 7.1%.While the pandemic's end is a cause for celebration for all, vaccine-makers might not be too pleased with this publicity. According to a Forbes article, their reign began to end early this year, as Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) hit an eight-month low this January, falling 4.4% to $160. The company's shares were down by over 20% in mid-January. About $133 billion were wiped from the company's market capitalization by this January. Moderna, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRNA) downfall was further exacerbated by the inefficacy of its COVID-19 booster against the Omicron variant which rapidly spread across the globe at the start of this year. Regardless, Biden is confident that the worst of the pandemic has passed, and the health of the people is being restored slowly but surely. In such circumstances, it is becoming crucial to keep a sharp eye on healthcare stocks, especially vaccine-makers with large COVID-19 franchises, as they are definitely set to suffer in the coming months.Story continues10 Healthcare Stocks to Watch in Light of Biden's 60 Minutes InterviewLet's now take a look at the 10 healthcare stocks to watch in light of Biden's 60 Minutes interview.Our MethodologyWe have selected healthcare stocks that fell after President Biden's comments on 60 Minutes stating that the pandemic was over.

EME is well-poised for growth in the near term, given increased project activity within the commercial, manufacturing, healthcare and transportation sectors. Also, solid acquisition strategies have been broadening its foothold.Although supply chain issues and energy and raw material-related costs continue to suppress margins, strong demand across geographies and end markets served, as well as disciplined project execution are tailwinds.Let’s take a look at the factors supporting the growth.Solid Construction Activities: EMCOR and other construction companies, like Dycom Industries, Inc. DY, Quanta Services, Inc. PWR and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to aid EME.The U.S. Construction segment of the company has been maintaining strong momentum. The company’s major segments, primarily the U.S. Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments, continued to display significant strength. The trend continued in the first half of 2022.The RPOs at June-end were up 26.5% from the year-ago period’s levels. EMCOR continues to see demand for electrical and mechanical systems in new construction and retrofit projects.Within the U.S. Construction umbrella, the U.S. Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment revenues increased 14.6% year over year for the second quarter. The company benefited from increased project activity within the commercial (exclusive of the telecommunications submarket), manufacturing, healthcare and transportation markets.The U.S. Mechanical Construction and Facilities Services segment revenues rose 10.1% from the year-ago level. The upside was derived from the majority of the market served, with the water and wastewater, manufacturing and commercial market sector experiencing the most significant period-over-period increases.Strategic Acquisitions: The company is keen on the acquisition of assets and businesses. The company’s acquisition strategies focus on buying small private firms with proven management and expansion potential.During the first half of 2022, it acquired two companies that provide fire protection services in the Northeastern and Southern regions of the United States, respectively. Also, it acquired a company specializing in building automation and controls in the Southwestern region, within the United States building services segment.Meanwhile, on Aug 5, EME acquired a leading full-service electrical construction contractor, Gaston Electrical Co., LLC (formerly Gaston Electric Co., Inc.). Gaston — headquartered in Norwood, MA — designs, installs, constructs and maintains electrical and low-voltage systems in a wide variety of projects. The buyout will strengthen EMCOR’s specialty construction services operations in the Greater Boston area, with expected revenues of $140 million and remaining unsatisfied performance obligations of $120 million in 2022.Upbeat View: Resilient end markets, solid RPOs and bolt-on acquisitions are also gaining traction. The company expects strong project demand across key market sectors, favorable SG&amp;A leverage and a more normalized fall turnaround season for the U.S. Industrial Services segment in the near term.Given the solid visibility, EMCOR expects earnings per share within $7.30-$7.80 for 2022, narrower from the $7.15-$7.85 projected earlier. It anticipates revenues of approximately $10.8 billion (up from the prior projection of $10.4-$10.7 billion).Story continuesA Brief Discussion on the Above-Mentioned StocksDycom Industries is benefiting from the higher demand for network bandwidth and mobile broadband, extended geography, proficient program management and network planning services. Dycom expects considerable opportunities across a broad array of customers.Quanta Services remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on megatrends and opportunities to lead the energy transition and enable technological development, with initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure gaining momentum. More demand for infrastructure solutions that help support customers' energy-transition initiatives and modernization will continue to provide multi-year growth opportunities for Quanta.Sterling Infrastructure has been benefiting from broad-based growth across the e-infrastructure, building and transportation solutions segments.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is one of the younger hedge funds out there, as it was set up by Mr. Ed Bosek in 2010.The investor set up his hedge fund when he was 29, and like his peers in the hedge fund industry, he also spent time working in the industry before launching his own fund. Prior to setting up BeaconLight Capital, Mr. Bosek worked at the famed investment bank Deutsche Bank and at the European hedge fund Atticus. He grew up in New York's Staten Island and attended the Regis High School in Manhattan.When he was younger, the executive did not want to enter the financial world, and instead, he was more attracted to the medical profession. He enrolled in the illustrious University of Pennsylvania to become a doctor, and it was during this time at the university that he interacted with students from the Wharton School of Business. This led to a growing interest in finance and economics developing for Mr. Bosek, and he would go on to abandon his medical dreams and instead pursue a Master of Business Administration from Wharton as part of his undergraduate courses.After graduation, the executive moved to Europe for an internship with Deutsche Bank, and after initially accepting a full time offer, he decided to leave the investment bank and join the hedge fund world. During his search for the perfect fund, he would come to like the approach of Atticus Capital's founder Mr. Tim Barakett, and go on to join the fund's European team. Atticus' differences from traditional investment banks and larger hedge funds would attract Mr. Bosek, and he would go on to become the fourth member of the team.Story continuesDuring his time at Atticus, the now hedge fund executive would see the fund's portfolio grow from $1 billion to $22 billion in 2007. He left Atticus in 2009, stating that it was becoming harder to generate strong returns for large portfolio sizes. A year later, Mr. Bosek set up BeaconLight Capital with just $50 million in funds. His new hedge fund would focus intensely on research and develop an investment approach that is described as FMD. Short for ""fundamental, meaningful, and different"", 'fundamental' analyzes a business's underlying drivers, 'meaningful' estimates the sheer impact that a company can make through outperforming expectations, and 'different' emphasizes the fund's ability to take positions that others in the industry would balk at.This approach does seem to be yielding dividends, as, by the end of the second quarter of this year, BeaconLight Capital had a portfolio that was worth $215 million. The top picks in this portfolio are General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CCK), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG).10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Ed Bosek's BeaconLight CapitalOur Methodology We studied BeaconLight Capital's Q2 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sift out its top investment picks.

(NYSE:CVE): We continue to remain positive on the outlook for Energy. While a potential U.S. recession would result in softer oil demand, we believe this would be more than outweighed by China re-opening over the coming year (which would see a major lift in car and air traffic). Oil supply continues to remain constrained with sustained declines in global inventories and OPEC+ remains unable to grow production significantly. With the sell-off in energy stocks, MEG and Cenovus are currently generating more than 20% of their market cap in cash flow with large dividends and share buybacks to come.Cenovus Energy (Long +14%) shares rallied driven by continued strong free cash flow generation, as well as being positioned to benefit from strong refining margins and downstream operations. The company recently announced a significant increase in dividends, which gives us greater confidence on the potential for a 100% return of free cash flow generation via dividends and buybacks from early CY23. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate the company is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. At present, oil prices are more than double this break-even point, implying considerable upside to consensus cash flow estimates (if prices remain near current levels). There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.”7.

While the company has struggled to find its footing since being spun-out of Honeywell in 2018, we see early evidence that the new management’s long-term strategic vision is both achievable and not yet being embraced by investors.

When a pipeline is being decommissioned, repaired or inspected, natural gas must first be removed from the pressurized pipe. Before advances in cross-compression technology, small amounts of natural gas would be vented or flared into the atmosphere before the repair could be completed.By using innovative cross-compression technology like Zero Emissions Vacuum and Compressor, or ZEVAC, natural gas is captured during maintenance or inspection and recycled back into the pipeline system for continued use. This results in less gas or methane entering the atmosphere.""At VNG, our focus is on being good environmental stewards for a more sustainable future,"" said Robert Duvall, president of Virginia Natural Gas. ""It's more important than ever to make progress in sustainability efforts while contributing to nationwide and global environmental goals. The ability to capture methane before it is released with cross-compression technology will provide lasting and positive effects on our environment.""Now, using two ZEVAC machines purchased by the company, natural gas can be evacuated from one pipeline, with up to 99% transferred back into the pipeline system at a different location instead of being released into the atmosphere. A bonus is that the mobile units can fit in a standard truck cargo bed and are easily transported to worksites.Story continuesSo far in 2022, VNG has saved 42 mcf of natural gas not vented into the atmosphere, the equivalent of recycling 6.9 cubic tons of waste not taken to a landfill.""The use of cross-compression technology is helping VNG achieve our carbon reduction goals in a cost-effective and efficient way,"" added Duvall. ""ZEVAC is just one example of how we are using technology as part of our strategy to provide a clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy future for our customers and communities.""(Watch how Virginia Natural Gas and Southern Company Gas are utilizing cross compression technology https://youtu.be/3r-NOerllls.)About Virginia Natural Gas Virginia Natural Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO).

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Southern hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Southern peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Southern.Is There Enough Growth For Southern?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Southern would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 4.2% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 33% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 14% per annum over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Southern is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Southern's P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Southern's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Southern that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Southern's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this real estate investment trust is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 4.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 39.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 23%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Mid-America Apartment Communities have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineMid-America Apartment Communities has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Mid-America Apartment Communities well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.Cigna could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Cigna peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Cigna.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Cigna's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 27%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 53% in total over the last three years. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that Cigna's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Cigna's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Cigna that you should be aware of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Cigna, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Cigna (CI). CI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Investors should also note that CI holds a PEG ratio of 1.04. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CI's industry has an average PEG of 1.11 right now. Within the past year, CI's PEG has been as high as 1.07 and as low as 0.78, with a median of 0.96.We should also highlight that CI has a P/B ratio of 1.91. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. CI's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.04. Over the past 12 months, CI's P/B has been as high as 1.95 and as low as 1.34, with a median of 1.70.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. CI has a P/S ratio of 0.5. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.75.Story continuesAnother great Insurance - Multi line stock you could consider is Ping An Insurance Co. of China (PNGAY), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Ping An Insurance Co. of China sports a P/B ratio of 0.53 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.04.

Cabometyx generated sales of $641.97 million in the first half of 2022, up 29%.The capsule formulation of cabozantinib is approved as Cometriq for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).In addition, the pipeline progress has been impressive as the company strives to expand Cabometyx’s label and concurrently develop its portfolio beyond lead drug Cabometyx.Other candidates in Exelixis’ pipeline include XL092, a next-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); XB002, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that targets tissue factor (TF); XL102, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7); and XL114, a novel anti-cancer compound that inhibits the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex.Earlier this month, the company announced results from the dose-escalation stage of STELLAR-001, an ongoing phase Ib trial evaluating XL092 as a single-agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.Both single-agent XL092 and XL092 in combination with atezolizumab demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in a heavily pretreated patient population. XL092 demonstrated preliminary clinical activity similar to that observed with cabozantinib in phase I across a range of solid tumors and dose levels, with a manageable safety profile.  Based on the results, the 100 mg dose of XL092 was selected for the expansion phase, which is ongoing in a number of solid tumor types.Story continuesExelixis has also initiated the dose-escalation stage of the first-in-human phase I trial of XL114 as a monotherapy in patients with NHL who have received prior standard therapies.Meanwhile, the company is also forming strategic collaborations to strengthen its pipeline. In July, Exelixis entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ryvu Therapeutics to develop novel STING agonist-based targeted cancer therapies.In June, Exelixis and BioInvent entered into an option and license agreement focused on identifying and developing novel antibodies for use as oncology therapeutics. The collaboration is intended to expand Exelixis’ portfolio of antibody-based therapies.The successful development of additional drugs will broaden its portfolio and reduce its dependence on the lead drug Cabometyx.Competition is stiff in the RCC space, and capturing additional market share might become tough for Exelixis.Merck’s MRK Keytruda, in combination with Pfizer’s PFE Inlyta, is also indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC.Merck’s Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, is approved for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy or nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.Pfizer’s Inlyta has shown strong performance, driven by continued adoption in the United States and Europe. PFE’s older drug Sutent is also approved for advanced RCC.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

172,bb72a45d-6fd2-3cd0-87f4-10789857e6c6,PFE,2022-10-06,GSK's Key Drugs to Drive Sales in a Sluggish Second Half,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gsks-key-drugs-drive-sales-131501077.html,1664975701,STORY,"['GSK', 'PFE', 'HLN']","[GSK’s GSK relatively newer specialty products like Nucala (severe eosinophilic asthma), Bexsero (meningitis vaccine), Shingrix (shingles vaccines), Trelegy Ellipta (three medicines in a single inhaler to treat COPD) and Juluca (dolutegravir+ rilpivirine once-daily, single pill for HIV) have witnessed considerable success and have become key drivers of top-line growth. Sales of these products are making up for a decline in Established Pharmaceuticals due to generic erosion.  GSK expects its new medicines and vaccines (approved between 2017 and 2021) to contribute around 60% of the new GSK’s (after CHC demerger) sales growth for the period 2022-2026.GSK has made significant progress in its pipeline. Promising candidates in late-stage development include momelotinib (myelofibrosis), otilimab (rheumatoid arthritis), gepotidacin (uncomplicated urinary tract infection and urogenital gonorrhoea), bepirovirsen (chronic hepatitis B), depemokimab (severe eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps) and RSV vaccines for older adults.Key new drug approvals in the past couple of years were Rukobia/fostemsavir for heavily pre-treated HIV, Blenrep/belantamab mafatotin for fourth-line multiple myeloma; Cabenuva, a long-acting injectable HIV treatment; Jemperli (dostarlimab) for second-line endometrial cancer and mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced solid tumors and Apretude, a long-acting injectable form of cabotegravir drug for the prevention of HIV infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. These new products should contribute meaningfully to revenue growth in coming years.In 2020/2021, GSK established multiple partnerships to develop COVID-19 solutions, including with Sanofi, Medicago, SK Biosciences to make adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine and with Vir Biotechnology VIR for therapeutic antibody treatments like Xevudy (sotrovimab). GSK/Vir Biotechnology’s Xevudy was authorized in the United States in May 2021 and Europe in December 2021. Xevudy generated sales of almost £1.78 billion for GSK in the first half of 2022. GSK is also increasing investment in the mRNA platform.Story continuesSeveral new drug/line extension approvals are expected in the near future, which should boost sales. GSK plans to launch more than 20 new products/line extensions by 2026, with more than 10 having blockbuster potential.In July, GSK completed the spin-off of its Consumer Healthcare segment into a new standalone company called Haleon HLN. GSK’’s Consumer Healthcare segment was a joint venture with Pfizer PFE formed by the merger of their respective Consumer Healthcare units in 2019. GSK shareholders own 54.5% stake in Haleon, while 6% is held by GSK. Pfizer holds a 32% stake in Haleon and plans to sell this stake soon. The spin-off of the Consumer unit has allowed GSK to focus on its drug development.GSK’s vaccine sales recovered in 2022 after being hurt by COVID-related disruptions in several marketsin 2021.In 2022, the company expects vaccine sales to grow at low to mid-teens percentage points (previously low-teens percentage points), excluding pandemic solutions.For its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, GSK expects double-digit growth to be driven by strong demand in existing markets and geographical expansion.GSK has its share of problems. While GSK’s first-half performance was better than expected and ahead of the full-year guidance, it expects lower reported growth in the second half. Compared with the first half of the year, GSK expects to record slightly lower sales in the second half of 2022 due to some channel stocking in the United States during the first half of 2022. With regard to its COVID-19 solutions, GSK expects sales to be substantially lower in the second half. GSK said that the majority of expected COVID-19 solutions sales for 2022 were achieved in the first half of 2022.Generic competition for key drug, Advair is hampering sales of GSK’s respiratory products, which we believe may not be compensated by new respiratory drugs. Competitive pressure on HIV drugs has risen.Nonetheless, strong sales of specialty medicines, regular pipeline success and accretive M&amp;A deals should keep the stock afloat, going forward.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and Biden's insights, you can go directly to see the 5 Healthcare Stocks to Watch in Light of Biden's 60 Minutes Interview.On September 13, the annual inflation rate came in at 8.3%, marking the highest inflation rate the US has seen in 40 years. This was one of the key topics up for discussion on CBS News' 60 Minutes with President Joe Biden. The President responded to Scott Pelley's comments on the inflation rate by explaining that the rate itself has continued to stay even while the government is trying to create more jobs for the people. The new administration has created 10 million new jobs since Biden has come into the Oval office, and has brought the unemployment rate down to about 3.7%. On the stock market, Biden is confident that massive investments in the computer chips sector in particular are going to help the market recover from its current fall as well.While the new government is trying its best to grow new industries and help existing ones survive, Biden's recent interview with CBS has led to the healthcare sector plummeting. By commenting that ""the pandemic is over,"" the President set in motion the fall of major vaccine-making companies, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) fell by 1.3% right after the interview was broadcasted, while Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) fell by 7.1%.While the pandemic's end is a cause for celebration for all, vaccine-makers might not be too pleased with this publicity. According to a Forbes article, their reign began to end early this year, as Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) hit an eight-month low this January, falling 4.4% to $160. The company's shares were down by over 20% in mid-January. About $133 billion were wiped from the company's market capitalization by this January. Moderna, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRNA) downfall was further exacerbated by the inefficacy of its COVID-19 booster against the Omicron variant which rapidly spread across the globe at the start of this year. Regardless, Biden is confident that the worst of the pandemic has passed, and the health of the people is being restored slowly but surely. In such circumstances, it is becoming crucial to keep a sharp eye on healthcare stocks, especially vaccine-makers with large COVID-19 franchises, as they are definitely set to suffer in the coming months.Story continues10 Healthcare Stocks to Watch in Light of Biden's 60 Minutes InterviewLet's now take a look at the 10 healthcare stocks to watch in light of Biden's 60 Minutes interview.Our MethodologyWe have selected healthcare stocks that fell after President Biden's comments on 60 Minutes stating that the pandemic was over.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today the completion of its acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. (GBT), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities starting with sickle cell disease (SCD). The acquisition reinforces Pfizer’s commitment to SCD, building on a 30-year legacy in the rare hematology space.GBT brings a portfolio and pipeline that has the potential to address the full spectrum of critical needs for this underserved community. GBT discovered and developed Oxbryta® (voxelotor), a first-in-class medicine that directly targets the root cause of SCD. In addition, GBT’s promising pipeline of preclinical and clinical investigational assets focused in SCD includes GBT021601 (GBT601) and inclaclumab, both of which have received Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""With Global Blood Therapeutics’ talent, portfolio, and pipeline now part of Pfizer, we look forward to accelerating innovation and expeditiously bringing multiple potential best-in-class treatments to people living with sickle cell disease,"" said Aamir Malik, Chief Business Innovation Officer, Executive Vice President, Pfizer. ""In line with our value of equity, Pfizer is committed to addressing the underserved needs of the sickle cell disease community. We are excited about these potential breakthroughs and the opportunity to transform the lives of these patients.""SCD is a lifelong, devastating inherited blood disorder impacting millions of people worldwide, predominantly in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. Pfizer will continue to build on the companies’ shared commitment to and engagement with the SCD community.Story continuesAdditional Transaction DetailsPfizer has completed its acquisition of all the outstanding shares of common stock of GBT for $68.50 per share in cash for an estimated total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion, including debt and net of cash acquired. GBT is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. In connection with the acquisition, GBT’s shares of common stock ceased trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.For additional background on the acquisition, please read the announcement press release here.About Sickle Cell DiseaseSickle cell disease (SCD) is a lifelong, debilitating inherited blood disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute pain crises and progressive end organ damage. Acute pain crisis, or vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), occurs when sickled red blood cells irritate the lining of blood vessels and cause an inflammatory response leading to vascular occlusion, tissue ischemia and pain. Complications of SCD begin in early childhood and are associated with shortened life expectancy. Early intervention and treatment of SCD have shown potential to modify the course of this disease, reduce symptoms and events, prevent long-term organ damage, and extend life expectancy. Historically, there has been a high unmet need for therapies that address the root cause of SCD and its acute and chronic complications. SCD occurs particularly among those whose ancestors are from sub-Saharan Africa, though it also occurs in people of Hispanic, South Asian, Southern European and Middle Eastern ancestry.About Oxbryta® (voxelotor)Oxbryta (voxelotor) is an oral, once-daily therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Oxbryta works by increasing hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen. Since oxygenated sickle hemoglobin does not polymerize, Oxbryta inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization and the resultant sickling and destruction of red blood cells leading to hemolysis and hemolytic anemia, which are primary pathologies faced by every single person living with SCD.In November 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Oxbryta tablets for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and in December 2021, the FDA expanded the approved use of Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD in patients 4 years of age and older in the United States. As a condition of accelerated approval for patients ages 4 and older in the United States, GBT will continue to study Oxbryta in the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study using transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocity to assess the ability of the therapy to decrease stroke risk in children 2 to 14 years of age.In recognition of the critical need for new SCD treatments, the FDA granted Oxbryta Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations for the treatment of patients with SCD. Additionally, Oxbryta received the prestigious 2021 Prix Galien USA award for ""Best Biotechnology Product"" from The Galien Foundation.Oxbryta has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Oxbryta was designated by the European Commission (EC) as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of patients with SCD, and Oxbryta was granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation in the United Kingdom from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). In February 2022, the European Commission (EC) granted Marketing Authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). The MHRA has granted Oxbryta marketing authorization in Great Britain for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. In addition, Oxbryta has received marketing authorization for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries of Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Important Safety InformationOxbryta should not be taken if the patient has had an allergic reaction to voxelotor or any of the ingredients in Oxbryta. See the end of the patient leaflet for a list of the ingredients in Oxbryta. Oxbryta can cause serious side effects, including serious allergic reactions. Patients should tell their healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if they get rash, hives, shortness of breath (difficult breathing) or swelling of the face.The most common side effects of Oxbryta include headache, diarrhea, stomach-area (abdominal) pain, nausea, rash or hives, and fever. The most common side effects of Oxbryta in children ages 4 to less than 12 years of age include fever, vomiting, rash, stomach-area (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, and headache. These are not all the possible side effects of Oxbryta. Before taking Oxbryta, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all medical conditions, including if they have liver problems; if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant as it is not known if Oxbryta can harm an unborn baby; or if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed as it is not known if Oxbryta can pass into breastmilk or if it can harm a baby. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment with Oxbryta and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose.Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how Oxbryta works. Oxbryta may also affect how other medicines work and may affect the results of certain blood tests.Patients are advised to call their doctor for medical advice about side effects. Side effects can be reported to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Side effects can also be reported at 1-833-428-4968.Full Prescribing Information for Oxbryta is available at Oxbryta.com.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $133.06 indicates a potential upside of 43.4%.The average comprises 34 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $93 to a high of $270, with a standard deviation of $33.28. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 0.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 191% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for PYPL, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for PYPLHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why PYPL Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, PYPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much PYPL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-trending-130001476.html,1664974801,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has lost 6.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share, indicating a change of -14.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 points to a change of -14.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.73 indicates a change of +20.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.84 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.91 billion and $31.54 billion estimates indicate +10% and +13% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.15 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was +9.41%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Biden, Jr. and IBM (NYSE: IBM) Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna will tour IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York site to see firsthand where the future of computing is being innovated, designed and manufactured. During the visit, IBM will announce a plan to invest $20 billion across the Hudson Valley region over the next 10 years. The goal of the investments, which will be strengthened by close collaboration with New York State, is to expand the vibrant technology ecosystem in New York to unlock new discoveries and opportunities in semiconductors, computers, hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence and quantum computers. IBM has long called New York state home, and its business supports more than 7,500 jobs across the Hudson Valley. This region has been a hub of innovation and manufacturing for decades. From Westchester County to Poughkeepsie to Albany, IBMers are pushing the limits of computing and helping clients embrace digital transformation.""IBM is deeply honored to host President Biden at our Poughkeepsie site today and we look forward to highlighting our commitments to the innovations that advance America's economy,"" Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, said. ""As we tackle large-scale technological challenges in climate, energy, transportation and more, we must continue to invest in innovation and discovery - because advanced technologies are key to solving these problems and driving economic prosperity, including better jobs, for millions of Americans.""President Biden's visit to the IBM Poughkeepsie site highlights the CHIPS and Science Act's unique opportunity to advance American innovation and manufacturing. The technology that IBM delivers today from Poughkeepsie will directly benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act that the President recently signed into law. It will ensure a reliable and secure supply of next-generation chips for today's computers and artificial intelligence platforms as well as fuel the future of quantum computing by accelerating research, expanding the quantum supply chain, and providing more opportunities for researchers to explore business and science applications of quantum systems.Story continuesIBM's Poughkeepsie site has helped the country embrace the transformative power of technology since 1941, from manufacturing armaments during World War II to developing and building the latest generation mainframe computers. In Poughkeepsie, IBM builds state-of-the-art mainframe computers that power the global economy. The site also is home to IBM's first Quantum Computation Center – where a large number of real quantum computers run in the cloud. IBM's vision is for Poughkeepsie to become a global hub of the company's quantum computing development, just as it is today for mainframes.The future of semiconductor technologies also is being created in the Hudson Valley, from Yorktown Heights to Albany and beyond. In Albany, a unique public-private semiconductor ecosystem is where IBM last year announced the first 2 nanometer chip technology, one of the semiconductor industry's biggest breakthroughs of the last decade. The expansion of Albany's collaborative innovation model could be a foundation for the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) that will be implemented as part of the CHIPS and Science Act.IBM's announcement today builds on and expands these investments in the future of American innovation, and will fuel economic growth and job opportunities for people of all backgrounds to work with cutting-edge systems and accelerate the pace of discovery across the Hudson Valley.About IBM:ibm.comMedia Contacts:Ashley Brightbrighta@us.ibm.comMiki Carvermiki.carver@ibm.com IBM Corporation logo.SOURCE IBM]"

The automaker said its U.S. sales rose 24% compared to the same period last year from 446,997 to 555,580.In a press release, the company said “GM and its dealers were able to translate improved semiconductor supplies, stable production and improvements in dealer inventory into a nearly 3-point improvement in retail market share year over year… as well as significant sales gains in the commercial fleet market.”""What GM tells me is they certainly got a lot of their backlog supply issues filled because they had a lot of cars sitting around that weren't being sold because they had a few pieces or parts missing,"" Brauer said. ""And I think they got all those cars cleared out, put into the dealerships, and we saw their inventory numbers grow and, of course, their sales grow tremendously.""Ford (F) is another example of an automaker trying to bounce back from supply chain disruptions. The company saw overall vehicle sales fall in September while electric vehicle (EV) sales triple, helping the company gain 3.1% in EV market share. At the same time, the company again increased the price of its electric F-150 Lightning Pro truck amid ""ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs and other market factors.""Story continuesPresident Biden test drives an electric hummer as he tours the General Motors Factory ZERO electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit on November 17, 2021.

The company delivered a record 343,830 vehicles to customers in the three-month period ending in September, a notch higher from the 255,000 in the prior quarter that was hampered by the temporary factory shutdowns in China.""It is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistical weeks,” Tesla said in a statement on Sunday.Tesla CEO Elon Musk also weighed in on the logistical challenges with the company's Chinese factory, writing on Twitter: ""Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts ofChina, then cars for nearby parts of China. Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1.""As for Toyota Motor (TM), sales dropped 7% in the quarter to 526,017 vehicles. Supply concerns also dragged down sales of Fiat Chrysler (STLA) by 6%, while Honda (HMC) saw Q3 sales numbers plummet by 35%.“We're certainly not out of the woods yet,"" Brauer said.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to skip our introduction to the hedge fund and find out about more stocks, then take a look at 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Ed Bosek's BeaconLight Capital. BeaconLight Capital is an American hedge fund that is based out of New York, New York. It is one of the younger hedge funds out there, as it was set up by Mr. Ed Bosek in 2010.The investor set up his hedge fund when he was 29, and like his peers in the hedge fund industry, he also spent time working in the industry before launching his own fund. Prior to setting up BeaconLight Capital, Mr. Bosek worked at the famed investment bank Deutsche Bank and at the European hedge fund Atticus. He grew up in New York's Staten Island and attended the Regis High School in Manhattan.When he was younger, the executive did not want to enter the financial world, and instead, he was more attracted to the medical profession. He enrolled in the illustrious University of Pennsylvania to become a doctor, and it was during this time at the university that he interacted with students from the Wharton School of Business. This led to a growing interest in finance and economics developing for Mr. Bosek, and he would go on to abandon his medical dreams and instead pursue a Master of Business Administration from Wharton as part of his undergraduate courses.After graduation, the executive moved to Europe for an internship with Deutsche Bank, and after initially accepting a full time offer, he decided to leave the investment bank and join the hedge fund world. During his search for the perfect fund, he would come to like the approach of Atticus Capital's founder Mr. Tim Barakett, and go on to join the fund's European team. Atticus' differences from traditional investment banks and larger hedge funds would attract Mr. Bosek, and he would go on to become the fourth member of the team.Story continuesDuring his time at Atticus, the now hedge fund executive would see the fund's portfolio grow from $1 billion to $22 billion in 2007. He left Atticus in 2009, stating that it was becoming harder to generate strong returns for large portfolio sizes. A year later, Mr. Bosek set up BeaconLight Capital with just $50 million in funds. His new hedge fund would focus intensely on research and develop an investment approach that is described as FMD. Short for ""fundamental, meaningful, and different"", 'fundamental' analyzes a business's underlying drivers, 'meaningful' estimates the sheer impact that a company can make through outperforming expectations, and 'different' emphasizes the fund's ability to take positions that others in the industry would balk at.This approach does seem to be yielding dividends, as, by the end of the second quarter of this year, BeaconLight Capital had a portfolio that was worth $215 million. The top picks in this portfolio are General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CCK), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG).10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Ed Bosek's BeaconLight CapitalOur Methodology We studied BeaconLight Capital's Q2 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sift out its top investment picks.

(NYSE:CVE): We continue to remain positive on the outlook for Energy. While a potential U.S. recession would result in softer oil demand, we believe this would be more than outweighed by China re-opening over the coming year (which would see a major lift in car and air traffic). Oil supply continues to remain constrained with sustained declines in global inventories and OPEC+ remains unable to grow production significantly. With the sell-off in energy stocks, MEG and Cenovus are currently generating more than 20% of their market cap in cash flow with large dividends and share buybacks to come.Cenovus Energy (Long +14%) shares rallied driven by continued strong free cash flow generation, as well as being positioned to benefit from strong refining margins and downstream operations. The company recently announced a significant increase in dividends, which gives us greater confidence on the potential for a 100% return of free cash flow generation via dividends and buybacks from early CY23. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate the company is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. At present, oil prices are more than double this break-even point, implying considerable upside to consensus cash flow estimates (if prices remain near current levels). There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.”7.

In constant currency, sales increased 6% driven by growth in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Both comparisons include a 1% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Company's Kitchen Basics business.Operating income was $235 million in the third quarter compared to $265 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income was $239 million compared to $272 million in the third quarter of 2021.Earnings per share was $0.82 in the third quarter as compared to $0.79 in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.80 in the year-ago period.For fiscal year 2022, McCormick reaffirmed its sales, operating income, and earnings per share outlook.Chairman and CEO's Remarks Lawrence E. Kurzius, Chairman and CEO, stated, ""Our record third quarter sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Our 6% constant currency sales growth was led by continued momentum in our Flavor Solutions segment across all three regions. The performance of our Consumer segment reflects strong underlying growth tempered by the impacts of divesting our Kitchen Basics business, exiting a low margin business in India, and exiting our Consumer business in Russia. We continue to actively respond to changes in consumer behavior that are a result of broad pressure on the cost of living from inflation. We are confident our brand marketing investments, innovation and category management initiatives will continue to drive growth.""During the third quarter, supply chain challenges continued, and recovery of certain constrained materials has taken longer than expected. We continued to incur elevated costs to meet high demand in some parts of our business, while in other parts of our business, where demand has moderated, we are experiencing lower operating leverage. Across the supply chain, we remain focused on managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies, though the normalization of our supply chain costs is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin. Over the coming months, we will be aggressively eliminating supply chain inefficiencies. Importantly, as we had expected in the third quarter, we began to recover the cost inflation that had been outpacing our pricing actions and other levers. We expect this will continue into next year as we plan to fully offset inflation over time.Story continues""We remain confident that the strength of our business model and the value of our products and capabilities position us well for the long-term and will allow us to successfully navigate this dynamic global environment. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that have accelerated since the beginning of the pandemic, including the sustained shift to cooking more at home, increased digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating, and trusted brands. Our alignment with these trends, in combination with the breadth and reach of our portfolio and our strategic investments provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. McCormick's long-term performance, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility, has been industry-leading. The long-term fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain strong and our experienced leaders are executing on our proven strategies while adapting to challenges accordingly.""I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. With our vision to stand together for flavor and our relentless focus on growth, performance, and people, we are confident we will drive future sustainable growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.""Third Quarter 2022 ResultsMcCormick reported a 3% sales increase in the third quarter from the year-ago period. In constant currency, sales grew 6%, reflecting 10% growth from pricing actions partially offset by a 1% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 1% decline attributable to the exits of a low margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia, and a 2% decline in all other volume and product mix.Third quarter sales grew at a constant currency three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% for the total Company off of a pre-pandemic baseline of 2019. The three-year constant currency CAGR's for the Consumer segment and the Flavor Solutions segment were 6% and 8%, respectively, showing sustained momentum in the business in both segments.Higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, partially offset by pricing actions and cost savings led by the Company's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program, resulted in a decline in gross profit margin of 320 basis points. Operating income was $235 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $265 million in the third quarter of 2021. This decline was driven by gross margin compression, primarily in the Company's Flavor Solutions segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were comparable to the third quarter of last year with higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments offset by lower employee benefit expenses. Excluding special charges, as well as transaction and integration expenses, adjusted operating income was $239 million compared to $272 million in the year-ago period.Earnings per share was $0.82 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $0.79 in the third quarter of 2021. The net favorable impact of the gain on the sale of the Kitchen Basics business and special charges increased earnings per share by $0.13 in the third quarter of 2022. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.01 in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding these impacts, adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $0.80 in the year-ago period. This decrease was driven by lower adjusted operating income.Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $250 million compared to $373 million through the third quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income and higher inventory levels.Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Outlook For fiscal year 2022, McCormick reaffirmed its financial outlook which was previously issued with the Company's preliminary third quarter 2022 results on September 7, 2022.The Company continues to expect foreign currency rates in 2022 to unfavorably impact net sales by 3% and unfavorably impact adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by 2%.McCormick expects 2022 sales to range from comparable to 2021 to an increase of 2%, which in constant currency is sales growth of 3% to 5%. These comparisons include an unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Company's Kitchen Basics business. McCormick expects sales growth to be driven by pricing actions, which, in conjunction with cost savings, are expected to offset inflationary pressures over time. McCormick also plans to drive continued growth through the strength of its brands, as well as brand marketing, new products, category management, and differentiated customer engagement.Operating income in 2022 is expected to decline 10% to 8% from $1.02 billion in 2021. The Company expects approximately $46 million of special charges in 2022 that relate to previously approved organization and streamlining actions as well as integration expenses related to the FONA acquisition of approximately $2 million in 2022. Excluding the impact of special charges and transaction and integration expenses in 2022 and 2021, the Company projects adjusted operating income to decline 13% to 11%, or 11% to 9% in constant currency.McCormick projects earnings per share to be in the range of $2.64 to $2.69, compared to $2.80 in 2021. The Company expects the net favorable impact of the gain on the sale of the Kitchen Basics business, special charges and transaction and integration expenses to increase earnings per share by approximately $0.01 in 2022. Excluding these impacts, the Company projects 2022 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 in 2021. This projection includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Kitchen Basics business.Business Segment Results Consumer Segment(in millions)Three months endedNine months ended8/31/20228/31/20218/31/20228/31/2021Net sales$ 927.9$ 921.9$ 2,720.1$ 2,813.9Operating income, excluding special charges, transaction and integration expenses183.7187.8475.5554.5Consumer segment sales increased 1% from the third quarter of 2021 and in constant currency increased 4%.

In constant currency, Flavor Solutions operating income declined 34% driven by higher cost inflation, elevated costs to meet high demand, unfavorable product mix and spending related to supply chain investments.

These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:Special charges – In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned ""Special charges"" in arriving at our consolidated operating income.

The sale of our 26% interest in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd resulted in a gain of $13.4 million, net of tax of $5.7 million. The gain is included in Income from unconsolidated operations in our consolidated income statement for the nine months ended August 31, 2021.Gain on sale of Kitchen Basics - We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of our Kitchen Basics business in August 2022. The pre-tax gain associated with the sale was $49.6 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2022.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed ""on a constant currency basis"", is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income as well as compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the comparative year.

Also, this week PNC launched a new career development and tuition benefit available to its employees nationwide.""With PartnerUp's expansion, we're working with more employers and local education partners to provide local high school graduates with the skills needed to land entry-level careers in high-demand industries like healthcare and financial services, without the burden of student loan debt,"" said Vicki Henn, PNC chief human resources officer. ""As a talent-focused company, we're committed to investing in impactful skills development programs and educational initiatives that help drive career growth and economic opportunity in the communities we serve.""Since PartnerUp's inception in 2018, PNC Bank has partnered with 30 schools and 16 employers to offer more than 6,000 high school students the opportunity to secure a more direct, debt-free route to in-demand careers. PNC's effort to extend the career development program to more high schoolers comes as employers across the country continue to grapple with worker shortages in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.""In today's labor market, it's more important than ever that employers challenge our thinking on the experiences and qualifications needed for available jobs, and our roles as leaders in developing talent,"" said Brianna McMeekin, PNC talent program manager. ""With this expansion into new markets, PartnerUp is giving more employers the opportunity to invest and build a pipeline of talent from local high schools, where we're creating content to match career education standards and offering real pathways to success for students, post-graduation.""Story continuesPartnerUp's push into the Cleveland and Birmingham regions builds on the company's multi-year effort to develop a scalable career pathway program that could be replicated and deployed in additional communities across its footprint. Throughout the school year, the multi-session program offers students in-school curriculum and career development resources, such as resume writing, interview coaching and employer recruitment events to help prepare graduates to go straight into the workforce.Since 2018, PNC Bank has offered more than 100 PartnerUp graduates diverse roles at the financial services company, and 87 have accepted and started their career paths with the company. Other graduates of the program have landed at partner companies.For Neylienid Quinones, a recent graduate of Cleveland's John Marshall School of Civic &amp; Business Leadership, the hands-on training, networking resources and career coaching offered through PartnerUp has turned into a life-changing opportunity. The 18-year-old recently landed an entry-level position with PNC's Talent Recruitment team, after successfully completing the program's curriculum. Quinones is one of more than 30 Cleveland Metropolitan School District seniors who received job offers from PNC or other employer partners participating in the PartnerUp program.""It was an eye opener,"" she said. ""I was looking for a job, but I wasn't expecting to get such a big job. I was working in fast food at the time and thinking I would try to go into retail. But instead, I had the opportunity to go from fast food to a career on my second job.""PartnerUp is one of two career development initiatives the company has invested in to help meet increased demand for skilled workers throughout its footprint. In partnership with Guild, PNC recently introduced an education benefit available to the company's 62,000 employees after 90 days of employment.The new benefit gives full-time and part-time employees access to a best-in-class education experience that includes a curated catalog of tuition-covered professional certificates, college prep courses, and associate and bachelor's degrees to help advance career mobility. Fully funded, partially funded and reimbursement options are available.""We're honored to partner with PNC to bring career opportunities to its workforce,"" said Natalie McCullough, Guild president and chief commercial officer.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the retailer had lost 4.05% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 3.44% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.29% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Target as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.14, down 29.37% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $26.37 billion, up 2.81% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.11 per share and revenue of $109.8 billion. These totals would mark changes of -40.19% and +3.58%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Target. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

BJ, one of the leading operators of membership warehouse clubs, has been reinforcing its position in the industry with its strong customer value proposition and business model. Its relentless efforts to boost the membership base, simplify assortments, enhance digital capabilities and accelerate club openings have been contributing to sales. The company has been sparing no effort to bolster omnichannel operations and ramp up delivery services.Let’s Delve DeeperBJ's Wholesale Club’s focus on simplifying assortments, boosting marketing and merchandising capabilities, expanding into high-demand categories as well as building its own-brands portfolio bodes well. Own brands penetration increased 200 basis points to 25% of merchandise sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. These endeavors have contributed to growth in membership signups and renewals, resulting in higher membership fee income and decent comparable club sales growth.While the membership fee income jumped 11.3% year over year, the member count increased 6% in the second quarter, buoyed by healthy renewal rates and membership acquisitions. Markedly, total comparable club sales jumped 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of gasoline sales, comparable club sales rose 7.6%, driven by traffic growth and gains in market share led by grocery and perishable categories.BJ's Wholesale Club has been directing resources toward expanding digital capabilities to better engage with members and provide them with a convenient way to shop, including same-day delivery, curbside pick-up and buy-online, pickup-in-club. It has built a strong digital portfolio with Bjs.com, BerkleyJensen.com, Wellsleyfarms.com, delivery.bjs.com as well as BJ’s mobile app. These enable members to buy, review products and digitally add coupons to their membership card.To make shopping convenient, BJ’s Wholesale Club provides a buy now, pay later payment option to its members through Citizens Pay. Additionally, BJ's Wholesale Club’s ExpressPay allows members to scan items as they shop, and pay for their purchases in the BJ’s mobile app. BJ's Wholesale Club has also teamed up with DoorDash to provide on-demand grocery delivery from its stores. The company has also rolled out Same-Day Select through which members, on payment of an upfront fee, can avail of either unlimited or a set number of same-day grocery deliveries, delivered in as little as two hours.Management believes that digitally engaged members have higher average baskets and make more trips per year than members who shop in-club only. Digitally-enabled sales rose 47% in the second quarter. Clubs fulfill approximately 80% of digitally enabled sales.Bottom LineWe believe that BJ's Wholesale Club’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and digitization should keep supporting comparable sales trends. BJ's Wholesale Club, which shares space with Costco COST, Dollar General DG and Target TGT, now envisions fiscal 2022 comparable club sales, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, to increase between 4% and 5%, up from the prior view of low-single-digit growth.A Synopsis of Other StocksCostco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register impressive sales numbers. Costco’s net sales grew 15.2% year over year to $70,764 million, while membership fees increased 7.5% to $1,327 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Dollar General’s initiatives such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and private fleet should benefit the top line. The company has been sparing no effort to bolster omnichannel operations and ramp up delivery services to provide customers with a frictionless shopping experience. Dollar General’s partnership with DoorDash continues to yield results with same-day delivery now available at more than 13,300 stores at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Target has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. The company has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the ever-evolving retail landscape. These have been contributing to the top line.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Recent times have been advantageous for CSX as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. See our latest analysis for CSX peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on CSX will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like CSX's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 21% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 32% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 7.8% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth each year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that CSX's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that CSX maintains its moderate P/E off the back of its forecast growth being in line with the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.Having said that, be aware  CSX is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

(NASDAQ:ADI). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$180 and falling to the lows of US$139. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Analog Devices' current trading price of US$152 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Analog Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices What's The Opportunity In Analog Devices?Good news, investors! Analog Devices is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $217.25, but it is currently trading at US$152 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Analog Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Analog Devices?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Analog Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 97%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ADI is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADI for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ADI. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you want to dive deeper into Analog Devices, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Tower AMT, SBA Communications SBAC and Crown Castle Inc. CCIHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Tower REITs Seek Expansion Opportunities on Solid DemandTower real estate investment trusts (REITs) like American Tower, SBA Communications and Crown Castle Inc. are well-poised to benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers. This is due to the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally.Moreover, wireless connectivity usage has significantly increased owing to the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet of Things. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have aided the rise.This has resulted in wireless service providers and carriers expanding their networks and deploying additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity to meet the rising consumer demand.Consequently, the tower leasing demand has increased tremendously. This is expected to fuel the top-line growth of tower REITs.Also, with the increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications, such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, wireless consumer demand is expected to escalate considerably.To capitalize on this upbeat trend, American Tower, SBA Communications and Crown Castle have been focusing on strategic acquisitions and development activities.Story continuesIn the second quarter, SBAC acquired 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil for total cash consideration of $127.3 million and built 100 towers. It is also under contract to acquire roughly 2,600 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Similarly, in 2021, AMT acquired Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, consisting of 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain. This provided the company with a significant scale in these attractive markets and enabled it to diversify its footprint with a strong, primarily tier-1, multinational tenant base.During the second quarter of 2022, AMT spent roughly $90 million on the acquisition of 118 communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets. These included 96 communications sites relating to its prior-announced agreement with Orange S.A. and fiber connected to its communications sites in Spain from Telefónica de España S.A.U.AMT's development plan also assumes the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites across its international footprint.CCI, too, expects to double the rate of small cell deployments next year compared with the 5,000 nodes it anticipates putting on air in 2022, as 5G deployment is expected to require a greater scale of small cell deployment to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network.Further, these REITs have solid balance-sheet strength with ample liquidity and financial flexibility. This supports their expansionary efforts to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

In July, it announced the acquisition of Paladin Advisors, an independent, registered investment advisor, to strengthen its private wealth management business. In April, the company completed the acquisition of Investors for $3.39 billion, which strengthened its banking franchise and boosted its consumer customer base.Citizens Financial remains on track to achieve $130 million of pre-tax run-rate net expense synergies by 2023, with 70% of the run rate expected to be achieved by 2022. Such buyouts will drive its growth momentum.CFG’s organic growth story remains impressive, with loans and deposits seeing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% and 11%, respectively, over the last three years (2019–2021). Further, the rising trend for both metrics continued in the first half of 2022.The company has been enhancing its deposit base by advancing its deposit-gathering capabilities and digital-first model focused on national expansion. Its acquisition of HSBC branches added $6.3 billion of low-cost deposits. This, along with the acquisition of Investors, gives it a preeminent deposit ranking in the key New York City Metro market.Also, the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy stance to tame inflation will support the net interest income (NII) of banks, including CFG, Webster Financial Corporation WBS and Regions Financial Corporation RF. Notably, banks have been reeling under near-zero interest rates since March 2020, which adversely impacted net interest margin (NIM) and NII.Regions Financial’s NII witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% over the last five years (2017-2021) and increased in the first half of 2022. This has likely been supported by its solid loan growth trend and rising rates.Story continuesWBS’ NII witnessed a CAGR of 3.1% over the last five years (2017-2021) with some annual volatility. The metric witnessed a rising trend in the first half of 2022. Also, the trend is likely to continue on a decent economic scenario and higher rates.CFG’s strong capital base enables it to enhance shareholder value. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company increased the authorization of common share repurchases to $1 billion from $750 million. This marks an increase of $545 million in addition to $455 million worth of remaining capacity under the prior $750-million January 2021 authorization.This July, the company increased its common stock dividend by 8%. Given its steadily improving performance and strong liquidity position, Citizens Financial’s capital-deployment activities are sustainable.However, CFG’s non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 4.1% over the last four years (2018-2021), with an increasing trend in the first half of 2022. Costs are likely to remain elevated in the upcoming period due to franchise expansion nationally, as well as investments in newer technologies and building fee income capabilities. The investments might benefit the company over the long run but the increasing current expense level is limiting near-term bottom-line expansion.The loan portfolio of Citizens Financial comprises a significant amount of commercial loans (52% of loans and leases as of Jun 30, 2022). Such a lack of diversification can be risky for the company amid an uncertain economy and competitive markets.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 26, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.12 a share.Mid-America Apartment Communities' Earnings ESP sits at 1.31%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09.MAA is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Regions Financial (RF).Slated to report earnings on October 21, 2022, Regions Financial holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.61 a share 16 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regions Financial is $0.60, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.51%.Story continuesMAA and RF's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$223, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, James Hoffmeister, sold US$402k worth of shares at a price of US$231 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$188. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Visa didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$194m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Visa Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Visa insiders selling.

With Mastercard’s solution, Android smartphones can double up as reliable payment acceptance devices for contactless cards, mobile wallets and smartwatches. Moreover, the smartphones acting as a physical point of sale require no added equipment or set-up expenses.If customers choose to pay through the PayContactless solution, they need to only touch a contactless card or a wearable on the merchant’s device. However, a consumer will be required to input the bank card PIN (known only to the cardholder) on the merchant’s phone only if the transaction value surpasses the verification limit for contactless payment permissible to the customer.Both small businesses and their customers are likely to benefit from the adoption of this new solution. Small business units will gain from seamless card payment acceptance capabilities. Similarly, along with businesses, consumers will be aided by a speedier and more secure checkout experience at stores.The latest partnership reflects Mastercard’s longstanding endeavor of infusing advanced digital solutions into the global payments landscape, thus bringing in more people and businesses under the ambit of a booming digital economy. As mobile phones become integral to our lives as a handy gadget, the MA solution that turns smartphones into payment acceptance devices seems to perfectly harness the teeming prospects in the worldwide digital payments space.Story continuesAlso, the expansion of Mastercard’s Tap on Phone solution throughout Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to strengthen its presence in the region that continues to witness a widespread uptake of digital technologies.The help extended by Mastercard to small businesses via the latest initiative is aptly timed. In an evolving digital era wherein businesses were compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, micro and small businesses grappled with inadequate resources and financial uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To bail such businesses out of crisis, Mastercard steadfastly partnered numerous well-established organizations, delivering several innovative digital payment solutions and pursuing significant investments.Like Mastercard, other companies making concerted efforts to cushion small businesses include American Express Company AXP, Visa Inc. V and Global Payments Inc. GPN.To aid small businesses, American Express continues to chase technological upgrades and unveil secure digital solutions. The Global Commercial Services segment of AXP issues an array of small business cards across the globe.Visa frequently provided necessary help to small business units, ranging from technological assistance to empowering the same with enhanced payment services. The Small Business Hub was launched by V in 2020 to cater to the unique needs of small and medium-sized businesses.Global Payments works closely with several small and midsize businesses, helping the same with enhanced and safe payment technology solutions. GPN provides these businesses with the widespread acceptance of payments across varied channels, thus spurring operational efficiency.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

224,c331c1e7-b5f6-30a7-aada-bae6becaeda7,V,2022-10-06,Visa Inc. (V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-130001416.html,1664974801,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned -6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has lost 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share, indicating a change of +15.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.43 points to a change of +25.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.37 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.57 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.04 billion and $32.22 billion estimates indicate +20.5% and +10.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.98 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.11%. The EPS surprise was +13.79%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now Huawei may have a path around those restrictions.Most Read from BloombergHere’s How Weird Things Are Getting in the Housing MarketScreening Procedure Fails to Prevent Colon Cancer Deaths in Large StudyThis Is What 7% Mortgages Will Do to the Housing MarketPutin Threatens More Missile Attacks on Ukraine as Cities HitCathie Wood Warns of ‘Serious Losses’ in Automobile DebtThe Chinese technology giant is providing support to a startup in its hometown of Shenzhen that has ordered chipmaking equipment -- including from foreign suppliers -- for a semiconductor manufacturing plant, according to people familiar with the matter. The fledgling firm, Pengxinwei IC Manufacturing Co., is run by a former Huawei executive and is constructing facilities close to Huawei headquarters, according to public records and satellite photos.Huawei is expected to buy most, if not all, of its output, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. PXW, as the company is known, plans to take delivery of the gear as early as the first half of 2023, one of the people said.If it succeeds in getting off the ground, the startup could effectively enable Huawei to sidestep Washington’s efforts to choke off the flow of chips to a company it views as a military and economic threat. Huawei representatives declined to comment.The low-profile PXW has already drawn the attention of the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which helps oversee American trade restrictions.The department is aware of the startup and “allegations of relationships with Huawei,” BIS said in response to a Bloomberg News query. “BIS is constantly on the lookout for efforts to evade export controls, including those related to parties on the Entity List like Huawei, and uses open-source, proprietary and classified information to substantiate and then, when appropriate, apply our administrative or criminal law enforcement as well as regulatory tools to address violations.”Story continuesIt’s not clear whether PXW’s strategic plans explicitly violate US trade sanctions. If the firm intends to supply Huawei, it would be severely restricted in what chipmaking equipment it can buy from American suppliers. It has more latitude to buy machines from foreign suppliers such as ASML Holding NV and Tokyo Electron Ltd., though they too may need to seek US approval depending on the amount of American technology infused into any products sold.PXW said in a statement it’s inked agreements with suppliers and aims to begin production in 2025, without mentioning clients. The company plans to start working on its 28-nanometer technology -- six generations behind the most advanced manufacturing -- next year, said one person familiar with its strategy.Huawei, perhaps more than any other company, has been at the heart of US-China tensions. The Trump administration blacklisted the company in 2019 and pressed allied nations like the UK and Japan to remove its telecommunications equipment out of concern it could be used for spying and espionage. The conflict escalated with efforts to prosecute Huawei’s chief financial officer, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, on fraud charges. (Meng Wanzhou, who denied wrongdoing, was allowed to leave Canada for China last year under a deferred prosecution agreement.)Huawei has paid a heavy price. Before the blacklisting, the company was the world’s largest supplier of mobile communications equipment and competed with Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the smartphone business. Its chip design unit, HiSilicon, was a cornerstone of China’s attempts to establish a vibrant domestic semiconductor industry. The US actions drove Huawei out of many overseas markets, forced it to sell off its mass-market phone business and cut off its access to chips vital to its success. Ren said this year in an internal employee memo the company is finding it increasingly difficult to grow in the face of American sanctions.PXW won’t be able to build a chip-making business to match capabilities of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the industry leader that once supplied Huawei. But the startup could help Huawei regain ground in several critical areas, such as smartphones and servers. It’s not clear whether the company is using any assets, intellectual property or people from HiSilicon.President Joe Biden’s administration is preparing new restrictions on China’s access to chip technology that could affect PXW and similar cases. The Commerce Department plans to roll out a package of rules as soon as this week tightening curbs on semiconductor technologies that can be exported to China, people familiar with the matter have said.The US government is moving beyond blacklisting individual companies like Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in favor of broad restrictions on all Chinese companies, including a ban on purchases of artificial-intelligence chips. The White House is also considering an executive order to place curbs on US investment in Chinese tech companies.“We previously maintained a ‘sliding scale’ approach that said we need to stay only a couple of generations ahead. That is not the strategic environment we are in today,” Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Advisor, said last month. “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”In China, the Huawei episode galvanized Communist Party efforts to build a domestic semiconductor industry, a long-standing goal to better compete with the US in cutting-edge technologies. The government has poured tens of billions of dollars into the sector. Huawei itself has invested in more than 40 chip-related companies, according to a research report from Berenberg Bank.“Although Huawei does not own any manufacturing facilities for now, it is going to be one of the most important companies in driving China’s semi industry due to its products in end-markets such as networking, artificial intelligence computation, cloud, smartphones, IoT and auto,” Tammy Qiu, an analyst at Berenberg, wrote in the report in September.PXW is backed by the same Shenzhen city government that helped take over Huawei’s Honor smartphone division in 2020. The startup acquired enough land in the city to cover more than 30 soccer fields in December, and paid 158 million yuan ($23 million), according to land purchase information and its own website. Satellite photographs show buildings on the site are nearing completion, but what’s not clear is what gear will be installed inside them and where the machinery will come from.The market for chipmaking equipment is dominated by five companies -- the Netherlands’ ASML and Japan’s Tokyo Electron, as well as the US’s Applied Materials Inc., KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp. All of them are subject to complicated regulations that restrict what they can sell to Huawei and other Chinese customers. In general, the American companies are barred from selling gear to Chinese customers more advanced than 14 nanometers -- four generations behind the latest technology. US companies can’t sell anything to Huawei without a special license.Applied Materials isn’t supplying the Chinese startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Representatives for Applied and Lam Research declined to comment on PXW. KLA said in a statement that it complies with US trade regulations, including restrictions on individual companies and their affiliates.ASML, which dominates the market for lithography equipment, declined to say if it is working with PXW and said it’s up to chipmakers to disclose their suppliers. A Tokyo Electron representative said the company has not heard of PXW.PXW is targeting 14- and 7-nanometer manufacturing, less advanced than the capabilities of companies such as TSMC and Samsung, but still a challenge for Chinese chipmakers, according to one person familiar with its plans. It’s unclear how PXW could secure such technologies.Non-American companies like ASML and Tokyo Electron are in murky territory when it comes to companies blacklisted by the US, like Huawei. If their chip-making equipment contains US technology beyond a certain amount, they are restricted from selling to a customer they know works with a blacklisted company, according to Judith Alison Lee, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher.“Foreign-made items may incorporate a de minimis amount of US-origin content” -- typically 25% -- without falling under the restrictions, she said.Kevin Wolf, a former senior official at BIS and now a partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, said that, under today’s regulations, companies like ASML and Tokyo Electron can probably produce most of their chip-making equipment without crossing that threshold.“It’s unlikely that the non-US companies would get caught in any of the Huawei-specific rules,” he said.The Biden administration’s new restrictions could change that however. They may decide to block foreign companies from selling chip-making equipment to Huawei suppliers if those companies use any American components or software.PXW has hired a number of senior engineers from chip giants including China’s Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. and Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp., according to a recruitment video posted on jobs site Liepin. It has also recruited engineers from Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a $20 billion chip project that collapsed in late 2020, according to a person familiar with the matter. The young company aims to hit capacity of 20,000 wafers by 2025, the company said on its website, without elaborating on the timeframe.A Chinese foundry capable of making 14-nm chips might be good enough for Huawei. Many components of networking gear -- transceivers, application-specific integrated circuits and switch chips -- are made with that technology.Read more: Xi Renews Call for China Tech Push After US Escalates CurbsWhile Huawei’s smartphone business has been kneecapped by U.S. sanctions, it is still able to grow its telecom infrastructure business. TSMC dropped Huawei as a customer in 2020, cutting off access to a key manufacturing partner for the chips that go into phones and servers.PXW could reopen supply channels, the people said, if Washington doesn’t take further action. The US Bureau of Industry and Security declined to say whether it has approved or rejected licenses for any equipment makers to supply PXW.Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said while PXW has not been placed on its entity list for high-tech exports, no Taiwanese company has declared any shipments to the Chinese chipmaker over the past three years. The ministry added that Taiwan is stepping up efforts to clamp down on Chinese companies poaching Taiwanese talent.PXW describes itself as an emerging contract chip manufacturer. Its first plant -- named by local authorities as a strategic construction project -- aims to make chips used in cars, Internet of Things devices and phones, according to the company’s website.The company intends to develop its own technologies because of the “US hegemony” that forced China to come up with its own alternatives, a PXW employee said in a recruitment video. The goal is to make PXW a contract chip-making giant comparable to TSMC or SMIC, China’s biggest producer of chips, another employee said in the video.Huawei will collaborate with domestic chip manufacturers including ones in Qingdao, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai to get components it needs, Berenberg’s Qiu said in the September research note.“Over the next three to five years, Huawei should be able to set up manufacturing facilities and start streamlining the whole semi ecosystem,” Qiu wrote. “It is aiming to become a tier one component integrator for the auto industry, leveraging its semi, design and manufacturing capabilities.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHackers Target Eager Homebuyers With a Dumb Scam That Keeps WorkingEven After $100 Billion, Self-Driving Cars Are Going NowhereThe Massive Gas Field That Europe Can’t Use‘I Am Energy’: Inside the Bang Billionaire’s Reeling EmpireSetback in Quest for Indigenous Rights Roils Chile, Creating Challenges for Its New President©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

MYERS BEACH, Fla., Oct. 05, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon Frontline deployed its Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response (THOR) vehicle to one of the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Ian. THOR, the first and only private 5G network-capable mobile emergency operations vehicle of its kind, will augment ongoing support of first responders conducting search, rescue, response and recovery missions in and around Ft. Myers Beach, Fla.Verizon Frontline’s THOR joins more than 100 Verizon and Verizon Frontline assets already in place in Florida to help provide public safety agencies with a reliable connection for mission-critical voice, data and video communications.“THOR is one of hundreds of state-of-the-art Verizon Frontline assets and solutions we have deployed across Lee County in particular, and many of the hardest-hit areas of Florida, to support those on the front lines of Hurricane Ian response efforts,” said Maggie Hallbach, President, Verizon Frontline. “As these counties begin to rebuild following the devastation left in Ian’s wake, our focus is making sure first responders have the mission-critical technologies they need in their around-the-clock search, rescue and recovery efforts.”Verizon Frontline’s THOR was developed to provide public safety agencies with high-quality, reliable communications and advanced computing applications under nearly any condition.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.083 = US$27b ÷ (US$370b - US$49b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 8.3%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 8.3%. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceIn the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Verizon Communications.So How Is Verizon Communications' ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Verizon Communications, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 8.3%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that Verizon Communications is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 0.09% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Verizon Communications   you'll probably want to know about.While Verizon Communications isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

BoF finds out more.Increased awareness around discrimination and bias in fashion in recent years has revealed a critical need for sustained diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work in businesses, from both a moral standpoint and to ensure an effective retention strategy - especially for the next generation of talent. Management consultancy Gallup found that Gen-Z and younger millennials today place support for a diverse and inclusive workplace as a top priority in what they look for in an employer.Tapestry, a large global fashion company based in New York consisting of Coach, Kate Space and Stuart Weitzman, has committed to creating a work environment that is more diverse, equitable and inclusive. To spearhead this work, the organisation recruited David Casey as its first chief inclusion and social impact officer earlier this year, who was set an immediate task to expand diversity within leadership teams and actively reduce gaps in inclusion by gender and race/ethnicity.Now, BoF sits down with Tapestry's chief inclusion and social impact officer, David Casey, to discuss how Tapestry is executing its social impact efforts, its priorities moving forward, and the challenges and opportunities the company faces in working towards its 2025 goals.Continue reading hereTapestry, Inc., Wednesday, October 5, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.tapestry.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719071/Tapestrys-Strategy-to-Increase-Equity-and-Diversity-at-All-Employee-Levels]"

These recyclable jars are more lightweight than conventional ones and include 15% post-consumer resin.The jars are used for Mars’ products from the M&amp;M’S, SKITTLES and STARBURST brands. They come in sizes of 60-, 81- and 87-ounces and can eliminate approximately 300 tons of virgin plastic per year. These have been produced at Berry Global’s manufacturing facility using a single-pellet, food-grade resin, indicating a clean and consistent substrate sourced from mechanical recycling.Berry Global’s recyclable packaging solution furthers Mars’ commitment to sustainability. Justin Comes, vice president of R&amp;D, Mars Wrigley North America, said, ""At Mars, we want to contribute to a circular economy where packaging material never becomes waste, but is recycled, reused or composted.""Amid climate change and emission reduction targets set by governments, more companies are focusing on green initiatives.

This is certainly proving to be the case this year. With all the major U.S. indices now in bear markets, many stocks that were flying high during the pandemic are getting crushed under the weight of poor financial results, bad management and flawed strategies. Since U.S. interest rates are likely to stay elevated for some time, those equities will probably keep getting crushed for the foreseeable future. For investors looking to avoid getting badly hurt by those names, here are seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell before they die.MRNAModerna$121METAMeta Platforms$137.67GMGeneral Motors$33.21NFLXNetflix$236SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$79GPSThe Gap$8.50PTONPeleton$7.40S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Sell: Moderna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comEighteen months ago, Boston-based pharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) was the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500. From the time the pandemic hit in March 2020 to September 2021, MRNA stock ran up an incredible 2,038%, soaring from $21.30 to $449.38 per share.Investors who held Moderna stock throughout the development and commercialization of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine reaped massive returns. But now the stock has suffered a brutal reversal of fortune. Since peaking in September of last year, the share price has collapsed 70%, and it now trades at $121 a share, making it one of the worst performers in the benchmark index.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe demise of MRNA stock can be chalked up to one issue: the company does not have a robust pipeline of drugs in development beyond its coronavirus vaccine. While Moderna was one of the first companies in the world to get its Covid-19 vaccine approved, it does not have a diverse lineup of other medications to help drive its revenue higher.Story continuesAs a result, Wall Street views Moderna as a one-trick pony. As the sales growth of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine slows, the question has become: What’s next? Until Moderna answers that question, investors can expect its stock to continue sliding lower.Meta Platforms (META)META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comA recent headline on CNBC summed up the situation being endured by Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): “Facebook scrambles to escape stock’s death spiral as users flee, sales drop.”The article highlights that META stock is trading at its lowest level in three years and is one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 this year, as it has tumbled 60% since January. This morning, the shares are trading at $137.67 a share.The article also details a litany of problems at the company, ranging from declining online advertising revenue to growing competition from social media sites such as TikTok,. Meta also has internal difficulties due to its focus on the Metaverse.It all adds up to a doom-and-gloom scenario for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the shareholders who have stood by as the company underwent a brand transformation late last year. Meanwhile, Meta continues to face a barrage of criticism over the misinformation that has spread on its social media platforms.While Meta Platforms continues to earn the bulk of its revenue from online ads, the company is working double time to shift its core business to virtual reality headsets and other technology needed to create the Metaverse. Whether the switch will be successful is a multi-billion dollar question that is weighing heavily on META stock.General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLike most automakers, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is in the process of electrifying its vehicle fleet. The legendary Detroit automaker has allocated $35 billion to the development of electric vehicles through 2025.In addition to churning out electric models of popular vehicles such as the Chevy Blazer sport utility vehicle and even a fully electric Hummer, General Motors is also developing several EV battery plants across the U.S. All of these initiatives are aimed at catching market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and keeping pace with archrival Ford (NYSE:F). Yet the performance of GM stock suggests that the electric revolution is not going that well at General Motors.In 2022, GM stock is down 44% at $32.88 per share. While most auto stocks have tumbled this year along with the broader market, investors have sold off GM stock particularly hard.One of the big reasons for the selloff is that the company continues to face a shortage of parts as it is having difficulty obtaining them. This has hurt GM’s earnings and has disappointed investors on both Wall Street and Main Street.Most recently, General Motors reported earnings per share of $1.14, compared to the EPS of $1.20 that analysts, on average, had forecast. The supply chain problems and poor earnings have cast a shadow over GM’s big electrification push and raised doubts in the minds of investors.Although I still hold GM stock due to my position being deeply underwater, I believe other investors should sell shares now, if possible, because the near-term challenges facing the company are just too great.Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comAfter a decade of dominance, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is no longer the top streaming platform. That title now belongs to the Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS).This has led to a crisis at NFLX whose name was synonymous with streaming movies and TV shows not that long ago. Facing a glut of competition, Netflix is taking steps to diversify and bolster its revenue stream, from pushing into video games to launching a new tier for streaming that includes advertising. The company is taking the latter step even though it long said that it would never do so. So far, the efforts have not stopped the erosion of Netflix’s subscriber base, which is down by more than 1 million households this year.Prior to this year, it had been more than a decade since Netflix reported a net loss of subscribers. News of the loss has sent investors screaming for the exits. After climbing relentlessly during the pandemic, NFLX stock hit a peak of $700 a share in October 2021.Since then, the share price has fallen 66% to $236. At one point, the stock was down to a 52-week low of $162.71. Can the stock recover even though Netflix’s sector is suddenly crowded with competition?The jury is out. But Netflix continues to invest heavily in new content, announcing that it is spending $17 billion on programming this year alone. Its rival, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is spending $15 billion on streaming content.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)A photo of a sledgehammer on an asphalt surface.Source: goldleviza / Shutterstock.comAnother S&amp;P 500 stock to sell before it dies is Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK). While investors don’t hear as much about this stock as the others on this list, the tool maker  has fallen on hard times. The company went gangbusters during the pandemic as homeowners upgraded their houses while sheltering in place. But after running up 177% between March 2020 and May 2021, SWK stock peaked at $219 a share and has been steadily deflating ever since. Having fallen 60% this year, Stanley Black &amp; Decker stock is now trading at $79 per share, lower than where it was when Covid-19 first hit.The company just announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs in its finance department to help lower its costs as its outlook darkens. The company has said its earnings are being negatively impacted by not only a decline in home renovation projects, but also by rising interest rates and inflation that are leading to a slowdown in overall consumer spending on its power tools.Consequently, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has announced that it is planning to cut up to $200 million of costs by year’s end. The company has about 70,000 employees worldwide.The Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockRetailers are another category of stocks that have taken it on the chin this year. But few retail stocks have taken as hard a knock as The Gap (NYSE:GPS).Down 55% on the year and now trading under $9 a share, GPS stock ended 2021 trading right around $25. The massive retreat has been due to a combination of bloated inventories and poor sales at both The Gap and its sister chain, Old Navy. The San Francisco-based company also recently announced a round of job cuts, trimming 500 positions from its corporate ranks. The layoffs came after the company’s CEO, Sonia Syngal, abruptly stepped down in July.The negative news at The Gap was also amplified recently with the announcement that singer Kanye West prematurely ended his promotional deal with the clothing and apparel retailer.This would be a lot for any company to endure in a year. But most of this drama has occurred at The Gap over the summer. Where the company goes from here is not clear. But its reputation with consumers and investors has taken a big hit, and confidence in the company’s management team is low.With inflation remaining stubbornly high at more than 7% and interest rates expected to continue rising in coming months, don’t expect GPS stock to recover anytime soon.Peloton (PTON)Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefrontSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCan Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) survive? If there’s one company on this list that is in real danger of disappearing, it is the internet- connected maker of treadmills and exercise bikes. So far this year, PTON stock has cratered 80% and now trades at under $8 a share. The company is barely keeping its head above the $5 penny stock threshold.At its pandemic peak, Peloton’s stock was trading near $165 a share. But as gyms and fitness centers reopened and people gave up their subscriptions to Peloton’s online fitness classes that they were using at home, the company’s earnings and stock have imploded.Of course, Peloton is trying to recover. The New York City-based company has hired a new executive team and switched its strategy from focusing on sales of treadmills and bikes to concentrating more on monthly subscriptions to its online classes.Most recently, Peloton announced a deal with retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) to sell its equipment in Dick’s more than 850 outlets across the U.S. The deal marks the first time that Peloton has joined forces with a brick-and-mortar retailer, diversifying its sales approach from strictly online channels.The company has also struck a deal to place its exercise bikes in all 5,400 Hilton (NYSE:HLT)-branded hotels in the U.S.Despite these efforts, the question remains whether it is too little, too late for PTON stock.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GM and DIS.

Selling at an average price of US$212, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA NVIDIA Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Mark Stevens, for US$51m worth of shares, at about US$186 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$132. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in NVIDIA didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does NVIDIA Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that NVIDIA insiders own 4.0% of the company, worth about US$13b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NVIDIA Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no NVIDIA insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of NVIDIA, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for NVIDIA.Of course NVIDIA may not be the best stock to buy.

MCK, and Humana HUM – should all be considered.The chart below illustrates the share performance of all three companies year-to-date with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three have widely outperformed the general market in 2022, telling us that market participants have defended them all year long. Let’s take a closer look at each one.McKesson Corp. McKesson Corp. is a healthcare services and information technology company operating through two segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions.MCK’s near-term earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months, pushing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, McKesson looks to continue its growth trajectory; for its current fiscal year (FY23), earnings are forecasted to climb by 3%.And in FY24, bottom line estimates call for an additional 6.6% of growth.MCK’s top line is also in exceptional health – revenue estimates suggest Y/Y growth of 5% and 4.3% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson shares could also be seen as undervalued, further bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Value. The company’s 14.5X forward earnings multiple is above its five-year median but represents a sizable 31% discount relative to its Zacks Medical Sector.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMolina HealthcareMolina Healthcare is a multi-state managed care organization participating exclusively in government-sponsored healthcare programs. MOH sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Analysts have raised their bottom-line outlook across nearly all timeframes over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMolina Healthcare’s growth trajectory is impossible to ignore – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $17.65 for its current fiscal year (FY22) pencils in a stellar double-digit 31% Y/Y uptick. For FY23, estimates are calling for an additional 13.5% of growth.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue increases of 12.5% and 6.3% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, Molina Healthcare has an impressive earnings track record, exceeding revenue and earnings estimates in each of its last four quarters. Just in its latest print, the company registered a 4.8% EPS beat paired with a 6.2% revenue beat.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana Humana is a health care plan provider in the United States, providing health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization, Private Fee-For-Service, and Preferred Provider Organization plans. HUM sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Over the last few months, analysts have had a bullish stance on the company’s bottom line outlook while also being in full agreement.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHUM shares trade at a 20.2X forward earnings multiple, just a tick above their 19.7X five-year median and representing a slight 5% discount relative to their Zacks Medical Sector average.Humana boasts a Style Score of an A for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MOH and MCK, Humana carries a rock-solid growth profile; earnings are forecasted to grow by 21% in FY22 and a further double-digit 12% in FY23.Humana’s top line estimates are also inspiring – the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $93 billion for FY22 suggests revenue growth of nearly 12% compared to FY21 sales of $83.1 billion. In FY23, estimates call for a further 9% of revenue growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile price action in 2022 has been overwhelmingly negative, some areas, such as healthcare stocks, are putting their defensive nature on full display.Consumers have a never-ending need for the services these companies provide, helping explain why these stocks are generally seen as a safer place to park cash. All three stocks above – Molina Healthcare MOH, McKesson Corp. MCK, and Humana HUM – operate in the healthcare realm, have betas of less than 1.0, and have inspiring growth profiles.To put the cherry on top, all three carry a favorable Zacks Rank.All three deserve a watchlist spot for those looking to deploy a heavier defensive approach.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its strict cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.Even though copper prices have declined lately, it will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States and the global initiatives to address climate change.

(NYSE: CMI) continues to make significant investments in solar energy with the installation of Cummins’ second largest solar array at Rocky Mount Engine Plant in North Carolina (U.S.). The RMEP solar installation will directly support the company’s environmental sustainability strategy, PLANET 2050, by using low-carbon renewable power to reduce greenhouse gases.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221005005624/en/Rocky Mount Engine Plant solar installation (Photo: Business Wire)As part of the 2030 goals included in PLANET 2050, the strategy calls for reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions from facilities and operations by 50%. The RMEP solar array and increasing the use of renewable power will significantly help move closer to that target, producing zero emissions throughout the process.The mid-range diesel and natural gas engine plant produces engines for more than 500 customers and is a major employer in Nash County with over 1,800 people employed at the location. The 3.62 MW solar farm, which sits on 14 acres, produces power directly sent to the plant, reducing its commercial energy needs.The solar installation will produce around 5.6 million kWh of power annually and more than 136 million kWh over 25 years. Annually, the solar installation will sequester the carbon equivalent of 4,862 acres of forest, roughly the space occupied by the Raleigh-Durham International Airport.""We have ambitious sustainability goals in PLANET 2050 - aligned with the Paris climate accords and a target to be carbon-neutral by 2050 - and are fully committed to achieving them,"" said Jennifer Rumsey, President and CEO, Cummins. ""To get there, our efforts must touch our products, customers, facilities, employees and supply chain. This project is a reflection of that, and our goal of reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions from facilities and operations by half by 2030. I was delighted to participate in the ribbon cutting of the solar farm this spring, and proud to see it now in operation and making an impact.""Story continuesUniqiue to RMEP, the project uses solar tracking panels. This system has a single-axis tracker allowing the panels to arc and track the sun as it rises and sets. This increases system efficiency without having to install more panels.

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) share price is down 43% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 18%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 22% in the last three years. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 9.4% in a month.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Walt Disney share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 191%. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Walt Disney managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Walt Disney in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 18% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 43%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.2%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Before forming an opinion on Walt Disney you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.But note: Walt Disney may not be the best stock to buy.

Hulu ended the quarter with 46.2 million paid subscribers, up from 42.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The rapidly growing subscriber base strengthens Disney’s position in the increasingly saturated streaming space currently dominated by Netflix and the growing prominence of services from Apple AAPL, Comcast CMCSA, Amazon prime video and HBO Max.New President &amp; Ad-Tier for Disney+Disney recently appointed Alisa Bowen as the President of Disney+, effective immediately. Bowen will continue to report to Michael Paull, President, Direct to Consumer, Disney Media Entertainment &amp; Distribution.Disney is now set to launch a new ad-supported offering for the Disney+ streaming service starting Dec 8, 2022. The new ad-supported Disney+ Basic subscription will cost $7.99 a month, which is the current pricing for Disney+ without ads. Disney noted that the ad-free subscription plan will be called Disney+ Premium and will cost $10.99 a month.Disney is also raising the price of its Hulu subscription. The ad-free tier will jump from $12.99/month to $14.99, while the ad-supported version will cost $7.99/month, up from $6.99. The new pricing goes into effect on Oct 10, 2022. A price hike for ESPN+ streaming was announced in July, taking the monthly price from $6.99 to $9.99/month.Subscription costs for users with an ad-free Disney+ subscription along with an ad-supported plan for Hulu and ESPN Plus will increase from $13.99 to $14.99/month. Disney is also introducing a bundle that includes Disney+ and Hulu with ads for $9.99/month. Meanwhile, bundled together, Disney+, Hulu and ad-supported ESPN+ will cost $19.99/month.Disney has also adjusted the pricing for its Hulu live TV bundles. Hulu’s live TV bundle with ad-supported Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ plans will cost $69.99/month. The live TV bundle with ad-free Disney+, as well as ad-supported Hulu and ESPN+ plans, will cost $74.99. Users will have to spend $82.99/month to get a live TV plan without ads on Disney+ or Hulu and ad-supported ESPN+.Stiff Competition Remains a HeadwindCompetition in the streaming space is becoming stiff with the launch of numerous services.Disney’s closest peer Netflix is also set to introduce a new lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan apart from its existing ad-free basic, standard and premium plans.Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+, continues to gain recognition with its critically acclaimed and popular shows like Ted Lasso.Comcast’s Peacock also offers a free-to-watch tier with ad support that has about 40,000 hours of content. Peacock is well poised to grow, owing to its vast library of IPs and new productions.Nevertheless, Disney is expected to benefit from the increase in ad-free subscription pricing as rising production and programming costs for Disney+ and higher sports programming costs at ESPN+ contributed to operating losses in the recently reported fiscal third quarter.Direct-to-Consumer revenues increased 19% year over year to $5.1 billion and operating loss increased $0.8 billion to $1.1 billion. The increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+, lower operating income at Hulu, and to a lesser extent, a higher loss at ESPN+.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Net sales of $4,484 million increased 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. On an organic basis, the company’s sales advanced 9%. This marked the 14th successive quarter of organic sales growth, with improvements in all divisions and categories.The company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well. This led to double-digit organic sales growth in its oral care business in the second quarter of 2022.Some notable efforts include the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, the Hello Products LLC buyout, and a partnership with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate.The company is aggressively expanding the geographic footprint of its brands, along with enhancing distribution to faster growth channels. It has expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. Its professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — are performing well in spas and dermatology clinics.Colgate also expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. It is gaining from strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Its Hill's business continues to witness sales momentum, with sales growth of 14.5% in the second quarter and organic sales growth of 18%. Results have gained from a 5.5% increase in unit volumes (both reported and organic) and 12.5% pricing growth, offset by a 3.5% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States, Europe and Australia/New Zealand.Strength in oral care and pet nutrition remain the key growth drivers. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate also remains focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Driven by the above-mentioned factors, management anticipates 2022 net sales growth toward the higher end of its previously mentioned 1-4% growth. Organic sales are expected to increase 5-7% compared with 4-6% growth mentioned earlier.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeThe company has been reeling under higher raw material and logistics costs worldwide, which dented the bottom-line performance in second-quarter 2022. Despite the earnings beat in second-quarter 2022, Colgate’s Base Business’s (adjusted non-GAAP) earnings of 72 cents per share declined 10% from the prior-year quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings declined 13% to 72 cents per share in the quarter under review. Adjusted earnings for 2022 are projected to decline in the mid-single digits.Also, the rise in advertising investments remains concerning. For 2022, advertising investments are expected to increase year over year on both GAAP and adjusted basis. This is likely to hurt the gross margin on both GAAP and adjusted basis for 2022. It expects $1.3 billion in raw material and packaging inflation, along with higher logistic costs, for 2022.Some other staples companies facing the heat due to higher freight costs are Procter &amp; Gamble PG, The Clorox Company CLX and Church &amp; Dwight CHD.Procter &amp; Gamble has been reeling under higher commodity and freight costs based on the current industry dynamics. PG’s fiscal 2022 earnings view includes an after-tax headwind of $2.3 billion from higher commodity costs and higher freight costs.Commodity and freight costs are likely to hurt fiscal 2022 EPS by $1.33 per share on a combined basis. Procter &amp; Gamble expects the impacts of the headwinds to be more pronounced in the first half of fiscal 2023.Clorox has been witnessing elevated manufacturing and logistics costs, and higher commodity costs. Also, record-high input cost inflation remains concerning.Going into fiscal 2023, Clorox expects cost inflation of $400 million, including commodities, transportation and wage inflation. CLX expects fiscal 2023 to remain challenging due to input cost inflation, supply-chain disruptions and the lapping of COVID-19 impacts.Church &amp; Dwight’s increased raw material, manufacturing and distribution costs are deterrents. CHD expects to face inflation at a greater rate than effective price increases in 2022.On its second-quarter earnings call, Church &amp; Dwight expected to witness additional cost inflation of $135 million for 2022. The incremental inflation is mainly associated with raw and packaging materials and the pass-through of similar costs from third-party manufacturers.ConclusionWe believe that Colgate’s strategic efforts, including product innovation, brand strength and expansion plans, will help offset cost headwinds.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

262,f211d90b-5d94-3c15-98c9-39a7702bda42,XRAY,2022-10-06,DexCom and Papa John's International have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dexcom-papa-johns-international-highlighted-135401286.html,1664978041,STORY,['XRAY'],"[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 5, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares DexCom, Inc. DXCM as the Bull of the Day and Papa John's International PZZA as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Align Technology ALGN, SmileDirectClub SDC and DENTSPLY SIRONA XRAY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:DexCom, Inc. is a medical device/wearables company focused on helping people monitor and manage their diabetes. DexCom's top-line growth has been stellar and its addressable market is massive considering how widespread diabetes is in the U.S. and elsewhere.DexCom shares got caught up in the post-covid lockdown growth-buying wave that began to unwind last fall. The glucose monitoring company is now trading at far more reasonable levels and DXCM shares have been trending upward since the middle of June.Now might be time for investors to add DexCom stock at these levels for long-term growth upside. Connected Health Revolution DexCom makes continuous glucose monitoring systems designed for people with diabetes. The San Diego, California-based firm allows people with diabetes the chance to place a small sensor just beneath their skin—most often on their abdomens—to help them continuously monitor their glucose levels. DexCom's readings and data come through on companion devices or via an app on compatible smartphones, smartwatches and other devices, including offerings from Apple, Google, and others.DexCom's systems have become widely popular because they don't require people to prick themselves throughout the day in order to measure their glucose levels. DexCom's internet-connected, data-sharing devices are also helpful because they enable family, friends, and healthcare providers to receive data remotely in order to help the users make the proper medical decisions.The company's continuous glucose monitoring or CGM systems are part of a connected health revolution that's still in the very early days and might be poised to be the standard form of medical care and treatment in the decades to come. DexCom's CGM monitors systems are more beneficial for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals compared to more traditional/old school blood glucose meters that check glucose levels at a single moment in time.Story continuesAddressable Market and Growth The simple facts are on DexCom's side as diabetes becomes far more common in the U.S. Over 37 million Americans or about 1 in 10 have diabetes, while 1 in 3 or nearly 100 million Americans have ""prediabetes,"" according to the CDC's 2021 report. Worse still, diabetes is the 8th leading cause of death in the U.S.Rising diabetes rates, mostly type-2, is not just a U.S. problem, with roughly 540 million adults, or 1 in 10 people around the world living with diabetes. The International Diabetes Federation predicts that the number could climb to 645 million by 2030 and nearly 800 million by 2045.One of the nearby charts shows DexCom's strong revenue expansion over the past decade. The firm has averaged 34% sales growth in the past five years to climb from $719 million in 2017 to $2.5 billion in FY21. Zacks estimates call for DXCM to post another 18% revenue growth in FY22 and 21% higher in fiscal 2023 to hit $3.5 billion—this is a case where the percentage change slowdown might cloud the fact that DexCom is set to add another $1 billion to its top line between 2021 and 2023.DexCom is still firmly investing in its growth. Yet, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb 18% this year and another 40% next year to come in at $1.10 per share. DXCM's upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. And the firm has topped EPS estimates for five years running outside of two recent misses.Price Performance and Valuation DexCom shares have skyrocketed roughly 2,300% in the past 10 years to blow away the S&amp;P 500's 170% and its Zacks Medical Products Market's 25%. This run includes stretches of sideways movement and even drops. DXCM's outperformance has remained during the past five years. As we mentioned at the outset, the stock had tumbled off its November 2021 peaks alongside nearly every growth-focused stock.DXCM is trading around 45% below its records at around $91 per share and it still has 23% more room to run before it hits its current average Zacks price target. And the stock has already made a bit of a comeback off its mid-June lows, up over 30%.DexCom is hardly what anyone would call cheap, but Wall Street is buying it for stellar value. DXCM shares have been impacted by rising interest rates, with investors not willing to pay up as much for future earnings with rates off their rock-bottom levels. DXCM has, in turn, been recalibrated. Its forward PEG ratio (P/E ratio divided by its growth rate) is back at 2.6 vs. its recent highs of a whopping 41.9. These levels put the stock not too far off its industry's 2.2 despite its huge outperformance.Bottom LineDexCom might not be the safest near-term play amid the uncertainty about the interest rate environment. Still, investors with long-term outlooks might want to consider starting a position in the diabetes-focused connected medical products company for its long-term upside.DexCom should benefit from the growing prevalence of diabetes and it could possibly expand into new areas of the connected health world given its strong balance sheet and rising cash position. Plus, 12 of the 14 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are ""Strong Buys.""Bear of the Day:Papa John's International is a pizza delivery powerhouse that's facing tough-to-compete against periods, a growing assortment of food delivery options, and other headwinds.Possible Pizza Fatigue?Papa John's is the world's third-largest pizza delivery company with over 5,500 restaurants in roughly 50 countries and territories. Papa John's competes against Domino's Pizza, other local chains, and higher-end places in the take-out pizza market.Papa John's and other companies benefited from the stay-at-home covid boost over the last few years, as well as a willingness from consumers to eat out during a period of economic growth and positivity.PZZA's earnings revisions have been trending in the wrong direction lately amid a shifting economic and consumer spending landscape. Papa John's executive team last quarter pointed to higher labor costs and commodity prices as a reason for its subdued outlook, alongside lower international sales, specifically ""softening economic conditions in the UK.""The pizza maker's FY22 and FY23 consensus estimates have dropped 6% and 7.5%, respectively over the last 60 days and slightly more if we go back a bit farther. Zacks estimates call for PZZA's 2022 revenue to climb by 2% and then pop around 5% in FY23. These estimates follow 14% revenue growth last year and 12% in FY20.Papa John's is projected to see its adjusted earnings slip by 15% in 2022 to $2.99 per share, before bouncing back to just under its FY21 total next year. The company's overall downward earnings estimate revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment.Bottom Line Papa John's shares have fallen over 40% in 2022 even as its broader industry dropped just 14%. PZZA's 2022 tumble roughly matches its rival Domino's, with Papa John's now down 9% over the last two years and DPZ 22% lower.Wall Street appears worried about the possibility of pizza delivery fatigue and the sustained challenges from many other restaurants who have found success through food delivery apps such as Uber Eats. All told, investors might want to stay away from Papa John's stock right now amid slowing consumer spending, high inflation, and growing non-pizza competition in the at-home delivery industry.Additional content:3 Stocks from the Growing Orthodontics Space in FocusThe pandemic-led crisis spanning two and a half years forced the dental industry to incline toward digital treatment options. The industry bore the brunt of the closure of dental practices and lower patient visits due to the risk of exposure to the virus and more focus on COVID-related treatments.However, digital orthodontics has been gaining traction lately. It offers advanced teeth straightening options while safeguarding dentists from the contagious virus.This subsegment of dental treatment entails the improvement of the arrangement and appearance of protruding, crowded or crooked teeth. It also pertains to correcting problems related to misaligned bites.Growing TrendGoing by a Fortune Business Insights report, the global clear aligners market size was $2.41 billion in 2020, exhibiting lower growth of 4.4% compared with the average year-over-year growth from 2017 to 2019.However, the market has experienced substantial recovery, primarily owing to the easing of restrictions and mass opening up of the economy in 2022. Apart from this, rising dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Robotics and teledentistry and an increase in the number of patient visits are likely to help the industry thrive in the near term.The latest technologies are helping orthodontic surgeons in carrying out minimally-invasive procedures that ensure precision and efficiency, thereby reducing patients' trauma. The industry players actively promote digital workflows for general dentistry and dental specialties. Further, dental 3D printers are revolutionizing dentistry. These reduce time and cost through efficient utilization of orthodontics and dental practices.Accordingly, going by the same report, this industry is projected to grow from $2.85 billion in 2021 to $10.04 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 19.7% in the forecast period 2021-2028.Orthodontics players like Align Technology, SmileDirectClub and DENTSPLY SIRONA are likely to gain from the changing opportunities within the orthodontic space.Stocks to WatchAlign Technology: In September 2022, Align introduced Invisalign Virtual Care AI, its next-generation remote monitoring solution with new artificial intelligence-assisted capabilities that streamline workflows for doctors and their staff. It has features like patient enrollment, setup, and review directly on the Invisalign Doctor Site without the need to use separate standalone solutions. Prior to this, the company announced its new Invisalign systems innovations for the Align Digital Platform. These latest innovations include ClinCheck Live Update for 3D controls, the Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personalized Plan, or IPP, and the Invisalign Smile Architect.In terms of 3D scanners, in the last-reported second quarter of 2022, the number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions reflected the continued adoption of digital scanners and a larger installed base. Total worldwide intraoral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q2 increased to 88.4% from 82.2% in the year-ago period.SmileDirectClub: Realizing the enormous prospects of this space, SmileDirectClub has extended its teledentistry platform to dental and orthodontic offices through a collaborative model, designed specifically for dentists who currently do not offer an orthodontic product to patients, and an office-directed model, designed for orthodontists and dentists as a traditional in-office clear aligner product.The company is currently providing a doctor-directed digital end-to-end experience in teledentistry, with 24/7 access to orthodontic care and the back end of a lifetime smile guarantee. The company continues to see favorable industry dynamics with broader acceptance of telehealth and specifically, teledentistry.The company continues to see growth in the adoption and use of teledentistry by the dental and orthodontic industries. This is further boosted by the expansion of the company's professional partnerships and well-established and respected national DSOs, which demonstrate the adoption of telehealth by the dental community.DENTSPLY SIRONA: In a bid to revolutionize digital-implant workflow in dental care, DENTSPLY's single tooth replacement solution — Azento — needs special mention. It revolutionizes the digital implant workflow by restructuring implant-planning service, purchase and delivery. Management remains optimistic about the long-term potential of the company's digital dentistry and workflow management as it is well positioned with respect to the diagnostic expertise of its X-ray portfolio, which is critical for implants.DENTSPLY has been witnessing a rising trend in dental offices, upgrading from 2D to 3D units, which has also been observed in all global markets. In the last fiscal, digital diagnostic devices like Primescan, Axeos and Orthophos delivered solid growth. In three years, the company scaled its clear aligners from having no presence in the digital diagnostic space to a business that delivered $274 million in 2021.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

268,fb543c37-ff99-3af5-b1e5-f684d5252b39,DVN,2022-10-06,Buy these 3 Energy Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-3-energy-stocks-001812682.html,1665015492,STORY,"['NEE', 'DVN']","[Many energy stocks had quite an amazing run over the last two years as oil and energy prices rebounded off their covid-induced lows.Crude Oil prices have climbed back to around $87 a barrel but are still well off their highs of $123.70 and the average closing price of $98.24 this year.While oil prices were bound for a correction, Oil and Energy is still the top-rated Zacks Sector, which might leave some investors wondering what to do with energy stocks.Let’s take a look at three top rated energy stocks for a better answer. Devon Energy DVNDevon Energy is an independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas.DVN’s stock has become increasingly popular over the last year because of the special dividend it has been paying while business booms. For the current quarter, DVN announced an extra dividend payment of $1.37 a share to go along with its regular $0.18 a share dividend.DVN currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its Oil and Gas–Exploration and Production Industry in the top 9% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Devon Energy’s earnings are expected to climb an impressive 162% to $9.24 a share in 2022, based on Zacks estimates. Fiscal 2023 calls for another 14% earning growth. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to jump 66% this year and another 1% in FY23 to $20.15 billion. DVN is up +60% year to date to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -21% and outperform its Zacks Subindustry and peer group at +43% and +48%, respectively. Even better, after the turnaround in oil prices, DVN is up +627% in the past two years to blast away the benchmark’s +13%. DVN has become an industry leader over the past two years as it also crushed its peer group’s stellar performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDevon Energy currently trades around $70 a share and roughly 10% off its 52-week highs. DVN has a forward P/E of 7.4X. This is slightly above the industry average of 5X but DVN’s earnings growth has solidified the company as an industry leader. Plus, it’s trading well below its high of 33.5X over the last two years and the median of 9.7X. This makes DVN attractive at current levels considering its performance during this time span.Story continuesNextEra Energy NEE Another Energy stock that is well known for its dividend is NextEra Energy (NEE). NEE is considered a Dividend Aristocrat after raising its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. NextEra Energy is a public utility company engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. NextEra has a good mix of solar and wind renewable energy capabilities as well.Investors may want to consider NEE stock because the company is not directly affected by the price of oil. However, as part of the Utilities sector, NEE is still poised to benefit from energy consumption. NEE’s Utility-Electric Power industry is also in the top 36% of 251 Zacks Industries.NextEra Energy is down -12% in 2022, but rising estimate revisions for this year and FY23 make the stock worth a look. NEE has a forward P/E of 28.6X, which is above the industry average of 17.7X. But from the nearby chart, we can see that NEE trades below its decade high of 36.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt is important to note that NEE is up +373% over the last 10 years, to crush the S&amp;P 500’s +174%. This has also blasted its Utility-Electric Power Markets +36%. This year’s dip in NEE may be a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.NEE earnings are expected to be up 13% this year and another 8% in FY23 at $3.13 a share. Sales are expected to rise 18% in 2022 and climb another 31% next year to $26.47 billion.NEE’s growth and reliable dividend are reasons investors may want to consider buying the stock. NEE has a 2.05% dividend yield at $1.70 a share. While its yield is lower than the industry average, investors can rely on the company to keep its dividend steady during high inflationary periods. NEE currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the average Zacks Price Target offers 16% upside from current levels.Schlumberger SLBSchlumberger (SLB) currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Schlumberger is a leading oilfield services company, providing services to oil and gas explorers, and producers across the world.Schlumberger helps locate oil and gas, drill, and evaluate hydrocarbon wells. SLB’s Oil and Gas-Field Services Industry is also in the top 9%.SLB’s YTD performance has been stellar at +39% to crush the benchmark and its peer group’s +9%. Even better, SLB is up +166% over the last two years to outperform the benchmark’s +13% and its peer group’s +116%. And the average Zacks Price Target offers 22% upside from its current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom its price performance, Schlumberger appears to be an industry leader, with its peer group consisting of other quality companies like Haliburton HAL and Baker Hughes BKR.This looks set to continue with earnings expected to climb 58% this year and another 37% in FY23 at $2.77 a share. Top line growth is expected to continue as well, with sales up 19% in 2022 and another 14% in FY23 to $31.24 billion.Trading around $41 a share, SLB has a forward P/E of 19.4X. This is near the industry average of 18.7X and well below its high of 36.7X over the last two years. SLB also trades below the median of 24.2X during this time span. Even better, SLB trades at an even bigger discount to its 10-year high of 152.5X. and the median of 24.9X.Bottom LineMany of the Industry leaders in the Oil and Gas Sector and the Utilities sector are still experiencing growth and offer generous dividends. These stocks can also help a portfolio during the current economic downturn and rising inflation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the equipment rental company had gained 0.75% over the past month. This has outpaced the Construction sector's loss of 1.81% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.29% in that time.United Rentals will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $8.88, up 34.95% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.06 billion, up 18.05% from the year-ago period.URI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $31.73 per share and revenue of $11.58 billion.

These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

UFPI has been benefiting from continuous improvements in Industrial and Construction units, its diverse end markets and strategic acquisitions to broaden its footprint. These tailwinds have been helping this Grand Rapids, MI-based wood and wood-alternative products manufacturer to navigate external challenges comprising rising interest rates and historically high inflation.Let’s take a look at the factors supporting the growth.Persistent Growth in Construction &amp; Industrial: During the second quarter of 2022, Construction segment sales were up 32% year over year. This improvement in the segment sales is mainly attributable to a 15% increase in selling price, a 15% rise in organic unit growth and 2% growth from the transfer of certain sales from the retail segment.The organic unit growth was driven by a 63% increase in commercial, a 35% increase in concrete forming and a 16% rise in factory-built housing. Meanwhile, the Industrial segment continues to perform well as PalletOne has been improving its sourcing and manufacturing and is expanding geographically within the UFP footprint.Again, the latest combination with Dempsey Forest Products provides added opportunity to create efficiencies in the supply chain. Instructional packaging or national sales team continues to gain business and drive more sales with national accounts.Strategic Buyouts: UFP Industries has been following a systematic inorganic strategy to expand market reach, boost profitability and strengthen its product portfolio. UFPI acquired nine companies in 2021 and five in 2020. Acquisitions contributed 24% to unit sales growth in 2021.In the first and second quarters of 2022, UFPI recorded a 7% and 1% increase, respectively, in unit sales from acquisitions. Acquisitions also contributed $12 million and $3.5 million to adjusted EBITDA and $10 million and $2.5 million to earnings, respectively, in the first and the second quarters.Diverse End-Markets: The company, which shares its space with Arcosa, Inc. ACA, United Rentals, Inc. URI and Dycom Industries, Inc. DY in the Zacks Construction sector, serves various end markets from more than 200 locations worldwide. This diversified approach has helped the company mitigate challenges through the years, including the latest new external risks like rising interest rates and high inflation.In the near term, the company expects continued improvement in the Industrial and Construction segments. It also expects more normalized demand in its largest segment, Retail Solutions. UFP Industries’ diversified business and end markets will likely successfully navigate various market environments and deliver impressive returns to shareholders.Story continuesA Brief Discussion on the Above-Mentioned StocksArcosa is a manufacturer of infrastructure-related products and services, serving construction, energy and transportation markets. The company is benefiting from a strong performance in Engineered Structures and Construction Products segments as well as growth in Transportation Products. Recent acquisitions and solid construction activities have been contributing to the upside.United Rentals has been benefiting from a broad-based recovery of activity across its end markets served.

Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison.Before restoring his original offer, Musk’s representatives held talks with Twitter on lowering the deal price, people familiar with the negotiations told Bloomberg News. Musk was seeking a price cut of 30%, and more recently explored a 10% discount, but the discussions failed to yield an agreement, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified sources.Delaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick said Wednesday that since neither side has yet asked to pause the case, she’s pressing ahead with the upcoming trial. In a securities filing earlier this week, Musk offered to go forward with the deal if Twitter’s suit was put on hold.Story continuesTwitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment after regular business hours on the deposition being delayed.Musk skipped out on other deposition dates in the case. He cancelled a Sept. 28 meeting to answer questions because of Covid-19 concerns, according to court filings. He also demanded that the deposition be conducted in Texas instead of Delaware.Musk backed away from his planned Twitter purchase earlier this year, claiming the company hadn’t leveled with him and investors about the number of bot accounts that artificially pump up advertising revenue. Twitter countered that the concerns were a pretext for Musk when he started feeling buyer’s remorse.In the past, Musk –- chief executive officer of electric-car maker Tesla Inc. -- has turned belligerent in pre-trial questioning in other court cases focused on his deal-making efforts.In a deposition tied to a suit by Tesla investors over Musk’s buyout of renewal-power company SolarCity, the billionaire belittled a lawyer for shareholders who argued the deal was rife with conflicts.“To bail out SolarCity was good for the world you’re telling us?” investors’ attorney Randy Baron asked in a pre-trial query.“Advancing solar is absolutely good for the world,” Musk shot back. “Do you just think about money? What is your purpose in life?” Musk’s deposition testimony was played in the 2021 trial of the SolarCity dispute.During his cross-examination at trial, Musk told a Delaware judge he didn’t respect Baron, who he considered to be “a bad human being” who specialized in asking deceptive questions. The judge ultimately ruled for Musk in the case.The case over the Twitter buyout is Twitter v.

The cyber security firm continues to win back-to-back deals for offering unique cyber safety solutions, which ensure the blocking of attacks or malicious content. It is currently focusing on selling more subscription-based services, which, in turn, are helping it to generate stable revenues while expanding margins.Palo Alto's subscription-based services like AutoFocus, Aperture, Traps, WildFire and Virtual are not only witnessing solid growth but also bolstering the customer base. We believe that the subscription-based business model will continue to improve the company’s top and bottom lines.Growing traction in Palo Alto's Prisma and Cortex offerings continues to act as a tailwind. In September, the company collaborated with the Bangalore-based technology firm, Infosys INFY, to secure a postal operator and e-commerce logistics provider, Bpost (Belgium Post)’s cloud environment by monitoring and utilizing advanced threat hunting capabilities through Infosys’ Cyber Next solution portfolio.Infosys implemented Palo Alto’s Cortex XSOAR solution, a comprehensive security orchestration, automation and response (“SOAR”) platform, to create robust cyber resilience for mail delivery and e-commerce logistics services of Bpost. Cortex XSOAR’s fully automated response playbooks and artificial intelligence-led predictions will protect Bpost from threats and strengthen its cloud security.Notably, Palo Alto’s acquisition of The Crypsis Group in 2020 strengthened its Cortex platform with expert services for incident response and proactive assurance.In May 2022, the company entered an agreement with Oracle Corporation's ORCL Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Network Firewall to integrate its VM-Series Next-Generation Firewall solution with Oracle Network Firewall for blocking threats and reducing risk breaches.Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure Network Firewall helps customers defend against emerging threats in their cloud adoption journey. With the unified network solution, customers can quickly turn on and secure their applications and cloud environment with Palo Alto’s firewall features and scale their security across their cloud deployment.In April, Palo Alto’s Internet of Things Security solution obtained ""Moderate Authorization"" status for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. This recognition highlights the trust that the U.S. government puts in PANW's standardized threat prevention and Zero Trust enforcement capabilities.Story continuesHowever, Palo Alto faces stiff competition from several big and small players in the security application market. Over the past couple of years, demand for IT security has been on a rise, driven by increased awareness about cyber attacks, making the market more attractive for new players. Established players like Cisco Systems CSCO are sparing no effort to position well in this intensely competitive space.In February, Cisco reportedly made a takeover offer worth more than $20 billion for software maker Splunk Inc. The potential deal is likely to combine Cisco’s strength in network security with Splunk’s strength in data-focused security operations, positioning it well in the security operations space. This deal could mark the networking giant’s biggest acquisition move, making it a daunting competitor for Palo Alto.In the last reported quarter, Palo Alto reported revenues of $1.60 billion. The top line, which grew 27% from the year-earlier reported figure, was aided by several deal wins and increased adoption of Palo Alto’s Next-Generation Security platforms due to the hybrid work culture and the need for stronger security.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Last month, he traveled to Ohio to speak at the site of Intel Corp's planned $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility.On Tuesday, Micron Technology said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a semiconductor fabrication facility in New York that is expected to create nearly 50,000 jobs, with the first phase investment of $20 billion planned this decade.White House National Economic Director Brian Deese on Twitter called the Micron investment ""a significant win for US economic &amp; national security"" and ""part of a deliberate, long term industrial strategy that will bolster U.S. competitiveness, &amp; increase our long-term productive capacity.""Biden will visit IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York site home to of the largest concentrations of quantum computers and will be joined by Chief Executive Arvind Krishna.IBM said it plans to make its Poughkeepsie site ""a global hub of the company's quantum computing development, just as it is today for mainframes.""

Both should have a challenging fundamental outlook (extremely so in the case of WDC) that he would argue discounted by current valuations.He continues to be Underweight on Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ: MU) ($49 price target), the closest comp to Hynix in his coverage, but with materially different trading patterns around the two stocks.In the long term, Micron has a healthy balance sheet and continues to execute well in product roadmaps and like-for-like price declines.Moore generally does not disagree with views that the company is in a strong position longer term.Challenges drive the cautious view he foresees in the next 12 months versus an optimistic consensus.Price Action: LRCX shares traded lower by 0.29% at $399.46 on the last check Wednesday.See more from BenzingaYMTC Ban Likely A Plus For Micron &amp; Western Digital, While A Minus For AMD &amp; NVIDIA, Analyst SaysSTMicroelectronics To Build Italy Chip Plant With Government Aid To Beef Up Its EV PresenceDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This comes as Intel recently broke ground on a new $20 billion factory in Ohio. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley has the details. That's a lot of money, Dan. A lot of money from Micron.DAN HOWLEY: It's a lot of money. The $20 billion that they're initially going forward with is to build a plant in upstate New York just outside of Syracuse. This is obviously a big deal because a lot of the discussion for the CHIPS Act was bringing manufacturing back to the US, away from the likes of China, Taiwan, just so that when there is some kind of issue, if there is some kind of issue like we saw with the pandemic, we still have access to these kinds of chips. So they're going to have this $20 billion plant. But they also said that they're willing to pledge up to $100 billion as the years go on.So this is a multi-decade kind of event that they're working through. And they're going to be building this plant specifically for memory chips. Don't forget Micron is a memory chip company. And though memory chips have been stung, you can see, obviously, their stock price down here. I mean, they're down along with the rest of the chip companies. Memory chips are still incredibly important. And as we put more chips into more devices, whether that's TVs, cars-- obviously, it's the big one that we talked about-- they're going to continue to see a need for these kinds of factories.So getting them into the US-- big, big deal. Getting them into upstate New York-- even bigger deal. GlobalFoundries has a few factories up there. IBM used to have a big facility. But you know, it's still an area where chip making works. And it's-- just as an aside, you can't just build these factories anywhere. They need to be on seismically stable ground. They have to--Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: That would help. That would help.DAN HOWLEY: You can't build them-- if there's any kind of rumbling or movement in the factory when they're trying to make these chips, you just ruined an entire batch. So it's-- the [INAUDIBLE].BRIAN SOZZI: Now I know why there's none on Long Island, so thank you.DAN HOWLEY: Exactly, yeah.BRAD SMITH: I was going to say, that's why it's not in Gowanus.BRIAN SOZZI: Sand, yeah. No, it's not in Gowanus.DAN HOWLEY: In Jersey, they just don't let you, so, you know.BRAD SMITH: Exactly. All right, so when we think about the number of jobs that this is potentially going to create, like, what are we talking about?DAN HOWLEY: They're talking about thousands of jobs up there. It could be as many as 10,000. As we see the progression go forward of these different stages-- again, this is the $20 billion at first, but they have pledged $100 billion. They're getting state incentives, obviously. That also is dependent on how many people they can hire, as well as different kind of environmental pledges to go forward.But I think this is something where when it comes to a local economy, especially in an area like Syracuse, like upstate New York, where manufacturing used to be big, and then we saw it drop off, and obviously, the local economy suffered, is that this is a good chance for a lot of people to potentially get jobs or for people to move in and get these jobs and kind of revitalize certain areas. And we'll see this across the country, right? We have Intel talking about Ohio. We have Samsung and TSMC, I believe they're talking about plants in Arizona, in Texas.So this is something that it's not just going to be a one-and-done kind of deal. This is something that I think we're going to see a lot more chip manufacturers come forward and say, we want to build. And this is-- I mean, part of this is because of the CHIPS Act, that there was a lot of pressure on companies to build here in the US. They got the incentives. And now they're basically starting to build this out.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, no, this is good to see. I'm looking forward to going to that Ohio plant, walk around Pat Gelsinger's.DAN HOWLEY: That would be wild.BRIAN SOZZI: [INAUDIBLE]. That's going to be cool. I'm waiting for the invite. Dan Howley, thanks so much.]"

(MU) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-micron-technology-130001521.html,1664974801,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has lost 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share, indicating a change of -74.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -107.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.88 points to a change of -65.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -36%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 indicates a change of +64.6% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -15.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $4.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -44.6%. The $21.46 billion and $27.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -30.2% and +26.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $6.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.7%. EPS of $1.45 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.03%. The EPS surprise was +3.57%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow finished up 825 points on yesterday's session, yet Hasbro stock barely finished up 2%. That lack of enthusiasm for Hasbro stock on such a hot day in the markets caught the attention of our Brian Sozzi. That's where we find his take today, in the toy aisles.BRIAN SOZZI: It darn right caught my attention. Now I have two levels of what I would call nuclear analysis. Nuclear level one would be my takes on Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and Sears in the past. Now this is level two, a little more toned down, but very critical, I think, of what Hasbro put up yesterday at its investor day, with its stock near a 52-week low and under considerable pressure for the past year because of various operating struggles and probably just not getting it done operationally, and also on several earnings calls.So here's what I got, my takeaway from what was a three-hour plus livestream presentation where they also happened to unleash their 2050 sustainability goals. First up here, full year revenue guidance slashed. So full year revenue guidance taken down by Hasbro. At the same time, they're pumping investors with 2027 targets and their sustainability goals for 2050. Next up, third quarter reported sales down 15%. So what does that mean? They dropped an earnings warning during this three-hour livestream presentation.Next, third quarter constant currency sales excluding-- which means excluding FX volatility, down 12%. Third quarter operating margin seen under pressure. Next up, operating profits interestingly seen up over 50% over the next three years, mostly driven by cost cuts, despite an economy that contracted in the first half of this year. In other words, I'm saying it's going to be very hard to hit that type of growth rate and with an economy under pressure and a lot of uncertainty out there ahead of the crucial fourth quarter holiday shopping season.Story continuesNext up here, I have 6 and 7. They put out 2027 sales target of $8 and 1/2 billion. Well, the Street for this year, they're estimating $6.5 billion. So they have a lot of sales, a lot of sales they're going to need between now and 2027 to reach that big goal. And along that same line, operating margin target of 20% by 2027 for Hasbro. They laid out the Street is estimating for this year 16.2%. So those are very, very big promises that Hasbro came up here-- came out there with yesterday.Now, here's what I'm hearing from various investors that I talked to on Hasbro. The outlook cut on Hasbro is holding more sway with investors near term. So we saw that a little bit yesterday with the market reaction, the stock only about 2% down after hours, seeing it under pressure here today. Investors more concerned about them cutting guidance and maybe not living up to expectations in the fourth quarter. Also, the 2027 targets look too optimistic, as you probably gathered from my tone around them.And here's some of my other analysis on Hasbro as we tie this all in a bow. Hasbro, at this point, is a ""show me"" story. Now, that is something echoed by the team at JPMorgan, who published a note on Hasbro this morning. I have that on the Yahoo Finance home page right now. There I am with My Little Pony. Big fan of My Little Pony, like My Little Pony.Stock is near a 52 low for a reason, or a series of reasons, for Hasbro. And then last but not least, why is Mattel's stock trading at a major PE discount to Hasbro? I encourage the market to just reflect a little bit on Hasbro. This is not the same Hasbro as it was three or four years ago.This is a struggling Hasbro and a Mattel that has been a full-on turnaround story under CEO, Ynon Kreiz, notably in that Barbie division and in the Hot Wheels division. And now they're going to start to come out with movies. I don't understand that disconnect. And my take here is very simple-- SMH. I'm shaking my head. I don't get it.BRAD SMITH: There would have to be a major, on the entertainment front, kind of a breakup of some of the deals that are already in place, or a winding down of the deals in place, on the entertainment front in order for them to capitalize on the toys that are typically annexed to any type of major movie title that comes out. Mattel has done so well at netting those partnerships. You've got to ask yourself, what does Hasbro see coming out in 2026 and 2027 that they would be able to capitalize on and net a big deal or partnership that allow them to sell through toys?BRIAN SOZZI: Fabulous point, Brad. I'll add this, too. We didn't get a lot of detail on them restructuring the E1 entertainment business. They bought that in 2019 for $4 billion. They teased that they might restructure that business over the summer. We didn't get a lot of details. Should have got them-- the market wanted it.BRAD SMITH: All right, that's Sozzi's take for today here in the toy category.]"

YUM is gaining from expansion efforts, strong comparable sales and Taco Bell growth. The company is also benefiting from the acceleration of its delivery services. However, high debt and costs are hurting the company.Growth DriversRobust same-store sales growth is aiding the company. During the second quarter, the company reported consolidated same-store sales (excluding China) growth of 6%. During the quarter, same-store sales at Taco Bell rose 8% year over year. The company has been benefiting from a recovery in emerging markets. Same-store sales for emerging markets (excluding China) were up 22% year over year. Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, the company anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.The company, which shares the space with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. CBRL, Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI and Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. PLAY, is focusing on expansion initiatives. During the second quarter of 2022, the company reported a solid year-to-date development pace, owing to contributions from emerging markets.The company opened more than 40 gross new units across China, India and the Middle East. It also opened 781 gross new units, including nearly 300 gross new units at Pizza Hut and 400 gross new units at KFC. Given the unit economics and a healthy development pipeline, the company anticipates achieving long-term growth of 4-5% in the upcoming periods.Taco Bell continues to impress investors with robust same-store sales. The company’s comps climbed 21%, 5% and 9% during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022, comps increased 5% year over year. The momentum continued in the second quarter of 2022, with Taco Bell comps increasing 8% year over year. Taco Bell recorded 46 gross new restaurant openings in second-quarter 2022. The company announced that it is focused on building momentum in different markets like the United Kingdom, Spain and India.Story continuesConcernsAn increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating costs such as rent and energy costs put significant pressure on the company’s margins. A competitive retail environment weighed on the restaurants’ costs. The company is susceptible to profit margin pressure due to relentless expansion. In second-quarter 2022, its net costs and expenses amounted to $1,082 million from $1,035 million in the prior-year quarter. Costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investments in initiatives are likely to weigh on margins in the near term.Maintaining liquidity has become an arduous task amid the coronavirus outbreak for most companies. At the end of Jun 30, 2022, the company’s long-term debt stood at $11,540 million compared with $11,332 million at the end of Mar 31, 2022. It ended second-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalent of $412 million compared with $365 million reported in the previous quarter.A Brief Review of the Other StocksCracker Barrel: The company has been benefiting from menu innovation, marketing strategies, seasonal promotions and cost-cutting efforts. Increased focus on the off-premise business model also bodes well. For fiscal 2022, the company plans to drive off-premise sales through awareness building, advertising and partnerships with third-party delivery companies. Further, it expects to attract new customers and drive sustained growth in its off-premise business through its virtual brand, Chicken and Biscuits.Darden: The company is gaining from business model enhancements and menu simplifications. This and a focus on technological enhancements in online ordering, the introduction of To Go capacity management, and the Curbside I'm Here notification bode well. Even though capacity restrictions continue to ease, off-premise sales remained strong during first-quarter fiscal 2023. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, off-premise sales contributed more than 24% to total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn and 13% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.Dave &amp; Buster's: The company is benefiting from a higher mix of amusements and a leaner operating model. It expects the momentum to continue on the back of its strategic initiatives, including a new menu, optimized marketing and technology investments.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And like the child Happy Meals, the special offering comes with a toy, as part of a collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market, a streetwear brand. The promotion runs until the end of the month.But while potential customers were excited about the special promotion—and the limited edition toys—McDonald’s employees were less enthusiastic about dealing with a rush of customers. “I can see the stress among my coworkers,” one employee told Kotaku. Employees are venting on social media, like TikTok and Reddit. “Y’all, please stop ordering these,” posted one employee on TikTok. Another employee wrote, “They going crazy with the adult Happy Meals,” over a video showing the number of Happy Meal orders.“New Adult Happy meals are killing me,” said one post on the McDonald’s employees subreddit.“We ran out of boxes the first day we had them, ran out of toys the second, and on the third day we had to say the truck doesn’t come till tomorrow,” wrote one commenter elsewhere on the subreddit. “It’s been…not fun.”TODAY -- Pictured: Al Roker, Sheinelle Jones and Craig Melvin on Tuesday, October 4, 2022 -- (Photo by: Nathan Congleton/NBC via Getty Images)McDonald’s did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment.This isn’t the first time a McDonald’s promotion has caused hassle for the staff.In 2017, McDonald’s revived its Szechuan dipping sauce for one day as part of a marketing exercise with Adult Swim show Rick and Morty. Desperate fans swarmed restaurants hoping to get some of the limited supply, leading to long lines, disruptive customers, and even calls to law enforcement. The chaos was worsened by poor communication from McDonald’s as to which restaurants were taking part in the promotion, meaning customers flocked to sauce-less restaurants.Customer chaos happened again in 2021, when McDonald’s revived its Pokémon Happy Meals, complete with collectible cards, to celebrate the video game franchise’s 25th anniversary. Unfortunately, the promotion occurred during a bubble in Pokémon trading cards, in which cards could be flipped for a 350-times return.Story continuesSome restaurants were forced to restrict sales of the Pokémon Happy meals to stop scalpers from buying up all the available Happy Meals and flipping the included trading cards on eBay.It’s not just McDonald’s. Last year, a tweet from a purported Starbucks employee went viral after the worker complained about customers adding too many modifiers to their drinks, leading to many other baristas complaining about the stress of completing similarly complex orders.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.45bUS$8.86bUS$9.17bUS$10.0bUS$10.7bUS$11.2bUS$11.7bUS$12.1bUS$12.5bUS$12.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.4%Est @ 5.06%Est @ 4.12%Est @ 3.47%Est @ 3.01%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$7.0kUS$7.8kUS$7.6kUS$7.7kUS$7.7kUS$7.6kUS$7.4kUS$7.2kUS$6.9kUS$6.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$74bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.7%– 1.9%) = US$274bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$274b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$143bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$217b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$239, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.124. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For McDonald's, we've put together three relevant aspects you should assess:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for McDonald's   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does MCD's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

291,11c16d69-1bf4-3496-a2bb-71d6b96aacab,PLD,2022-10-06,Investing in Prologis (NYSE:PLD) five years ago would have delivered you a 86% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-prologis-nyse-pld-five-110025010.html,1665054025,STORY,['PLD'],"[While Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 14% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been respectable. It's good to see the share price is up 63% in that time, better than its market return of 58%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Prologis To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Prologis achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Prologis the TSR over the last 5 years was 86%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Prologis returned a loss of 16% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 18%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Prologis better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Prologis  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The ESG survey was conducted in collaboration with the Global Centre on Healthcare and Urbanization at Kellogg College, University of Oxford, U.K. While the survey found that 98% of global business leaders cite ESG as a top factor in business success, only 25% of North American respondents think that prioritizing an ESG strategy will be an 'extremely important' focus by 2032, compared to 71% of their counterparts in the Asia-Pacific region and 58% in Europe.Protiviti logo. (PRNewsFoto/Protiviti) (PRNewsfoto/Protiviti)Every day we see more organizations setting long-term ESG goals, and these goals require clear roadmaps to achieve them.This 'enthusiasm gap' could indicate a majority of North American business leaders are out of step with other leaders globally in establishing and/or achieving ESG goals. Regarding environmental factors specifically, 37% of North American executives shared that they believe their corporate greenhouse gas emissions will decline by 2032, whereas Asia Pacific and European leaders were much more optimistic at 88% and 81%, respectively.""Every day we see more organizations setting long-term ESG goals, and these goals require clear roadmaps to achieve them. While there continue to be debate and different approaches to ESG, it's an important topic to many stakeholders. Organizations need to be clear about their goals and objectives for addressing ESG matters,"" said Cory Gunderson, executive vice president, Global Solutions, Protiviti. ""Our VISION by Protiviti research indicates that ESG will remain a focus within business strategies for most industry sectors over the next decade. However, many organizations – especially those in North America – appear to be in more of a 'wait and see' mode and may not be on track compared to their global peers.""Story continuesIn terms of spending on ESG, 64% of surveyed leaders globally expect an increase in corporate spending to manage environmental risks ten years from now. However, 61% of North American leaders report numbers that share a different reality, with responses indicating that their companies' spending for environmental concerns will remain the same or even decrease in ten years' time.Generational discrepancies also arose with the younger C-suite executives (those under the age of 50) indicating that ESG will become extremely important over the next decade (60%). Overall, almost three-quarters of respondents note their company has established a dedicated ESG or sustainability post or office.Adapting ESG Over the Next Ten Years Over three-fourths of business leaders surveyed (78%) believe that ESG reporting will become mandatory within ten years. Fewer than half of North American business leaders (49%) believe ESG reporting will become mandatory by 2032. The survey also found that consumer demand (42%) and regulatory requirements (39%) are expected to be the top two main drivers of change within the ESG space globally in the next 10 years.""ESG reporting is not an end in and of itself. It's a useful mechanism to shine light onto what companies are doing and the progress they're making toward their ESG goals,"" said Christopher Wright, global leader of Protiviti's Business Performance Improvement Solution. ""Continuing to instill reporting and compliance, be it mandatory or voluntary, into ongoing business processes will help companies progress their ESG strategy over the next decade.""Differences arise in tracking the extreme risks that companies are most worried about now and in the next decade. When assessing the highest amount of risk across the E, S and G currently facing their companies, 43% of business leaders cite the environmental factors, compared to 37% for social and 20% for governance. When asked what area within the ESG spectrum will pose the most 'extreme risk' in the next decade, 21% feel environmental factors, whereas 7% report they are extremely concerned about governance factors and 12% think social risks will be the most extreme risk by 2032. The ESG survey's respondents were 250 board members, C-suite executives and other global business leaders who work for public, private and non-profit organizations representing a wide range of industries. The survey was conducted in June and July 2022.Learn More About the Future of ESG – 2032 and beyondThe Protiviti-Oxford survey report, ""Executive Outlook on the Future of ESG, 2032 and Beyond"" is available for complimentary download (free subscription) at VISION by Protiviti.

The company is expected to report EPS of $2.85, up 5.17% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $24.39 billion, up 5.19% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.83 per share and revenue of $101.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +5.77% and +4.53%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Stephen Squeri, for US$8.6m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$144). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.American Express insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. American Express insiders own about US$124m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About American Express Insiders?The fact that there have been no American Express insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of American Express insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for American Express and we suggest you have a look.But note: American Express may not be the best stock to buy.

Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc also removed vaccine requirements for most of its U.S. offices.The move comes nearly a year after the New York-based company mandated full vaccination for U.S. employees working from office.Staff who test positive for COVID should submit a health form and stay at home until AmEx's medical office clears them, the memo said.The plans were first reported by Bloomberg News.(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

This company, which is in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This credit card issuer and global payments company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10.39%.For the most recent quarter, American Express was expected to post earnings of $2.37 per share, but it reported $2.57 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.44%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.43 per share, while it actually produced $2.73 per share, a surprise of 12.35%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for American Express lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.American Express currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.57%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 21, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With Mastercard’s solution, Android smartphones can double up as reliable payment acceptance devices for contactless cards, mobile wallets and smartwatches. Moreover, the smartphones acting as a physical point of sale require no added equipment or set-up expenses.If customers choose to pay through the PayContactless solution, they need to only touch a contactless card or a wearable on the merchant’s device. However, a consumer will be required to input the bank card PIN (known only to the cardholder) on the merchant’s phone only if the transaction value surpasses the verification limit for contactless payment permissible to the customer.Both small businesses and their customers are likely to benefit from the adoption of this new solution. Small business units will gain from seamless card payment acceptance capabilities. Similarly, along with businesses, consumers will be aided by a speedier and more secure checkout experience at stores.The latest partnership reflects Mastercard’s longstanding endeavor of infusing advanced digital solutions into the global payments landscape, thus bringing in more people and businesses under the ambit of a booming digital economy. As mobile phones become integral to our lives as a handy gadget, the MA solution that turns smartphones into payment acceptance devices seems to perfectly harness the teeming prospects in the worldwide digital payments space.Story continuesAlso, the expansion of Mastercard’s Tap on Phone solution throughout Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to strengthen its presence in the region that continues to witness a widespread uptake of digital technologies.The help extended by Mastercard to small businesses via the latest initiative is aptly timed. In an evolving digital era wherein businesses were compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, micro and small businesses grappled with inadequate resources and financial uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To bail such businesses out of crisis, Mastercard steadfastly partnered numerous well-established organizations, delivering several innovative digital payment solutions and pursuing significant investments.Like Mastercard, other companies making concerted efforts to cushion small businesses include American Express Company AXP, Visa Inc.

Also, strategic disciplines, impressive Aggregates business prospects, solid infrastructure investment and accretive buyouts are adding to the bliss.However, it has been grappling with supply chain issues and persistent rise in material prices and labor shortages. The Concrete and Aggregates players witnessed intense volatility in energy markets, continuous rise in diesel prices and higher liquid asphalt input costs.Supporting Growth FactorsSolid Residential &amp; Non-Residential Markets: Increasing public construction demand and a resurgence in demand on the private side, mainly residential, have been benefiting Vulcan and other industry players like Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Eagle Materials Inc. EXP. Even projects that were paused at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic have started executing on their backlog of projects.Vulcan has been witnessing strong pricing, underpinned by growing public demand (mainly transport) and operational discipline. Public sector construction includes federal, state and local government spending on constructing highways, bridges, airports, dams, roads and other infrastructure construction.On the federal front, the Senate’s approval of President Biden’s $1-trillion infrastructure plan in August 2021 is a significant growth driver for Vulcan. Continuous recovery in these fundamentals points to construction activity stabilization throughout 2022 and beyond.Private consumer demand also strengthened in the past year, especially residential construction. Privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 58% of total aggregate shipments in 2021. Residential construction continues to be the strongest end market, backed by growth in starts in both single-family and multifamily housing. There is pent-up demand for houses and new subdivisions driven by desirable mortgage rates and the desire to own a home.Long-Term Strategic Moves: The company remains focused on creating long-term value by compounding unit margins through four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — that enhance price growth and operating efficiencies. Higher price realizations and its four strategic initiatives should continue to increase unit profitability.Regardless of volume swings, the company intends to improve unit profitability in aggregates. Improvement in pricing, volumes and operating efficiencies helped it achieve 5% growth in unit profitability and 10% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in 2021. The trend continued in first-half 2022 as well. In the trailing 12 months period, adjusted EBITDA rose 13% despite the higher energy-related costs. Aggregates' cash gross profit per ton improved in 15 of the last 16 quarters, excluding the impact of selling-acquired inventory.Inorganic Drive: Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has followed a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that contributed significantly to its growth. In first-half 2022, the company acquired five aggregates facilities in Texas, and four ready-mixed concrete facilities and two idle ready-mixed concrete sites in Virginia for $233.5 million.In 2022, Vulcan expects to spend between $600 and $650 million on capital expenditures, including growth and capacity-adding projects. The company invested $465 million in 2021.Strong Aggregates Business: in second quarter, revenues from the segment increased 24.6% year over year, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) also increased 9% year over year (up 2% on a same-store basis). Strong demand and a positive pricing environment across the globe supported growth.For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales price inched up 9% (10% on a mix-adjusted basis) from the prior-year level. Freight-adjusted revenues also rose 18.6% from the prior-year quarter to $1,036.6 million.Story continuesIndustry Woes AilSince 2021, the company has been facing supply woes and inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and labor. Energy inflation was a significant headwind in 2021 and first-quarter 2022. Labor constraints have also caused delays and inefficiencies in operations. The company anticipates these headwinds to persist.The company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect operating results and profitability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could affect the company’s operating costs and the rising costs could erode profitability.Vulcan is susceptible to bad weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both the company’s ability to produce and distribute products and affects demand as construction work can be hampered by weather.A Brief Overview of Above-Mentioned StocksSummit Materials: The construction material company is based in Denver, CO. Migration activity amid the pandemic continues to favor rural and exurban markets. Additionally, the strong execution of its Elevate Summit strategy and higher average selling prices for aggregates have been aiding the company to drive growth. SUM remains focused on sustainable improvement via investments in green fields and end markets that are underpinned by sturdy growth fundamentals.Estimates for Summit Materials’ 2022 earnings indicate year-over-year growth of 24.1%.Martin Marietta: Based in Raleigh, NC, Martin Marietta produces and supplies construction aggregates as well as other heavy building materials — mainly cement — in the United States. Expanded infrastructure investment along with recovering private non-residential markets and heavy industrial projects of scale are expected to support near-term shipment levels. Also, the Lehigh West Region and Tiller buyouts will enhance its reach in new geographies for persistent industry-leading growth.Estimates for Martin Marietta’s 2022 earnings suggest year-over-year growth of 8.1%.Eagle Materials: This Dallas, TX-based company is benefiting from the improved cement, concrete and aggregates sales volume as well as the solid contribution from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement business. Higher pricing is adding to the positives.Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 suggest 24.9% year-over-year growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Tractor Supply (TSCO) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TSCO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Tractor Supply's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Tractor Supply's main business drivers.Headquartered in Brentwood, TN, Tractor Supply Company is the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the United States. The company focuses on recreational farmers and ranchers as well as tradesmen and small businesses. It offers a wide array of merchandise such as livestock, pet and animal products, maintenance products for agricultural and rural use, hardware and tools, lawn and garden power equipment, truck and towing products, and work apparel.Stores of Tractor Supply are primarily located in rural areas and the suburbs of major cities, which have inside selling space of 15,000–20,000 square feet with a similar area of outside space, used to demonstrate agricultural fencing, livestock equipment and horse stalls. Petsense stores have roughly 5,500 square feet of inside selling space. For Tractor Supply retail locations, the company has a standard design for the new built-to-suit locations, including nearly 15,500 square  feet  of  inside  selling  space.Tractor Supply’s broad assortment of products is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of its markets. Moreover, the retailer’s full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 16,000–19,500 unique products per store. Apart from selling nationally recognized branded merchandise, the company also markets an increasing list of products under its “private-label programs.” The latter include Masterhand and Job Smart (tools and tool chests), Dumor and Producers Pride (livestock feed) and Retriever and Paws ‘n Claws (pet foods). Further, the company recently acquired 100% stake in Petsense, to fortify its presence in the pet specialty space.Tractor Supply operates retail stores  under  the  names  Tractor Supply Company, Del’s Feed &amp; Farm Supply, and Petsense as well as operate websites under the names TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com.  Its online selling websites are  expected  to  offer  expanded  assortment of products beyond in-store as well as boost store traffic through buy online, pickup in-store and ship to store programs.As of Jun 25, 2022, it operated 2,016 Tractor Supply stores across 49 states and 178 Petsense stores in 23 states.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Tractor Supply ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $3,981.69, or a 298.17% gain, as of October 5, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 159.40% and the price of gold went up -6.91% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for TSCO.Shares of Tractor Supply have outpaced the industry in the past year on a robust sales trend that continued in second-quarter 2022. The company’s top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, marking the ninth straight quarter of sales beat. Meanwhile, the bottom line came in line. Both metrics grew year over year. Results have gained from strength in the Life Out Here Strategy and solid demand for its product categories. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comps growth. Its e-commerce business and Neighbor's Club loyalty program bode well. As a result, it raised the 2022 view. However, higher inflation, as well as rising transportation and freight, remains a headwind. Elevated costs, stemming from increased wage rates, also act as woes.The stock is up 5.24% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

308,46cc41a9-99f6-389d-8a03-eeede24339a3,MDLZ,2022-10-06,7 Consumer Stocks to Buy for Growth and Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-stocks-buy-growth-101555469.html,1664792155,STORY,"['MDLZ', 'ADM', 'HBB', 'COST', 'WHR', 'MED']","[This year’s market downturn has been brutal, even for steadier, less speculative stocks. With little sign concerns like inflation, interest rates, and a possible recession aren’t going away anytime soon, this trend could carry on in the months ahead. However, there is a silver lining. The 2022 bear market has created great opportunities among consumer stocks to buy.Pushed down to attractive valuations, and now sporting higher dividend yields, these stocks could provide solid long-term returns, in two ways. First, even it takes time for equities to get back into “bull market mode,” steady dividends from these names could result in a positive total return from your position.Second, oversold due to current “doom and gloom,” a combination of continued earnings growth, plus a market rebound, could result in gradual price appreciation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you are a long-term investor, now’s the time to add these seven consumer stocks to buy for your portfolio, all but one of which earn an “A” rating in my Dividend Grader.ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$80.45COSTCostco$472.27ETDEthan Allen Interiors$21.14HBBHamilton Beach Brands$11.67MDLZMondelez International$54.83MEDMedifast$108.36WHRWhirlpool$134.81Consumer Stocks to Buy: Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comIt may seem odd to consider Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) a “hard-hit” stock. Yet, while shares in this agribusiness giant are up 18.5% year-to-date, they have pulled back a fair amount since April.Earlier this year, ADM stock went on a tear, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The invasion caused a big jump in grain and other food commodity prices. During the quarter ending June 30, ADM’s earnings per share (or EPS) came in at $2.18, up 73% from the prior year’s quarter.Recession concerns recently have weighed on ADM. However, this may be a market overreaction. Shares today trade for 13.1 times 2023 estimated earnings, a low forward multiple. ADM stock, earning an A in Dividend Grader, has a forward dividend yield of 1.8%, with a nearly 30 year track record of dividend growth.Story continuesCostco (COST)Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock PriceSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comIn recent months, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares have been hit by a double-whammy. First, rising interest rates have put pressure on growth stocks valuations. Second, a sharp drop in consumer sentiment has led to the market shunning retail stocks.As a result, COST stock has fallen by around 17% this year. However, far from a warning sign, this sell-off gives you the opportunity to load up on a long-term winner while it finds itself out of favor among investors. As I’ve argued previously, this retail discount club operator is considerably more inflation and recession-resistant than its peers.Costco has historically been resilient during challenging economic times. This leaves shares well-positioned for a gradual comeback. COST typically isn’t viewed as a dividend stock, but earning a B rating in Dividend Grader, its modest payout (0.75% forward yield) has grown by an average of 12.8% over the past five years.Ethan Allen Interiors (ETD)Ethan Allen store exterior and logoSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comShares in Ethan Allen Interiors (NYSE:ETD) have fallen to rock-bottom prices. Anticipating a severe reversal in operating results, after the tailwinds resulting from the pandemic recovery, the market has pushed this manufacturer and retailer of home furnishes to a heavily discounted valuation making it one of the long-term consumer stocks to buy.Currently, ETD stock sells for just 7 times estimated earnings. Since the late 2000s, Ethan Allen has only briefly traded at such low multiples, typically trading for between 10 and 20 times earnings. With the potential to gradually rise to its historic valuation, ETD is also a great dividend stock opportunity.Earning an A rating in Dividend Grader, Ethan Allen shares currently offer a nearly 6% forward yield. Over the past five years, ETD’s dividend has gone up by an average of 10.5% per year. With a payout ratio of just 29.26%, there’s ample room for a further increase.Hamilton Beach Brands (HBB)Homepage of Hamilton BeachSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comHamilton Beach Brands (NYSE:HBB) is another familiar consumer name, now trading at a deep value price.Pessimism about near-term consumer spending has led the market to value shares in the home appliance maker at just 5.4 times estimated 2022 earnings.With the sell-side anticipating only a modest drop in EPS (from $2.10 to $1.75), investors could in time realize it was a mistake to send this stock down to the low-teens per share. Even if Hamilton Beach reports anemic growth from here, a valuation much higher than today’s multiple would be justified.Besides offering great value, HBB stock is a great opportunity for yield as well. Earning an A in Dividend Grader, the stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.69%. Hiking its quarterly dividend from 10 cents to 10.5 cents earlier this year, the coming years could bring additional modest payout increases.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a giant in the snack foods industry. Its portfolio of brands includes Cadbury, Oreo and Toblerone. Like other food stocks, shares have been hit hard by worries about the impact of inflationary pressure on its margins.Yet while inflation has put pressure on Mondelez’s performance, one analyst (Cowen’s Brian Holland) believes it’s been overdone. Furthermore, Holland argues the current valuation of MDLZ stock fails to reflect the company’s sales growth potential, as well as the potential for Mondelez to continue adding faster-growing brands to its portfolio, jettisoning the slower-growing ones.Trading for just 19.5 times earnings, there’s likely potential for multiple expansion if the market starts to agree with Holland’s arguments. In terms of its dividend, MDLZ stock earns an A in Dividend Grader. MDLZ stock has a 2.72% forward yield, and a 5-year track record of double-digit dividend growth.Medifast (MED)a bowl of vegetables, a green apple, and a measuring tape sit on a wooden tableSource: ShutterstockBenefiting from both pandemic and post-pandemic trends, weight-loss company Medifast (NYSE:MED) has experienced a big increase in sales and profitability since 2020. This led to a big increase in the price of its shares.Over the past year and a half, however, the stock’s performance has reversed course in a big way. After sliding in price for around a year management slashed guidance as a result of the company’s growth deceleration. Shares plunged on the news.Yet while the boom times may be over for now with Medifast’s business, there may be considerable upside for investors buying MED stock today.Shares trade for only 12 times estimated earnings, estimates that already account for the change in outlook. MED stock’s big drop has also made shares (earning an A in Dividend Grader) high-yielding. MED currently pays out $6.56 per share in dividends annually (6% forward yield).Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comTrends in 2021, including supply chain disruptions and the housing boom, were very favorable to Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).This year, however, the trends are clearly not in its favor. The appliance maker’s shares have been slammed, as inflation puts pressure on its margins, and rising interest rates/the economic slowdown curb demand.Still, while the company is feeling the squeeze, these headwinds may already be reflected in the price of WHR stock. Shares trade for only 6.2 times earnings estimates, providing plenty of buffer room if results fall far short of expectations. Whirlpool, earning an A in Dividend Grader, also remains a strong dividend stock.WHR stock has a forward yield of 5.09%. The company has raised its dividend eleven years in a row, with the dividend increases averaging 9.63% over the past five years. Whirlpool’s payout ratio (26.14%) leaves plenty more room for dividend growth.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ADM, COST and MDLZ.

(NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the world's leading brands, yet it stays relatively untouched by the effects of economic headwinds like inflation and global conflicts. However, the company needs to stay on its toes to account for higher freight costs and a slowing economy.As one of the most successful companies in the world, its shares remain stable and the company regularly pays out dividends and buys back shares. Because of this, it could be a good long-term investment that can be depended on to provide stable returns.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PEP. Click here to check it out. PEP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PEPPeter Lynch Chart of PEPPepsiCo is built to resist volatilityPepsiCo has built an ideal business model that can do well in any environment. It is a diversified food and beverage company with products ranging from soft drinks to snacks, including the Pepsi, Lay's, Doritos, Quaker Oats, 7Up, Tropicana, Gatorade and Aquafina brands.With a strong presence in both developed and emerging markets, the company's product mix is well-suited to the changing tastes of consumers worldwide. And Pepsi's efficient distribution system allows it to reach consumers in both rural and urban areas. It is also consistently innovating its products and marketing to keep up with the latest trends. As a result, the company is well-positioned to continue growing in the years ahead.It is also constantly expanding. For example, PepsiCo inked an agreement recently to purchase a 20% stake in French bottled spring water brand AQUA Carpatica. The company will distribute the water in Poland and Romania and will have the option to expand in other regions, including the U.S.According to data from Statista, sales will continue to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.95% from 2022 to 2026 in the soft drink market, which includes carbonated drinks, energy and sports drinks and non-carbonated drinks. PepsiCo is a major player in all three areas, so it should benefit from the growth.Story continuesThe company posted excellent numbers in 2020 and 2021, showing that Covid-19 had little impact on its performance. One can expect the company to further grow its sales in the coming years, especially with data supporting industry growth and the pandemic largely behind us.PepsiCo is widely considered a stable investment as it is built to resist volatility and does well during inflationary periods. The company's ability to weather economic storms has been one of the key factors in its consistent growth over the years. The company has a strong presence in both mature and emerging markets, which helps to insulate it from regional economic problems. In addition, it manufactures a wide range of products, giving it diversified revenue streams that help offset any potential losses. As a result, it has a reputation for being a safe investment for both individuals and institutions.Pepsi completed a huge milestone this yearCoca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi are some of the most iconic brands in the world. The two soft drink manufacturers have been trying to outdo each other for decades and are constantly fighting for market share. This rivalry often spills into the investment world as analysts and investors debate which is the better brand for their portfolio. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have a strong track record of delivering shareholder value. Coca-Cola is a diversified company with a presence in multiple categories, including bottled water, juices and coffee. On the other hand, Pepsi has focused its efforts on the snack food industry.During the pandemic, Pepsi swept past Coca-Cola and became more of an investor's favorite because it was able to weather the effects of the pandemic better. This was largely thanks to its snack division, which helped the company continue to make money even during this tough time.However, when judging Coca-Cola and Pepsi, there was one area where the former had a leg up on the latter: Coca-Cola is a dividend king. However, Pepsi became a dividend king this year, which means they are part of an elite group of public companies that have continually increased their shareholder dividends for at least the past 50 years.This track record of consistent dividend growth makes PepsiCo an appealing choice during market volatility when dividend payments can provide a much-needed source of stability.TakeawayPepsiCo is a world-renowned food and beverage company that offers many popular items. It also has a strong track record of profitability and shareholder returns.The company has performed well even during tough times and is poised to continue its success. It is a quality company with a strong brand that has delivered high shareholder value in the past. Plus, shares are affordable right now, too.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

DEO’s organic net sales were up 21.4% year over year in fiscal 2022. Recovery in the on-trade channel in North America and Europe, and the partial recovery in Travel Retail have been aiding the price/mix. The company’s positive mix also resulted from the robust performance of super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits.DEO’s margin trends were favorable in fiscal 2022, owing to its premiumization efforts, recovery in markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, which mostly offset the cost inflation. The company delivered £380 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, driven by COGS productivity and marketing effectiveness. The company’s operating profit improved 18.2% in fiscal 2022, driven by robust organic operating profit growth.Although Diageo expects the operating environment to be challenging in fiscal 2023, it remains confident in the resilience of its business and its ability to navigate through the headwinds.

However, the growth rate is likely to moderate from the fiscal 2022 level due to the robust on-trade recovery witnessed in fiscal 2022. It anticipates continued organic operating margin growth in fiscal 2023, driven by strong premiumization trends and operating leverage despite continued investment in marketing. It expects an effective interest rate of 3.5% for fiscal 2023.However, Diageo has been witnessing inflationary pressures, driven by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. Higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions, have been key headwinds. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales.DEO also remains susceptible to adverse currency rates. While the weakening of sterling against the U.S. dollar and some impacts of emerging market currencies look favorable, Diageo expects adverse currency impacts of hyperinflationary economies, primarily Turkey.Story continuesWrapping UpDiageo, which shares space with Constellation Brands STZ, Coca-Cola Company KO and PepsiCo Inc.

Inspired by the growing demand for hygiene products, the Lifebuoy brand of soaps was launched to ‘make health infectious’. 128 years later the Lifebuoy brand continues as a leading soap brand – albeit without the coal tar-derived ingredients list. In fact, the market research firm Kantar ranked Lifebuoy as the global #3 most chosen FMCG brand in 2020, just below Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate (CL) – an astonishing fact given the age of the brand. While the brand is largely absent from shelves here in the UK, it is a juggernaut in Asian markets, and is the #1 brand in India.There are two observations about the Lifebuoy story which tell us a lot about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), which is currently our largest holding in the Fund.The first is the enduring power of brands in the consumer goods market. According to Kantar’s list of most chosen brands, the top 20 global marques have an average age of 116 years, with over half being founded in the 19th century. Fashions come and go, but there is something special about low-cost consumable goods that advantages strong, time-worn brand names…” (Click here to view full text)11.

With little sign concerns like inflation, interest rates, and a possible recession aren’t going away anytime soon, this trend could carry on in the months ahead. However, there is a silver lining. The 2022 bear market has created great opportunities among consumer stocks to buy.Pushed down to attractive valuations, and now sporting higher dividend yields, these stocks could provide solid long-term returns, in two ways. First, even it takes time for equities to get back into “bull market mode,” steady dividends from these names could result in a positive total return from your position.Second, oversold due to current “doom and gloom,” a combination of continued earnings growth, plus a market rebound, could result in gradual price appreciation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you are a long-term investor, now’s the time to add these seven consumer stocks to buy for your portfolio, all but one of which earn an “A” rating in my Dividend Grader.ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$80.45COSTCostco$472.27ETDEthan Allen Interiors$21.14HBBHamilton Beach Brands$11.67MDLZMondelez International$54.83MEDMedifast$108.36WHRWhirlpool$134.81Consumer Stocks to Buy: Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comIt may seem odd to consider Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) a “hard-hit” stock. Yet, while shares in this agribusiness giant are up 18.5% year-to-date, they have pulled back a fair amount since April.Earlier this year, ADM stock went on a tear, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The invasion caused a big jump in grain and other food commodity prices. During the quarter ending June 30, ADM’s earnings per share (or EPS) came in at $2.18, up 73% from the prior year’s quarter.Recession concerns recently have weighed on ADM. However, this may be a market overreaction. Shares today trade for 13.1 times 2023 estimated earnings, a low forward multiple. ADM stock, earning an A in Dividend Grader, has a forward dividend yield of 1.8%, with a nearly 30 year track record of dividend growth.Story continuesCostco (COST)Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock PriceSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comIn recent months, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares have been hit by a double-whammy. First, rising interest rates have put pressure on growth stocks valuations. Second, a sharp drop in consumer sentiment has led to the market shunning retail stocks.As a result, COST stock has fallen by around 17% this year. However, far from a warning sign, this sell-off gives you the opportunity to load up on a long-term winner while it finds itself out of favor among investors. As I’ve argued previously, this retail discount club operator is considerably more inflation and recession-resistant than its peers.Costco has historically been resilient during challenging economic times. This leaves shares well-positioned for a gradual comeback. COST typically isn’t viewed as a dividend stock, but earning a B rating in Dividend Grader, its modest payout (0.75% forward yield) has grown by an average of 12.8% over the past five years.Ethan Allen Interiors (ETD)Ethan Allen store exterior and logoSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comShares in Ethan Allen Interiors (NYSE:ETD) have fallen to rock-bottom prices. Anticipating a severe reversal in operating results, after the tailwinds resulting from the pandemic recovery, the market has pushed this manufacturer and retailer of home furnishes to a heavily discounted valuation making it one of the long-term consumer stocks to buy.Currently, ETD stock sells for just 7 times estimated earnings. Since the late 2000s, Ethan Allen has only briefly traded at such low multiples, typically trading for between 10 and 20 times earnings. With the potential to gradually rise to its historic valuation, ETD is also a great dividend stock opportunity.Earning an A rating in Dividend Grader, Ethan Allen shares currently offer a nearly 6% forward yield. Over the past five years, ETD’s dividend has gone up by an average of 10.5% per year. With a payout ratio of just 29.26%, there’s ample room for a further increase.Hamilton Beach Brands (HBB)Homepage of Hamilton BeachSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comHamilton Beach Brands (NYSE:HBB) is another familiar consumer name, now trading at a deep value price.Pessimism about near-term consumer spending has led the market to value shares in the home appliance maker at just 5.4 times estimated 2022 earnings.With the sell-side anticipating only a modest drop in EPS (from $2.10 to $1.75), investors could in time realize it was a mistake to send this stock down to the low-teens per share. Even if Hamilton Beach reports anemic growth from here, a valuation much higher than today’s multiple would be justified.Besides offering great value, HBB stock is a great opportunity for yield as well. Earning an A in Dividend Grader, the stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.69%. Hiking its quarterly dividend from 10 cents to 10.5 cents earlier this year, the coming years could bring additional modest payout increases.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a giant in the snack foods industry. Its portfolio of brands includes Cadbury, Oreo and Toblerone. Like other food stocks, shares have been hit hard by worries about the impact of inflationary pressure on its margins.Yet while inflation has put pressure on Mondelez’s performance, one analyst (Cowen’s Brian Holland) believes it’s been overdone. Furthermore, Holland argues the current valuation of MDLZ stock fails to reflect the company’s sales growth potential, as well as the potential for Mondelez to continue adding faster-growing brands to its portfolio, jettisoning the slower-growing ones.Trading for just 19.5 times earnings, there’s likely potential for multiple expansion if the market starts to agree with Holland’s arguments. In terms of its dividend, MDLZ stock earns an A in Dividend Grader. MDLZ stock has a 2.72% forward yield, and a 5-year track record of double-digit dividend growth.Medifast (MED)a bowl of vegetables, a green apple, and a measuring tape sit on a wooden tableSource: ShutterstockBenefiting from both pandemic and post-pandemic trends, weight-loss company Medifast (NYSE:MED) has experienced a big increase in sales and profitability since 2020. This led to a big increase in the price of its shares.Over the past year and a half, however, the stock’s performance has reversed course in a big way. After sliding in price for around a year management slashed guidance as a result of the company’s growth deceleration. Shares plunged on the news.Yet while the boom times may be over for now with Medifast’s business, there may be considerable upside for investors buying MED stock today.Shares trade for only 12 times estimated earnings, estimates that already account for the change in outlook. MED stock’s big drop has also made shares (earning an A in Dividend Grader) high-yielding. MED currently pays out $6.56 per share in dividends annually (6% forward yield).Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comTrends in 2021, including supply chain disruptions and the housing boom, were very favorable to Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).This year, however, the trends are clearly not in its favor. The appliance maker’s shares have been slammed, as inflation puts pressure on its margins, and rising interest rates/the economic slowdown curb demand.Still, while the company is feeling the squeeze, these headwinds may already be reflected in the price of WHR stock. Shares trade for only 6.2 times earnings estimates, providing plenty of buffer room if results fall far short of expectations. Whirlpool, earning an A in Dividend Grader, also remains a strong dividend stock.WHR stock has a forward yield of 5.09%. The company has raised its dividend eleven years in a row, with the dividend increases averaging 9.63% over the past five years. Whirlpool’s payout ratio (26.14%) leaves plenty more room for dividend growth.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ADM, COST and MDLZ.

These crews include repair and construction resources, vegetation resources and other management personnel who have been using drones, airboats and other means to assess damage and help restore power to nearly all of the 2.6 million people left without electricity in the immediate aftermath of the storm.""Hurricane Ian was one of the most powerful storms to strike the U.S. in decades, with terrible winds, storm surge, rain and flooding. The hurricane left thousands of homes severely damaged and uninhabitable,"" said Sean Mahoney, Regional CEO, American Red Cross Southern California Region. ""Those impacted need help now, and this generous donation from Sempra will help the American Red Cross provide sheltering, meals and hope.

336,19d4f664-00c5-3e65-b9ae-2fd1193178cb,VMC,2022-10-06,"Solid Construction Activity Aid Vulcan (VMC), Inflation High",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solid-construction-activity-aid-vulcan-132401724.html,1664976241,STORY,"['VMC', 'MLM', 'SUM', 'EXP']","[Vulcan Materials Company VMC has been banking on solid demand in the residential and private non-residential construction activity and robust pricing actions. Also, strategic disciplines, impressive Aggregates business prospects, solid infrastructure investment and accretive buyouts are adding to the bliss.However, it has been grappling with supply chain issues and persistent rise in material prices and labor shortages. The Concrete and Aggregates players witnessed intense volatility in energy markets, continuous rise in diesel prices and higher liquid asphalt input costs.Supporting Growth FactorsSolid Residential &amp; Non-Residential Markets: Increasing public construction demand and a resurgence in demand on the private side, mainly residential, have been benefiting Vulcan and other industry players like Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Eagle Materials Inc. EXP. Even projects that were paused at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic have started executing on their backlog of projects.Vulcan has been witnessing strong pricing, underpinned by growing public demand (mainly transport) and operational discipline. Public sector construction includes federal, state and local government spending on constructing highways, bridges, airports, dams, roads and other infrastructure construction.On the federal front, the Senate’s approval of President Biden’s $1-trillion infrastructure plan in August 2021 is a significant growth driver for Vulcan. Continuous recovery in these fundamentals points to construction activity stabilization throughout 2022 and beyond.Private consumer demand also strengthened in the past year, especially residential construction. Privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 58% of total aggregate shipments in 2021. Residential construction continues to be the strongest end market, backed by growth in starts in both single-family and multifamily housing. There is pent-up demand for houses and new subdivisions driven by desirable mortgage rates and the desire to own a home.Long-Term Strategic Moves: The company remains focused on creating long-term value by compounding unit margins through four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — that enhance price growth and operating efficiencies. Higher price realizations and its four strategic initiatives should continue to increase unit profitability.Regardless of volume swings, the company intends to improve unit profitability in aggregates. Improvement in pricing, volumes and operating efficiencies helped it achieve 5% growth in unit profitability and 10% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in 2021. The trend continued in first-half 2022 as well. In the trailing 12 months period, adjusted EBITDA rose 13% despite the higher energy-related costs. Aggregates' cash gross profit per ton improved in 15 of the last 16 quarters, excluding the impact of selling-acquired inventory.Inorganic Drive: Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has followed a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that contributed significantly to its growth. In first-half 2022, the company acquired five aggregates facilities in Texas, and four ready-mixed concrete facilities and two idle ready-mixed concrete sites in Virginia for $233.5 million.In 2022, Vulcan expects to spend between $600 and $650 million on capital expenditures, including growth and capacity-adding projects. The company invested $465 million in 2021.Strong Aggregates Business: in second quarter, revenues from the segment increased 24.6% year over year, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) also increased 9% year over year (up 2% on a same-store basis). Strong demand and a positive pricing environment across the globe supported growth.For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales price inched up 9% (10% on a mix-adjusted basis) from the prior-year level. Freight-adjusted revenues also rose 18.6% from the prior-year quarter to $1,036.6 million.Story continuesIndustry Woes AilSince 2021, the company has been facing supply woes and inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and labor. Energy inflation was a significant headwind in 2021 and first-quarter 2022. Labor constraints have also caused delays and inefficiencies in operations. The company anticipates these headwinds to persist.The company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect operating results and profitability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could affect the company’s operating costs and the rising costs could erode profitability.Vulcan is susceptible to bad weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both the company’s ability to produce and distribute products and affects demand as construction work can be hampered by weather.A Brief Overview of Above-Mentioned StocksSummit Materials: The construction material company is based in Denver, CO. Migration activity amid the pandemic continues to favor rural and exurban markets. Additionally, the strong execution of its Elevate Summit strategy and higher average selling prices for aggregates have been aiding the company to drive growth. SUM remains focused on sustainable improvement via investments in green fields and end markets that are underpinned by sturdy growth fundamentals.Estimates for Summit Materials’ 2022 earnings indicate year-over-year growth of 24.1%.Martin Marietta: Based in Raleigh, NC, Martin Marietta produces and supplies construction aggregates as well as other heavy building materials — mainly cement — in the United States. Expanded infrastructure investment along with recovering private non-residential markets and heavy industrial projects of scale are expected to support near-term shipment levels. Also, the Lehigh West Region and Tiller buyouts will enhance its reach in new geographies for persistent industry-leading growth.Estimates for Martin Marietta’s 2022 earnings suggest year-over-year growth of 8.1%.Eagle Materials: This Dallas, TX-based company is benefiting from the improved cement, concrete and aggregates sales volume as well as the solid contribution from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement business. Higher pricing is adding to the positives.Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 suggest 24.9% year-over-year growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It also has plans to cut its onshore wind workforce at a later date in Europe and Asia Pacific.The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the onshore wind unit's workforce in the United States, they added. This would equate to hundreds of workers, one of the sources said.GE confirmed to Reuters it was ""streamlining"" its onshore wind business in response to market realities but did not comment directly on any workforce cuts.""These are difficult decisions, which do not reflect on our employees' dedication and hard work but are needed to ensure the business can compete and improve profitability over time,"" a GE Renewables spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Onshore wind is the largest of GE's renewable businesses, which together employed 38,000 people worldwide at the end of 2021. The unit, however, has been battling higher raw material costs due to inflation and supply-chain pressures.In the United States, which has been GE's most profitable onshore wind market, policy uncertainty following the expiry of renewable electricity production tax credits last year has hit customer demand, leading to a fall in the unit's revenue this year.GE is not alone. Heightened competition, supply disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring metals prices exacerbated by the war in Ukraine have made it difficult for wind turbine makers to generate profits even as governments and companies are calling for more renewable energy in the face of climate change.Rival Siemens Gamesa last month unveiled a plan to cut 2,900 jobs, mostly in Europe, after issuing a string of profit warnings this year. Profit at Danish wind turbine maker Vestas has also taken a hit.Story continuesThe troubles at GE's onshore wind unit, which accounted for 15% of the company's industrial sales last year, are also affecting the performance of its overall renewable energy business. In July, the company blamed its North American onshore wind business for two-thirds of the decline in its second quarter renewable revenue.While the restoration of the tax credit for wind projects is expected to give a boost to demand in North America, analysts expect GE's international onshore wind sales to remain challenged due to the high cost structure.GE has made turning around its onshore business a priority as it prepares to spin off its energy businesses, including renewables, into a separate company in 2024.As part of its efforts to improve profitability, the onshore business is trying to reduce fixed costs, which the company estimates could result in a couple of hundred million dollars of savings next year.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; editing by Richard Pullin)]"

The company is expected to report EPS of $0.51, down 10.53% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $19.04 billion, up 3.29% from the year-ago period.GE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.74 per share and revenue of $75.89 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +29.25% and +2.38%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Progressive. View our latest analysis for Progressive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Progressive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Progressive does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Progressive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Progressive is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ProgressiveThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Progressive Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$249m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Progressive   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

343,cabca078-2f17-34a8-b18f-7a80454e6ae0,VLO,2022-10-06,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-trending-130001607.html,1664974801,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $8.60 per share, indicating a change of +604.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.55 points to a change of +880.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.67 indicates a change of -35.9% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $42.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +42.7%. The $173.97 billion and $157.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +52.6% and -9.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $51.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +86.1%. EPS of $11.36 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +27.09%. The EPS surprise was +17.11%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

New deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings are helping the company to grow its profit levels and capture a bigger portion of the market.Further, an improving commercial business environment is likely to expedite its growth. With the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic slowly wearing off, its commercial business is expected to thrive. As the unemployment rate goes down, employers are buying more and more insurance products for their workers. UNH, with its wide range of product portfolio, is likely to face rising demand for its services.Thanks to its solid performance, UnitedHealth expects adjusted net earnings per share for 2022 to be within the $21.40-$21.90 band, up from the previous projection of $21.20-$21.70. The mid-point of the updated outlook suggests a 13.8% improvement from the 2021 figure. Notably, UNH beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.7%.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteIts health service business, Optum, is becoming increasingly valuable and is crucial to the company’s diversification strategy. The primary growth drivers for Optum are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services and international operations. Optum’s improved capabilities help UnitedHealth win new contracts.The company made an extensive collaboration with Walmart Inc. WMT, the renowned operator of retail, wholesale and E-commerce stores worldwide, with an initial aim to benefit Medicare beneficiaries. The deal will enable Optum to back clinicians at Walmart Health with analytics and decision support tools.UnitedHealth’s competitive product portfolio and efficient execution abilities enable it to win new government contracts. It was recently selected by the Department of Health and Human Services in Nebraska to manage the state's Medicaid program, Heritage Health. Along with UNH, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH were also chosen to administer the program.Story continuesUnitedHealthcare has been present in Nebraska for 26 years and employs more than 750 people in the state. The company has a network of 100 hospitals and over 14,000 physicians and caregivers in Nebraska. It serves more than 500,000 individuals in the state.UnitedHealth’s healthy balance sheet with strong financial flexibility, marked by consistent cash generated from operations over the years, enables it to take shareholder-friendly moves. This June, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 13.8%. Its dividend has grown at 17.6% per year for the past five years.The company’s long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to increase the dividend for the years to come. It has also been aggressively repurchasing shares. The company expects to buy back shares worth $5-6 billion this year.UNH's free cash flow, in the trailing 12-month period, increased 2.8% year over year to $20.5 billion. It expects operating cash flow for 2022 to be around $24 billion, marginally up from $22.3 billion in 2021.However, there are a few factors that can impede the stock’s growth potential.UnitedHealth’s rising operating expenses can affect its profit levels. The metric jumped 12.3% last year, primarily due to a rise in medical costs and operating costs. Even in the first half of 2022, the metric further escalated 13.7% year over year to $146.4 billion.Its global business is facing some headwinds. In 2019 and 2020, membership from its international business fell 8% and 5.2%, respectively. Although it witnessed a recovery in the membership figure last year, the same seems to be on a decline again, with a 0.4% year-over-year fall as of Jun 30, 2022.UnitedHealth is also grappling with significant interest expenses, which might weigh on the company’s margins. In the first half of 2022, interest expenses increased 11.5% from the year-ago period. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, UnitedHealth Group has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on UnitedHealth Group will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is UnitedHealth Group's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like UnitedHealth Group's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 27%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 44% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 15% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.6% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that UnitedHealth Group's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On UnitedHealth Group's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of UnitedHealth Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that you need to be mindful of.You might be able to find a better investment than UnitedHealth Group.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the healthcare industry, go directly to 5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To Invest In.Healthcare is one of the biggest sectors in the world. According to a research report, the healthcare consumer market size was $332.391 billion and is expected to reach $667.37 billion by 2028. In 2020, the healthcare sector accounted for 19.7% of the US GDP and the healthcare expenditure was about $4.1 trillion or $12,530 per person. According to Deloitte, the US healthcare expenditure is expected to more than double to $8.3 trillion in 2040.In the past year, the healthcare services industry has gained 7.7%, and its earnings are expected to grow by 14% annually. However, as of October 3, the sector has declined by 1.3% in the last week. At the time of writing, the industry is trading at a 24.6x PE ratio compared to the 3-year average of 22.2x.When talking about healthcare stocks, large companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) steal the spotlight. However, in this article, we will discuss the cheap healthcare stocks in these times of inflation and global economic headwinds.Photo by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash Our MethodologyAfter a careful assessment of the healthcare sector, we picked these stocks based on their fundamentals, financial strength, analyst ratings, and dividend history. All of the stocks mentioned in the article are priced below $35 as of October 3.The hedge fund sentiment around some of the stocks has also been added which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds at the end of Q2 2022.11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To Invest In11. AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL)Price as of October 3: $10.25AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) is a Canadian biotechnology company that operates an AI-powered antibody discovery platform. As of the second quarter of 2022, 17 hedge funds had a stake in the company. Baker Bros. Advisors is the most prominent shareholder. The fund owned over 10.45 million shares, worth $111.29 million.Story continuesAbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) is one of the best health stocks due to its multiple revenue streams. The company generates revenues through optional investment shares,  licensing, milestone payments, and research fees. However, the largest revenue stream is generated through royalties from successful drugs. Currently, the company maintains approximately 74% gross margins and close to 40% net profit margins. Additionally, the mid-cap company holds $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no debt as of the latest June quarter.On August 10, Credit Suisse analyst Tiago Fauth maintained an Outperform rating on AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL)’s shares and lowered the price target to $34 from $40. The analyst mentioned that the company added six programs under contract and started discovery on an additional four, which brings up the cumulative program starts to 88.AbCellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) is an affordable stock unlike expensive names like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).10. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG)Price as of October 3: $15.51Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) is a Dutch medical devices company. It operates through three segments; diagnosis and treatment, connected care, and personal health.Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) is one of the best healthcare stocks because of its strong focus on shareholder returns. The company pays dividends annually and as of October 3, the company has a yield of 5.88%. The next estimated dividend payout date is June 9, 2023. However, it has to be kept in mind that the Netherlands has a dividend withholding tax of 15% which lowers the dividend yield due to the dilution of shares as the shareholders prefer their dividends in form of shares rather than cash. Nonetheless, the company consistently repurchases its outstanding shares and has spent $5 billion on share repurchases since 2017.Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) is also a good addition to investor portfolios as it has penetrated a market with obstructed entrance. The company has only two other competitors and has steady subscription services for some of its products, generating some strong recurring revenues for the company.On September 12, Societe Generale analyst Delphine Le Louet upgraded Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) shares to Buy from Hold and lowered the price target to EUR 21 from EUR 22.40. The analyst believes that the company’s current share price “more than discounts the bad news.”Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“In the health care sector, our biggest detractor was Philips. Philips was a Q3 purchase. After exiting more consumer-focused businesses such as TV and lighting over the past decade, Philips has become a health care technology company operating across three main areas: diagnosis and treatment, connected care, and personal health. Shares came under pressure due to a recall of its first-generation CPAP machine for sleep apnea and fears regarding potential litigation. This created our opportunity to get involved. However, following our initial purchase, shares fell further in November after the FDA provided an update on the device recall and delineated deficiencies identified from an inspection of the device’s main manufacturing facility, which in itself is not unusual. Investors’ key sources of concern likely center around the recall expanding to additional products, the potential for legal recourse, and potential market share losses arising in the sleep division. Nonetheless, the sleep division is a small part of the overall business—which we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues. This is a sticky business as medical providers are reluctant to switch over to competitors. We believe shares have been overly penalized, so we added to our position on weakness.”9. Abcam plc (NASDAQ:ABCM)Price as of October 3: $15.68Abcam plc (NASDAQ:ABCM) is a UK-based company that focuses on the production and distribution of protein research tools. The company identifies, develops, and distributes tools for scientific research, diagnostics, and drug discovery.Abcam plc (NASDAQ:ABCM) is one of the best healthcare stocks due to its healthy growth in recent years.

(NASDAQ:EXEL) holds a healthy balance sheet because of its portfolio of drugs. The company has a cash position of $2 billion after $100 million was added in the latest June quarter.

Its sales have been growing for 7 consecutive quarters and is experiencing market share improvements sequentially. The TKI had a 37% market share in Q2 2022.

(NASDAQ:EXEL)’s shares and raised the price target to $26 from $24. According to the analyst, the recent results of the company were a low-quality beat and the unchanged guidance reflects a growth outlook for 2H22.7. R1 RCM Inc.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

351,c10714e7-e33b-3fb9-9e28-e3619369cc8a,ADP,2022-10-06,Companies no longer fighting ‘tooth and nail’ for workers: ADP chief economist,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/companies-no-longer-fighting-tooth-144756135.html,1664981276,VIDEO,['ADP'],"[ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the ADP private payrolls jobs report, the uptick in labor force participation, wage gains, and the outlook for the labor market and the economy.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: The ADP National Employment report showed 208,000 jobs were created in September, way down as the economy grapples with higher interest rates stemming from the Fed's efforts around bringing down inflation. Joining us now for more on the labor market picture is ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. Nela, great to get some time with you. So a little bit better than expected read on employment. How do you think that will show up on Friday when we get that jobs report?NELA RICHARDSON: Hi, Brian. Great to be with you. I think what you're seeing is a slight rebound in the number of people coming back into the labor market. The Friday jobs report that we'll see will tell us if this trend continues. Remember, last month, the BLS reported that there was a tick up in the labor force participation rate. And that tickup led to some stronger hiring in September.And we saw that play out in the private snapshot that we provided this morning. 208,000 jobs created mainly from the service sector really driven by retail, trade, utilities, professional business services, leisure, hospitality, education, and healthcare. These services hit hard by the pandemic, rebounding as schools continue to be fully operational. We can't take that for granted that health concerns have waned, and that we're seeing that fiscal fade lead people to come back to the labor market. So all of these things added up to pretty steady job gains. If they continue, we expect that steadiness to also continue.BRAD SMITH: What did we learn about some of the wage levels for those who were kind of changing jobs, looking for new positions, were able to get into those new roles?NELA RICHARDSON: It's an excellent question. I think that's the most significant part of this report. For the first time in the series, this new series that we've released, we saw a deceleration in annual pay growth for job changers. Now, why is this notable? Well, job changers are more sensitive in their pay to current job conditions. And that deceleration means that companies are not competing as much, not tooth and nail, in terms of wages to attract workers to get them to switch their jobs.Story continuesAnd so, going from 6.2% annual pay growth last month, 15.7% in September was notable to us. And it shows that maybe wages won't be that big driver of inflation in the future. And if you match that with the million-- about a million lower postings in job postings that the BLS released this week, you see some loosening in labor market conditions that may continue.BRIAN SOZZI: Nela, the goods producing sector part of the report lost 29,000 jobs. Is that number-- what is causing that, in your view? And is that recessionary?NELA RICHARDSON: The manufacturing has been really solid throughout this whole period of time, as you know, that shift in spending from goods. What it signals to us is the effect of higher interest rates. When you think of the industries that make up the sector-- housing, construction, manufacturing-- they are the most interest rate sensitive of the economy.So that pickup in the federal funds rate translates to what you saw in terms of some weakness and survey data, especially coming from the homebuilders. And that could lead to some hiring freezes over time as firms in that industry assess supply chain shortages, which continue to be a factor, higher interest rates, and again, getting people back into those jobs. So it's a conflation of a lot of things, but interest rates certainly is a factor.BRAD SMITH: Nela, if we back out the education and health services adds of 38,000, what type of picture does that really paint for us, given the cyclicality of that and how we're trying to add to this broader context what may actually take place in the broader employment economy, where jobs need to still kind of be able to, on the wage side, hold up against some of the inflation that still has not totally been combated, at least from the Fed's perspective right now?NELA RICHARDSON: Right, so two ways to answer your question. One, we expect that wage gains on a month to month basis will slow. The economy has reached over that 2019 level of employment. We're starting to see a more normalization, a normalized pace of growth going forward. We are unlikely to see a half a million new jobs produced every month. In fact, we'll get something much more consistent with historical trends, especially given the overall slowdown in the economy.I think, secondly, what you're seeing is in terms of pay. I think you're seeing that normalize as well. So this is more consistent with a steadier economy. The question is, how much of a slowdown are we going to expect as the Federal Reserve continues to be very focused on driving down inflation, higher interest rates, and holding them higher for longer? The bottom line for the worker is that wage gains, though they're strong-- 7.8% reported in September by us-- they are not keeping up with inflation. So on the Street, people are actually losing ground this year from where they were last year.BRIAN SOZZI: Nela, we just had a guest on that assigned a 70% chance of a recession next year. If that were to happen, is the economy still creating jobs? Do we still get payrolls reports that are in the positive column?NELA RICHARDSON: That would be the weirdest recession ever if we had a slowdown and still job creation. But let's not eliminate that from what could happen. I think what's more likely than an outright recession in real growth is a-- excuse me, a nominal growth-- is an economy that continues to see slower but nominal growth, but real growth actually declining. And in that scenario, I think you could see some job gains.But it's going to be a tricky path forward. Everyone has acknowledged that. Stagflation is not something that people have been talking about. It's more recession. But stagflation should certainly be on the table where we still see high inflation higher than that 2% target and an economy that is stagnating. Not necessarily declining, but not seeing the kind of growth that we all expect, given the strength in the labor market that we're seeing right now.BRAD SMITH: All right, a huge week in the assessment of employment here in the US. Nela Richardson, we know you're getting a phone call right now. We'll let you go. ADP chief economist there. You're in high demand. You're in high demand.

We've got some new job numb-- jobs numbers for the month of September from within the ADP Employment Report. The economy added 208,000 jobs in September, according to the report. This ahead of Friday's Non-Farm Payrolls Report, one that will be closely watched for signs of what the Fed-- Federal Reserve may or may not do with respect to interest rates.And Brad, interesting to see. And this is gonna continue, I think, a theme we have been seeing in the market since that ISM report a couple of days ago, the manufacturing report, that any sign of good news in the economy, this market is going to sell off. And as soon as we got that ADP report, we saw a next leg lower in stock futures.Now, anything over 200,000, I would say, is pretty solid. But the market doesn't want to see that. They probably wanted to see-- I think some of these investors that have bid up stocks the past two days, close to 6% on the S&amp;P 500, they wanted something under 100,000. And they didn't get it.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And it was entirely noteworthy, too, that the entire goods-producing, holistic sector was actually down by about 29,000 jobs, negative 29,000 jobs. So 29,000 jobs lost in the private payrolls there in the goods-producing sector, and largely from natural resources and mining, and manufacturing.But for those sectors that are still producing jobs at this point in time, in the service-providing part of this equation, you've got transportation, trade, and utilities bringing in the most job ads. Net adds of 147,000 jobs there. Another gainer that we saw, professional business services. And then more cyclical, education and health services. Some of the other sectors that continue to watch going forward from here, too.BRIAN SOZZI: Glad you mentioned the goods-producing. So those jobs down 29,000. Declines in natural resources and mining. Declines in manufacturing. I think that dovetails nicely with what we just got in GDP. The economy contracted in the first half of this year.Story continuesAnd you saw a lot of manufacturing companies pull back. You've seen companies like a FedEx come out here and warn, if the market-- you know, if the bulls were looking for something to hang their hat on, that's your bad data point. So maybe ignore that headline number and look at that goods-producing data.To me, that suggests everything we've been seeing that has been hammering the stock market or hammered the stock market in September, that is the effect of the strong dollar. That has the effect of higher rates. That is the effect of the consumer starting to feel more stress on their household budget. It is that goods-producing part of this ADP report.BRAD SMITH: One of the notes in this report, ""While job growth is stable, it remains below the recent three-month average."" That's particularly noteworthy. We're gonna get even more on that later on during today's show with Nela Richardson, who is the ADP chief economist. Gonna join us to break down some of these numbers and really what it sets up, even going into the Friday BLS report as well on the holistic employment situation front here in the US.BRIAN SOZZI: Big day indeed.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely.]"

Net sales of $4,484 million increased 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. On an organic basis, the company’s sales advanced 9%. This marked the 14th successive quarter of organic sales growth, with improvements in all divisions and categories.The company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well. This led to double-digit organic sales growth in its oral care business in the second quarter of 2022.Some notable efforts include the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, the Hello Products LLC buyout, and a partnership with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate.The company is aggressively expanding the geographic footprint of its brands, along with enhancing distribution to faster growth channels. It has expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. Its professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — are performing well in spas and dermatology clinics.Colgate also expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. It is gaining from strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Its Hill's business continues to witness sales momentum, with sales growth of 14.5% in the second quarter and organic sales growth of 18%. Results have gained from a 5.5% increase in unit volumes (both reported and organic) and 12.5% pricing growth, offset by a 3.5% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States, Europe and Australia/New Zealand.Strength in oral care and pet nutrition remain the key growth drivers. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate also remains focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Driven by the above-mentioned factors, management anticipates 2022 net sales growth toward the higher end of its previously mentioned 1-4% growth. Organic sales are expected to increase 5-7% compared with 4-6% growth mentioned earlier.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeThe company has been reeling under higher raw material and logistics costs worldwide, which dented the bottom-line performance in second-quarter 2022. Despite the earnings beat in second-quarter 2022, Colgate’s Base Business’s (adjusted non-GAAP) earnings of 72 cents per share declined 10% from the prior-year quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings declined 13% to 72 cents per share in the quarter under review. Adjusted earnings for 2022 are projected to decline in the mid-single digits.Also, the rise in advertising investments remains concerning. For 2022, advertising investments are expected to increase year over year on both GAAP and adjusted basis. This is likely to hurt the gross margin on both GAAP and adjusted basis for 2022. It expects $1.3 billion in raw material and packaging inflation, along with higher logistic costs, for 2022.Some other staples companies facing the heat due to higher freight costs are Procter &amp; Gamble PG, The Clorox Company CLX and Church &amp; Dwight CHD.Procter &amp; Gamble has been reeling under higher commodity and freight costs based on the current industry dynamics. PG’s fiscal 2022 earnings view includes an after-tax headwind of $2.3 billion from higher commodity costs and higher freight costs.Commodity and freight costs are likely to hurt fiscal 2022 EPS by $1.33 per share on a combined basis. Procter &amp; Gamble expects the impacts of the headwinds to be more pronounced in the first half of fiscal 2023.Clorox has been witnessing elevated manufacturing and logistics costs, and higher commodity costs. Also, record-high input cost inflation remains concerning.Going into fiscal 2023, Clorox expects cost inflation of $400 million, including commodities, transportation and wage inflation. CLX expects fiscal 2023 to remain challenging due to input cost inflation, supply-chain disruptions and the lapping of COVID-19 impacts.Church &amp; Dwight’s increased raw material, manufacturing and distribution costs are deterrents. CHD expects to face inflation at a greater rate than effective price increases in 2022.On its second-quarter earnings call, Church &amp; Dwight expected to witness additional cost inflation of $135 million for 2022. The incremental inflation is mainly associated with raw and packaging materials and the pass-through of similar costs from third-party manufacturers.ConclusionWe believe that Colgate’s strategic efforts, including product innovation, brand strength and expansion plans, will help offset cost headwinds.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the past years, companies in the US are steadily raising their dividends to send a positive signal to analysts and investors. According to a research paper published by Cass Business School, 59.1% of US companies raised their dividends over the period 2000 to 2012. The paper further mentioned that 81% of the S&amp;P 500 companies paid dividends in 2012 and 68% of them increased their payouts that year.This year, dividend stocks are again in demand as inflation in the US reached its 40-year high. Dividend stocks have historically proved to be inflation-fighting investments as these securities have outperformed other asset classes. Since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation, reported WSJ. The report also mentioned, citing S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Bureau of Economic Analysis data, that dividends now represent 7.3% of personal income, compared with 3.2% in 1980. Dividend companies that continuously raise their payouts are on investors’ radars as they help them grow their income over time. Some of the best dividend stocks in this context are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). These companies have not only raised their dividends for decades but are also outperforming the broader index this year.Dividend growers have dominated the overall market return since 1994. According to a report by ClearBridge Investments, dividend growers delivered an annual average return of 11.1% in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 to Q3 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend growers with strong balance sheets and solid financial health.

At the company level, we hold select companies in pharmaceuticals, healthcare services and health insurance at attractive valuations. This is at a time when the average age of the U.S. population is fast approaching 40, older than Asia-Pacific and a little younger than the aged populations of Europe and Japan. The number of seniors in the U.S.—i.e., 65 years or older— now surpasses 54 million, or about 15% of the population. Seniors, on average, take a much greater number of medications and account for a large and disproportionate share of healthcare spending, and we expect that trend to continue due to both raw demographics and a proliferation in the number of available treatments and services available now, the latter being driven by innovation and investment in the healthcare industry. Representative holdings in the Fund include Cigna, United Health Group, Viatris and Quest Diagnostics.”8.

Edward Sicher said ""Boeing needs to proceed with installing modern crew alerting systems on these aircraft to mitigate pilot startle-effect and confusion during complex, compound system malfunctions.""The FAA declined to comment. Boeing, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said it is safer to have one common cockpit alerting system for all versions of the 737.Reuters reported on Monday that Boeing does not anticipate winning regulatory approval for its 737 MAX 10 before next summer, according to an FAA letter to Congress.Last week, Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, proposed extending the deadline for Boeing to win approval for the two new variants until September 2024 and hopes to attach the proposal to an annual defense bill.There is no indication yet if Wicker's proposal has the support of other key lawmakers including committee chair Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat. Cantwell's office did not immediately comment.The requirements were adopted as part of a certification reform bill passed after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people and led to the best-selling plane's 20-month grounding.Relatives of many of those killed in the MAX crashes also oppose giving Boeing an extension. They wrote a letter in July opposing the extension and suggest Boeing had resorted ""to bullying Congress.""Sicher said the pilots union did not agree ""with Boeing’s claim that pilots could become confused when moving from an airplane without the modern alert system to one that is equipped with it. Nothing could be further from our flight deck reality.""(Reporting by David ShepardsonEditing by Chris Reese and Marguerita Choy)]"

The application currently before the California Coastal Commission calls for development of ocean slant wells to supply a 6.4 million gallon per day desalination plant. The company is proposing a multi-phase plan to develop needed water supplies with the first phase of the desalination facility producing 4.8 million gallons per day.""The Monterey Peninsula has been in need of additional drought-proof, reliable water supplies for over 25 years,"" said Ian Crooks, Vice President of Engineering for California American Water. ""Building the first phase of MPWSP will protect the Carmel River ecosystem and create a drought-proof new water supply for our service area.""California American Water has been conducting extensive outreach to customers, local officials and residents throughout Monterey County. Efforts have included 10 public workshops since August as well as individual meetings and presentations to interested stakeholders. Feedback on the project has highlighted community support for a drought-proof water supply that will allow for new housing construction and support economic development. It has also illuminated the benefits of a flexible phased approach to start the project that can ultimately accommodate future needs and provide opportunity for regional public participation when additional supplies are needed in California American Water’s service area or elsewhere in the region.The desalination facility will include a system of ocean slant wells constructed on a former industrial sand mining site to draw unusable seawater, deliver that saline water to a desalination plant located in Monterey County, and send desalinated water directly to the Monterey Peninsula for municipal uses within California American Water’s service area. Ocean slant wells are the preferred method to obtain water for desalination since they draw ocean water from beneath the coastal subsurface, which avoids harm to the environment and marine life. Reducing the initial size of the facility will limit the number of ocean slant wells needed at this time and help control construction costs while ensuring that the project can accommodate future water resource needs.Story continues""Phasing the MPWSP strikes the right balance to meet the critical need for sufficient and reliable drought-proof water supply to meet demands in the near term while allowing for additional supply as it becomes needed over the next 30 years,"" said Crooks. ""In addition, as we heard from the community, phasing the project with the possibility of expanding the project to accommodate future regional water supply needs through public participation is important. This is a win-win for the region that provides an opportunity to help MPWSP be part of future water supply solutions for our customers and nearby communities.""Due to historic water shortages caused by mandated reductions in the use of the Carmel River and made worse by historic drought conditions, a building moratorium has been in place on the Monterey Peninsula, resulting in job loss and limited housing for people in the region.About California American Water: California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 725,000 people.

(NYSE:FCX) Shares Could Be 25% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-nyse-fcx-121622500.html,1664972182,STORY,['FCX'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.35bUS$5.89bUS$4.59bUS$3.88bUS$3.49bUS$3.26bUS$3.13bUS$3.06bUS$3.03bUS$3.02bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ -15.4%Est @ -10.2%Est @ -6.56%Est @ -4.01%Est @ -2.22%Est @ -0.97%Est @ -0.1% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$4.1kUS$5.1kUS$3.7kUS$3.0kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.0b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.0%– 1.9%) = US$61bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$61b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$31bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$59b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$30.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Freeport-McMoRan as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.191. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

367,d30a9e31-23b3-34b1-bb15-e00de27f9c37,PEP,2022-10-06,Those who invested in PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) five years ago are up 72%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-pepsico-nasdaq-pep-110015363.html,1665054015,STORY,['PEP'],"[Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) share price is up 49% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Also positive is the 7.1% share price rise over the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, PepsiCo achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.1% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 8% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PepsiCo has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think PepsiCo will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, PepsiCo's TSR for the last 5 years was 72%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that PepsiCo has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 10% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 12% a year, is even better. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the world's leading brands, yet it stays relatively untouched by the effects of economic headwinds like inflation and global conflicts. However, the company needs to stay on its toes to account for higher freight costs and a slowing economy.As one of the most successful companies in the world, its shares remain stable and the company regularly pays out dividends and buys back shares. Because of this, it could be a good long-term investment that can be depended on to provide stable returns.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PEP. Click here to check it out. PEP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PEPPeter Lynch Chart of PEPPepsiCo is built to resist volatilityPepsiCo has built an ideal business model that can do well in any environment. It is a diversified food and beverage company with products ranging from soft drinks to snacks, including the Pepsi, Lay's, Doritos, Quaker Oats, 7Up, Tropicana, Gatorade and Aquafina brands.With a strong presence in both developed and emerging markets, the company's product mix is well-suited to the changing tastes of consumers worldwide. And Pepsi's efficient distribution system allows it to reach consumers in both rural and urban areas. It is also consistently innovating its products and marketing to keep up with the latest trends. As a result, the company is well-positioned to continue growing in the years ahead.It is also constantly expanding. For example, PepsiCo inked an agreement recently to purchase a 20% stake in French bottled spring water brand AQUA Carpatica. The company will distribute the water in Poland and Romania and will have the option to expand in other regions, including the U.S.According to data from Statista, sales will continue to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.95% from 2022 to 2026 in the soft drink market, which includes carbonated drinks, energy and sports drinks and non-carbonated drinks. PepsiCo is a major player in all three areas, so it should benefit from the growth.Story continuesThe company posted excellent numbers in 2020 and 2021, showing that Covid-19 had little impact on its performance. One can expect the company to further grow its sales in the coming years, especially with data supporting industry growth and the pandemic largely behind us.PepsiCo is widely considered a stable investment as it is built to resist volatility and does well during inflationary periods. The company's ability to weather economic storms has been one of the key factors in its consistent growth over the years. The company has a strong presence in both mature and emerging markets, which helps to insulate it from regional economic problems. In addition, it manufactures a wide range of products, giving it diversified revenue streams that help offset any potential losses. As a result, it has a reputation for being a safe investment for both individuals and institutions.Pepsi completed a huge milestone this yearCoca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi are some of the most iconic brands in the world. The two soft drink manufacturers have been trying to outdo each other for decades and are constantly fighting for market share. This rivalry often spills into the investment world as analysts and investors debate which is the better brand for their portfolio. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have a strong track record of delivering shareholder value. Coca-Cola is a diversified company with a presence in multiple categories, including bottled water, juices and coffee. On the other hand, Pepsi has focused its efforts on the snack food industry.During the pandemic, Pepsi swept past Coca-Cola and became more of an investor's favorite because it was able to weather the effects of the pandemic better. This was largely thanks to its snack division, which helped the company continue to make money even during this tough time.However, when judging Coca-Cola and Pepsi, there was one area where the former had a leg up on the latter: Coca-Cola is a dividend king. However, Pepsi became a dividend king this year, which means they are part of an elite group of public companies that have continually increased their shareholder dividends for at least the past 50 years.This track record of consistent dividend growth makes PepsiCo an appealing choice during market volatility when dividend payments can provide a much-needed source of stability.TakeawayPepsiCo is a world-renowned food and beverage company that offers many popular items. It also has a strong track record of profitability and shareholder returns.The company has performed well even during tough times and is poised to continue its success. It is a quality company with a strong brand that has delivered high shareholder value in the past. Plus, shares are affordable right now, too.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It is worth considering PepsiCo (PEP), which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry.This food and beverage company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.77%.For the last reported quarter, PepsiCo came out with earnings of $1.86 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 per share, representing a surprise of 7.51%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.29 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.03%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for PepsiCo. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PepsiCo currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.47%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 12, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Diageo expects to invest strongly in marketing and innovation, and leverage its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support the company’s momentum in the near and long terms.The company has been benefitting from a sustained recovery in the on-trade channel, strong consumer demand in the off-trade channel and market share gains.Diageo is anticipated to retain the strong business momentum on continued premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends, particularly in the spirits category. DEO’s organic net sales were up 21.4% year over year in fiscal 2022. Recovery in the on-trade channel in North America and Europe, and the partial recovery in Travel Retail have been aiding the price/mix. The company’s positive mix also resulted from the robust performance of super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits.DEO’s margin trends were favorable in fiscal 2022, owing to its premiumization efforts, recovery in markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, which mostly offset the cost inflation. The company delivered £380 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, driven by COGS productivity and marketing effectiveness. The company’s operating profit improved 18.2% in fiscal 2022, driven by robust organic operating profit growth.Although Diageo expects the operating environment to be challenging in fiscal 2023, it remains confident in the resilience of its business and its ability to navigate through the headwinds. The company is confident about the long-term growth potential of the total beverage alcohol sector and expects to expand its value share by 50% in the sector to 6% by 2030.Diageo is on track to deliver on its medium-term guidance for fiscal 2023-2025, wherein it targets organic sales growth of 5-7% and organic operating profit rise of 6-9%.For fiscal 2023, the company expects net sales growth across North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. However, the growth rate is likely to moderate from the fiscal 2022 level due to the robust on-trade recovery witnessed in fiscal 2022. It anticipates continued organic operating margin growth in fiscal 2023, driven by strong premiumization trends and operating leverage despite continued investment in marketing. It expects an effective interest rate of 3.5% for fiscal 2023.However, Diageo has been witnessing inflationary pressures, driven by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. Higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions, have been key headwinds. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales.DEO also remains susceptible to adverse currency rates. While the weakening of sterling against the U.S. dollar and some impacts of emerging market currencies look favorable, Diageo expects adverse currency impacts of hyperinflationary economies, primarily Turkey.Story continuesWrapping UpDiageo, which shares space with Constellation Brands STZ, Coca-Cola Company KO and PepsiCo Inc. PEP, has been gaining strength from premiumization, innovation and digital initiatives.A Synopsis of Other StocksConstellation Brands reported the third straight quarter of an earnings and sales beat in first-quarter fiscal 2023.

372,a20a35b5-9918-3824-8b4d-a638589c86d3,PEP,2022-10-06,PepsiCo (PEP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-pep-earnings-expected-grow-140002707.html,1664978402,STORY,['PEP'],"[The market expects PepsiCo (PEP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 12, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.8%.Revenues are expected to be $20.85 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.36% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo?For PepsiCo, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.47%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that PepsiCo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of $1.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.86, delivering a surprise of +7.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PepsiCo appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

373,b8bf50da-9bbc-38b0-acc2-6f97eaa44098,REGN,2022-10-06,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:REGN) three-year earnings growth trails the 37% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-regn-three-130132851.html,1664974892,STORY,['REGN'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) share price is 159% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! It's also up 27% in about a month.Since the stock has added US$4.8b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share growth of 41% per year. We note that the 37% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. This observation indicates that the market's attitude to the business hasn't changed all that much. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals   you should know about.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

374,83e2fa06-ff4e-3c66-932c-a47991c5fb6a,DGX,2022-10-06,Legal cannabis poses a quandary for US companies screening staff for drugs,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/legal-cannabis-poses-quandary-us-100848782.html,1665050928,STORY,['DGX'],"[By Timothy Aeppel(Reuters) -Workers at Wyatt Bassett's furniture factory in Virginia use powerful tools to churn out the company's trademark dressers and headboards, so screening new hires for drugs is a no-brainer.Or it used to be.Virginia last year fully legalized marijuana — the first state in the South to do so. The upshot is that ""being positive for cannabis does not necessarily disqualify you for employment,"" said Bassett, CEO of Vaughan-Bassett Furniture Co., which has 575 employees.On Thursday, President Joe Biden issued an executive order aimed at reshaping how the federal government treats cannabis.The shift in policy should aid many companies. Faced with a shortfall in applicants, employers across the U.S. are balancing pressure to ease up on testing for a legal drug with concerns that this could impact safety and raise issues of liability.The U.S. jobless rate ticked up to 3.7% last month, but it remains near a five-decade low.""With the war for talent and the labor shortage, especially in some lower paying jobs, it's tough to find and retain folks — so many are deciding to not test, except for safety sensitive jobs,"" said Julie Schweber, a senior knowledge adviser at the Society for Human Resource Management. Companies with multiple operations in different parts of the country face an added challenge, she said, because laws differ from state to state.Biden's order on Thursday grants a pardon for all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. He also announced a review of how cannabis is ""scheduled,"" or classified, under federal law. The current schedule places it in the same class as heroin and LSD and in a higher classification than fentanyl and methamphetamine.The challenge of balancing workplace safety and the growing prevalence — and legalization — of some types of drugs is especially acute for manufacturers and others who use dangerous equipment.Story continuesLast June, Amazon.com Inc. said positive tests for marijuana use would no longer disqualify people from jobs that are not regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, such as truck drivers.The e-commerce giant — like many other employers — said it will treat cannabis like alcohol, even though traces of its use linger in the human body far longer and can show up on some types of tests after a worker is no longer impaired by its use. ""We will continue to do impairment checks on the job and will test for all drugs and alcohol after any incident,"" wrote former-CEO Dave Clark, in a blog post at the time of the announcement.Data from Quest Diagnostics, which handles testing for companies, shows a steady increase in positivity rates for marijuana tests over the past decade — coinciding with the wave of legalization. In 2012, only 1.9% of workers not subject to federally mandated drug testing requirements failed a pre-employment screening. Last year, that had grown to 4.1%. The jump in positive tests after accidents grew even more during that period, up from 2.4% to 6.7%.The majority of Fortune 1000 companies have some type of screening in place, but many companies are dropping cannabis tests from the list, said Barry Sample, a senior science consultant who compiles Quest's data. Still, Quest estimates between 30 to 35 million employment-related drug tests are conducted in the U.S. annually.Most of the tests Quest conducts use urine samples. Other tests rely on swabbing saliva or hair samples. ""None of this testing can say whether someone is impaired,"" said Sample. Rather, the tests will simply indicate the presence of the drug based on a pre-set threshold.Cannabis use for medical reasons is now legal in 37 states, while recreational use is legal in 19. Quest's data also shows that states that allow recreational use of cannabis have higher positivity rates.Sample said many employers are shifting screening efforts to focus on drugs that remain illegal and where use in some industries also appears on the upswing. In manufacturing, for instance, Quest found the positivity rate clicked up last year for both methamphetamine and cocaine.Insurance experts say it is too early to see if the changes will drive up insurance rates for companies that drop testing. ""Nobody is going to come out and say, 'We're increasing premiums because you have more stoned workers on the job,'"" said Mark Pew, a consultant who specializes in workers' compensation insurance in Georgia. But if, over time, companies that have looser drug screening policies have higher accident rates than those who stick to tougher rules, that could change, he said.Matt Zender, a senior vice president for workers' compensation strategy with AmTrust Financial Services Inc., said one factor that may obscure or offset the impact of more drug use on the job is the general move toward safer workplaces.""If you just look at claims per 100 hours of work, overall people are getting injured less often than they were in the past,"" he said.Meanwhile, companies continue to fine tune their approaches on the issue. A California manufacturer of plastic bags, contacted by Reuters about their drug screening policies, was surprised to learn that his human resources department was automatically rejecting applicants who test positive for cannabis.""My nephew would never get a job if I enforced that on him,"" Kevin Kelly, CEO of Emerald Packaging Inc. in Union City, Calif., said in an email. He said he had now directed his hiring managers to drop the requirement, adding that workers at the factory are not allowed to be impaired on the job. Cannabis use is fully legal in California.(Reporting by Timothy Aeppel in New YorkEditing by Claudia Parsons)]"

This is certainly proving to be the case this year. With all the major U.S. indices now in bear markets, many stocks that were flying high during the pandemic are getting crushed under the weight of poor financial results, bad management and flawed strategies. Since U.S. interest rates are likely to stay elevated for some time, those equities will probably keep getting crushed for the foreseeable future. For investors looking to avoid getting badly hurt by those names, here are seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell before they die.MRNAModerna$121METAMeta Platforms$137.67GMGeneral Motors$33.21NFLXNetflix$236SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$79GPSThe Gap$8.50PTONPeleton$7.40S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Sell: Moderna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comEighteen months ago, Boston-based pharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) was the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500. From the time the pandemic hit in March 2020 to September 2021, MRNA stock ran up an incredible 2,038%, soaring from $21.30 to $449.38 per share.Investors who held Moderna stock throughout the development and commercialization of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine reaped massive returns. But now the stock has suffered a brutal reversal of fortune. Since peaking in September of last year, the share price has collapsed 70%, and it now trades at $121 a share, making it one of the worst performers in the benchmark index.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe demise of MRNA stock can be chalked up to one issue: the company does not have a robust pipeline of drugs in development beyond its coronavirus vaccine. While Moderna was one of the first companies in the world to get its Covid-19 vaccine approved, it does not have a diverse lineup of other medications to help drive its revenue higher.Story continuesAs a result, Wall Street views Moderna as a one-trick pony. As the sales growth of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine slows, the question has become: What’s next? Until Moderna answers that question, investors can expect its stock to continue sliding lower.Meta Platforms (META)META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comA recent headline on CNBC summed up the situation being endured by Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): “Facebook scrambles to escape stock’s death spiral as users flee, sales drop.”The article highlights that META stock is trading at its lowest level in three years and is one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 this year, as it has tumbled 60% since January. This morning, the shares are trading at $137.67 a share.The article also details a litany of problems at the company, ranging from declining online advertising revenue to growing competition from social media sites such as TikTok,. Meta also has internal difficulties due to its focus on the Metaverse.It all adds up to a doom-and-gloom scenario for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the shareholders who have stood by as the company underwent a brand transformation late last year. Meanwhile, Meta continues to face a barrage of criticism over the misinformation that has spread on its social media platforms.While Meta Platforms continues to earn the bulk of its revenue from online ads, the company is working double time to shift its core business to virtual reality headsets and other technology needed to create the Metaverse. Whether the switch will be successful is a multi-billion dollar question that is weighing heavily on META stock.General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLike most automakers, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is in the process of electrifying its vehicle fleet. The legendary Detroit automaker has allocated $35 billion to the development of electric vehicles through 2025.In addition to churning out electric models of popular vehicles such as the Chevy Blazer sport utility vehicle and even a fully electric Hummer, General Motors is also developing several EV battery plants across the U.S. All of these initiatives are aimed at catching market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and keeping pace with archrival Ford (NYSE:F). Yet the performance of GM stock suggests that the electric revolution is not going that well at General Motors.In 2022, GM stock is down 44% at $32.88 per share. While most auto stocks have tumbled this year along with the broader market, investors have sold off GM stock particularly hard.One of the big reasons for the selloff is that the company continues to face a shortage of parts as it is having difficulty obtaining them. This has hurt GM’s earnings and has disappointed investors on both Wall Street and Main Street.Most recently, General Motors reported earnings per share of $1.14, compared to the EPS of $1.20 that analysts, on average, had forecast. The supply chain problems and poor earnings have cast a shadow over GM’s big electrification push and raised doubts in the minds of investors.Although I still hold GM stock due to my position being deeply underwater, I believe other investors should sell shares now, if possible, because the near-term challenges facing the company are just too great.Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comAfter a decade of dominance, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is no longer the top streaming platform. That title now belongs to the Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS).This has led to a crisis at NFLX whose name was synonymous with streaming movies and TV shows not that long ago. Facing a glut of competition, Netflix is taking steps to diversify and bolster its revenue stream, from pushing into video games to launching a new tier for streaming that includes advertising. The company is taking the latter step even though it long said that it would never do so. So far, the efforts have not stopped the erosion of Netflix’s subscriber base, which is down by more than 1 million households this year.Prior to this year, it had been more than a decade since Netflix reported a net loss of subscribers. News of the loss has sent investors screaming for the exits. After climbing relentlessly during the pandemic, NFLX stock hit a peak of $700 a share in October 2021.Since then, the share price has fallen 66% to $236. At one point, the stock was down to a 52-week low of $162.71. Can the stock recover even though Netflix’s sector is suddenly crowded with competition?The jury is out. But Netflix continues to invest heavily in new content, announcing that it is spending $17 billion on programming this year alone. Its rival, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is spending $15 billion on streaming content.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)A photo of a sledgehammer on an asphalt surface.Source: goldleviza / Shutterstock.comAnother S&amp;P 500 stock to sell before it dies is Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK). While investors don’t hear as much about this stock as the others on this list, the tool maker  has fallen on hard times. The company went gangbusters during the pandemic as homeowners upgraded their houses while sheltering in place. But after running up 177% between March 2020 and May 2021, SWK stock peaked at $219 a share and has been steadily deflating ever since. Having fallen 60% this year, Stanley Black &amp; Decker stock is now trading at $79 per share, lower than where it was when Covid-19 first hit.The company just announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs in its finance department to help lower its costs as its outlook darkens. The company has said its earnings are being negatively impacted by not only a decline in home renovation projects, but also by rising interest rates and inflation that are leading to a slowdown in overall consumer spending on its power tools.Consequently, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has announced that it is planning to cut up to $200 million of costs by year’s end. The company has about 70,000 employees worldwide.The Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockRetailers are another category of stocks that have taken it on the chin this year. But few retail stocks have taken as hard a knock as The Gap (NYSE:GPS).Down 55% on the year and now trading under $9 a share, GPS stock ended 2021 trading right around $25. The massive retreat has been due to a combination of bloated inventories and poor sales at both The Gap and its sister chain, Old Navy. The San Francisco-based company also recently announced a round of job cuts, trimming 500 positions from its corporate ranks. The layoffs came after the company’s CEO, Sonia Syngal, abruptly stepped down in July.The negative news at The Gap was also amplified recently with the announcement that singer Kanye West prematurely ended his promotional deal with the clothing and apparel retailer.This would be a lot for any company to endure in a year. But most of this drama has occurred at The Gap over the summer. Where the company goes from here is not clear. But its reputation with consumers and investors has taken a big hit, and confidence in the company’s management team is low.With inflation remaining stubbornly high at more than 7% and interest rates expected to continue rising in coming months, don’t expect GPS stock to recover anytime soon.Peloton (PTON)Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefrontSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCan Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) survive? If there’s one company on this list that is in real danger of disappearing, it is the internet- connected maker of treadmills and exercise bikes. So far this year, PTON stock has cratered 80% and now trades at under $8 a share. The company is barely keeping its head above the $5 penny stock threshold.At its pandemic peak, Peloton’s stock was trading near $165 a share. But as gyms and fitness centers reopened and people gave up their subscriptions to Peloton’s online fitness classes that they were using at home, the company’s earnings and stock have imploded.Of course, Peloton is trying to recover. The New York City-based company has hired a new executive team and switched its strategy from focusing on sales of treadmills and bikes to concentrating more on monthly subscriptions to its online classes.Most recently, Peloton announced a deal with retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) to sell its equipment in Dick’s more than 850 outlets across the U.S. The deal marks the first time that Peloton has joined forces with a brick-and-mortar retailer, diversifying its sales approach from strictly online channels.The company has also struck a deal to place its exercise bikes in all 5,400 Hilton (NYSE:HLT)-branded hotels in the U.S.Despite these efforts, the question remains whether it is too little, too late for PTON stock.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GM and DIS.

The cyber security firm continues to win back-to-back deals for offering unique cyber safety solutions, which ensure the blocking of attacks or malicious content. It is currently focusing on selling more subscription-based services, which, in turn, are helping it to generate stable revenues while expanding margins.Palo Alto's subscription-based services like AutoFocus, Aperture, Traps, WildFire and Virtual are not only witnessing solid growth but also bolstering the customer base. We believe that the subscription-based business model will continue to improve the company’s top and bottom lines.Growing traction in Palo Alto's Prisma and Cortex offerings continues to act as a tailwind. In September, the company collaborated with the Bangalore-based technology firm, Infosys INFY, to secure a postal operator and e-commerce logistics provider, Bpost (Belgium Post)’s cloud environment by monitoring and utilizing advanced threat hunting capabilities through Infosys’ Cyber Next solution portfolio.Infosys implemented Palo Alto’s Cortex XSOAR solution, a comprehensive security orchestration, automation and response (“SOAR”) platform, to create robust cyber resilience for mail delivery and e-commerce logistics services of Bpost. Cortex XSOAR’s fully automated response playbooks and artificial intelligence-led predictions will protect Bpost from threats and strengthen its cloud security.Notably, Palo Alto’s acquisition of The Crypsis Group in 2020 strengthened its Cortex platform with expert services for incident response and proactive assurance.In May 2022, the company entered an agreement with Oracle Corporation's ORCL Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Network Firewall to integrate its VM-Series Next-Generation Firewall solution with Oracle Network Firewall for blocking threats and reducing risk breaches.Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure Network Firewall helps customers defend against emerging threats in their cloud adoption journey. With the unified network solution, customers can quickly turn on and secure their applications and cloud environment with Palo Alto’s firewall features and scale their security across their cloud deployment.In April, Palo Alto’s Internet of Things Security solution obtained ""Moderate Authorization"" status for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. This recognition highlights the trust that the U.S. government puts in PANW's standardized threat prevention and Zero Trust enforcement capabilities.Story continuesHowever, Palo Alto faces stiff competition from several big and small players in the security application market. Over the past couple of years, demand for IT security has been on a rise, driven by increased awareness about cyber attacks, making the market more attractive for new players. Established players like Cisco Systems CSCO are sparing no effort to position well in this intensely competitive space.In February, Cisco reportedly made a takeover offer worth more than $20 billion for software maker Splunk Inc. The potential deal is likely to combine Cisco’s strength in network security with Splunk’s strength in data-focused security operations, positioning it well in the security operations space. This deal could mark the networking giant’s biggest acquisition move, making it a daunting competitor for Palo Alto.In the last reported quarter, Palo Alto reported revenues of $1.60 billion. The top line, which grew 27% from the year-earlier reported figure, was aided by several deal wins and increased adoption of Palo Alto’s Next-Generation Security platforms due to the hybrid work culture and the need for stronger security.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CSCO): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cisco-systems-130001099.html,1664974801,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned -6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has lost 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.79 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.31 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.07 billion and $56.1 billion estimates indicate +4.9% and +3.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.2%. EPS of $0.83 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +1.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
