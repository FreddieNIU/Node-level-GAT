If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on social security gaps, investment strategies, and tax-friendly states, you may go to 5 States That Do Not Tax Social Security or Retirement Income. \xa0', 'According to the BlackRock Read on Retirement™ survey by BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), only 56% of workplace savers in 2023 believe they are on track with their retirement savings, down from 68% in 2021. Market volatility, high levels of inflation, recessionary fears, and a lack of retirement income are eroding confidence regarding the retirement years. As a result, 29% of workers now plan to retire later than originally planned.', ""Stock and bond price plummets in 2022 haven't helped improve this confidence, with many retirees witnessing significant erosion in the value of their portfolios. Even though market conditions have been improving, potential savers still have to make up for the losses incurred. In addition to hoping to make up for loss, 93% of workplace savers in the BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) survey are also looking forward to the idea of “a well-diversified fund where you can opt-in to have a portion automatically converted to guaranteed income as you near retirement”. The question is, is that possible?"", 'According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), the right investment strategy can help diversify risk and ensure a stable income is built into your retirement plans. Also known as fixed-income investments, products like bonds allow individuals to hedge against market volatility. CNBC states that bonds are “all the rage” these days, and since interest rates have been witnessing a dramatic shift, investors are being advised to embrace the trend. Since 2022, interest rates have been increasing with the yield-to-maturity on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now nearing 5%, the highest since the Great Financial Crisis in 2007.', 'This shift presents an exciting opportunity for bond investors as real yields, adjusted for inflation, are approaching a level of 2.5%, signaling a positive trend in bond market returns. In short, CNBC recommends adopting a balanced approach for investors to optimize yield potential. This can be done by increasing exposure to long-term bonds and incorporating short-term bonds as well. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) seems to agree, signaling that shorter bonds might be a safer bet for investors.', 'As such, retirees depend on fixed-income investments such as bonds because their sources of income are limited. As of 2023, 67 million Americans have been receiving a social security benefit monthly, amounting to a total of $1.4 trillion. A significant portion of these people are fully dependent on this income to make it through the month. Despite the average 2023 Social Security benefit standing at $1,781.63, retirees, on average, are estimated to spend $4,345 per month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.', ""This gap between the benefits received and actual spend required implies that many seniors are living in a hand-to-mouth situation. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 23% of Americans aged 65 or above are said to be living below the poverty line. Since the future of social security funds is already shaky, it's not the most economical move to tweak it right now. However, what seniors can do to make the most of their Social Security benefits is to opt for states that don't tax their Social Security benefits or retirement income."", 'According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), your tax liability is heavily dependent on where you live. As such, there are a couple of states in the US where there is no income tax. Retirees can live in these states and not pay taxes on social security. A few of them even boast a cost of living that is below the national average, making them the best states to retire in financially. ', '""Whether you\'re a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn\'t that unusual these days. However, the tax implications can be profound, so it\'s smart to take a hard look before you break out the packing tape.""', '- Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'On that note, let’s look at all the states that do not tax social security or retirement income.', 'mffoto/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of states that do not tax social security or retirement income, we began by listing out all the states. Next, we filtered out states with no state income tax. We also highlighted states that do not tax social security or retirement income. 13 states do not tax these incomes. We also picked out two states that have only a small tax levied on social security or retirement income. Next, we scored them on their tax-friendliness, cost-of-living index, and climate.', 'The cost of living index has been sourced from MERIC. A cost of living index of 98 means the cost of living is 2% lower than the national average. To assess tax-friendliness, we utilized Smart Asset rankings. Those deemed ""very tax-friendly"" received a score of 5, ""tax-friendly"" states earned 4 marks, ""moderately tax-friendly"" received 3, and ""tax-unfriendly"" garnered 2. In addition, each state underwent a subjective climate assessment, rated on a scale of 1 to 5.', 'For places with the same scores, tie-breaking has been done based on the cost of living index, with the state with a lower index ranking higher on our list.', 'Here are the States That Do Not Tax Social Security or Retirement Income:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 9', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 126.4', 'Besides grizzly bears and chilly winters, Alaska is also known for not taxing social security or retirement income.

Moreover, there is no sales tax, and no estate or inheritance tax either but the cost of living is 26.4% higher than the national average.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 10', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 115.7', 'Washington is another one of the states that don’t tax social security or retirement income.

It is one of the states that don’t tax retirement income or social security. The state doesn’t have any sales tax, estate tax, or inheritance tax either. However, the state has a 5% tax on dividends and interests that is due to be phased out in January 2027. On the other hand, property taxes are some of the highest in the country. Smart Asset reports that a typical homeowner spends more than $6,097 in property taxes annually. The cost of living is also 15.6% higher than the national average.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 12', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 101.1', 'Nevada is one of the many states that are tax-friendly for Social Security. Since there is no income tax in Nevada, seniors receive all of their social security and retirement income tax-free at the state level. The state also boasts relatively low property taxes.

The cost of living is 1% higher than the national average."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 15', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 93.2', ""One of the best states to retire in financially is Wyoming. Retirees can stretch their retirement savings further in this state considering that it is very tax-friendly and enjoys a low cost of living as well. The state doesn’t tax social security or retirement income as it doesn't have an income tax at all. The cost of living in the state is 6.8% lower than the national average."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 15', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 93', ""Another state that doesn’t tax social security or retirement income is Texas. Texas isn't just tax-friendly but is also revered for its affordable cost of living. The state doesn't have an income tax, which is why all sorts of retirement income as well as social security go un-taxed in the state."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 16', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 91.8', ""Illinois does not tax social security benefits, and it is also one of the states that doesn't tax 401k retirement income. All other forms of retirement income, including pensions, are not taxed in this state. The cost of living is also 8.2% lower than the national average. One drawback of living in this state is that it has some of the highest property and sales taxes in the country."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 16', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 88.2', ""Alabama is one of the states that do not tax Social Security retirement benefits.

Analysts at tech research and consulting firm Gartner foresee cloud computing as an operational necessity in five years or less."", 'The use of cloud computing services caught fire amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses then migrated heavily to online services. So a reliance on cloud computing was emphasized to keep operations moving forward through social distancing measures.', ""Macroeconomic headwinds -- namely high interest rates and staff reductions in a post-pandemic environment -- saw the cloud computing sector tech a hit, especially in 2022. However, big tech's 2023 comeback reemphasized the long-term growth prospects of cloud computing. And that should only increase in the years to come."", '""While many enterprises still see the cloud as a useful way of providing additional capacity over the next few years, they’ll come to see it as a source of innovation. And by 2028 most will see it as a necessity, according to Gartner analysts,"" Tech Republic reported.', ""Furthermore, cloud computing technology itself will be undergoing enhancements to meet the increased demand in today's digital world. This should only push more companies to become reliant on cloud services to run their operations."", '""Part of that will be the result of the conversion or rewriting of legacy applications — perhaps running on mainframes or legacy mid-range systems — to make them ready for the cloud age,"" Tech Republic added. ""At its recent IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies conference in London, analyst firm Gartner said that by 2028, these modernization efforts will result in 70% of tech workloads running in a cloud environment, up from just 25% today.""', ""Traders who want to get exposure to cloud computing can opt for single-stock holdings that specialize in the subsector. However, there's an easier way to get overall exposure and maximize profit potential without having to resort to a margin account. That's via leveraged exchange raded funds (ETFs)."", 'Traders who think the cloud computing trend will continue to provide gains into 2024 and beyond can look at the Direxion Daily Cloud Computing Bull 2X Shares ETF (CLDL), which seeks 200% of the daily performance of the Indxx USA Cloud Computing Index.

He added that “you would rather fund risky trading and derivatives bets than boring, bread-and-butter small business lending.”', 'While Barr proposed the new outline this summer, not every member of the central bank has been onboard.', 'Fed Governor Christopher Waller recently called the proposal ""excessive"" in a conversation with the American Enterprise Institute. He told the think tank last week that if the proposal did away with separate requirements for so-called operational risk — risk from potential losses from disruptions due to internal mismanagement like fraud, or external shocks like a cyberattack — that he could support the proposal. The capital requirement for operational risk is a major sticking point with the banks.', 'There is also a broader sense that changes could be in the offing.

Global defense spending is reaching record levels every single year and according to PwC, elevated geopolitical risks should see a significant increase in defense spending in 2023, as defense budgets increased by double-digits in many countries.

Earlier in July we had significantly trimmed our position to reflect some cyclical risks, so we were relatively less exposed when shares sold off following the announcement. When RTX delayed a scheduled update in early September, we interpreted it as a modestly negative development and further pared our position. When the update came, the stock sold off significantly on news the debacle would amount to around $3 billion over three years — the high end of investor expectations.', 'As we sit here today, we think the market’s reaction to RTX is likely overdone. $3 billion is a large sum, but the company’s market cap has declined over $30 billion since first releasing the news in late July. While this is a black eye for the company and will create headwinds for some time, we think it likely that the current level will mark a durable low and see opportunities to add back a small amount of the RTX we sold at higher prices earlier in the summer.”', 'The U.S. is currently aiming to combine funds for Ukraine and Israel, its closest ally in a bid to thwart Russia and Hamas, while indirectly also impacting Iran.

In September 2021, Ethicon entered into an agreement to resolve more than 3,700 cases across the two groups. As of J&J’s latest update in its quarterly results, most of the cases covered by the agreement had been dismissed.', 'In May, Ethicon entered into an additional settlement with 292 claimants and began receiving releases. As of the start of October, around 720 plaintiffs had pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly linked to Physiomesh, according to J&J’s quarterly filing, down from 2,100 at the start of the year.\xa0', 'Five cases excluded from either settlement remained subject to docket control orders, according to the quarterly filing. At the start of the year, the company had 208 cases subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. The progress means J&J has now dealt with the vast majority of the cases brought against it in relation to Physiomesh.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

Rosner sees openings for investors in the automotive equipment markets, noting that even in an economic downturn, our cars will still need add-ons in safety tech and basics like tires.', 'Describing the industry’s condition, Rosner writes, “After lots of ups and downs for the sector in 2023, including some positive momentum on volume recovery, high hopes for EV adoption, resilient vehicle pricing, but also UAW labor negotiation and strikes, and EV/AV slowdown, we do not expect the 2024 environment to become materially easier.”', 'He goes on to add some specifics for investors to consider, saying, “We view the lack of LVP growth and often adverse vehicle mix, cuts to EV expectations, and large labor cost inflation as top of mind heading into 2024. As such, among OEMs and suppliers, we favor names that are powertrain agnostic, and with strong self-help, broader diversification in customer mix, geographical and end market exposure.”', 'We’re taking Rosner’s advice, and following his recommendations on two particular auto stocks, which he classes as ‘top picks’ for Deutsche Bank.', 'In fact, Rosner is not the only one singing these stocks’ praises. According to the\xa0TipRanks platform\xa0– they are rated as Strong Buys by the Street’s analysts. Let’s take a closer look.', 'Here Are 3 Favorite Stock Ideas From Deutsche Bank — Including One With 60% Upside Potential', 'Bank of America Says the S&P 500 Will Hit a New Record High in 2024 — Here Are 2 Stocks to Play That Bullish Sentiment', 'These 3 stocks are Cowen’s best ideas for 2024 including AstraZeneca and Datadog', 'Mobileye Global (MBLY)', 'First up is Mobileye, a tech company that has built itself into the gold standard for automotive sensor and driver assistance technologies. Mobileye’s sensors can be either factory installed or retro-fitted to existing vehicles; either way, the system helps drivers maintain a safe distance from potential road hazards, everything from other cars to lane markers, road shoulders, and crash barriers. The company has working arrangements with over 50 of the industry’s original equipment manufacturers, and Mobileye sensors are installed on more than 125 million vehicles globally.', 'The basic idea behind Mobileye’s system was simple: high-end digital cameras could become the ‘eyes’ of the car, and the central feature of a life-saving driver-assistance technology. That idea has borne fruit, leading to a line of Mobileye products scalable for vehicles of all sizes and purposes. The company has really come into its own in the autonomous vehicle niche, where the Mobileye sensor systems are used to provide a superior level of 360-degree, all-condition vision for self-driving cars.', 'For customers, the system offers options to fit the skill levels and preferences of all drivers. Customers can choose front and rear cameras, 360-degree vision coverage, and LiDAR sensors for improved vision at night and in adverse weather conditions.', 'Demand for improved safety technology is up in the automotive industry, and Mobileye has been driving that toward improved revenue and earnings over the past several quarters. In the company’s last quarterly financial release for 3Q23, the top-line revenue came to $530 million; this beat the forecast by $2.12 million and also grew by nearly 18% year-over-year. At the bottom line, Mobileye brought in a non-GAAP earnings per share of 22 cents, scoring 5 cents ahead of the pre-release estimates. For 2023, through the end of Q3, Mobileye reported a sound balance sheet, generating $285 million in net cash from operations and finishing the third quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and liquid assets – and no debt.', 'All in all, Rosner points out that Mobileye’s solutions are a perfect fit for the likely evolution of the auto industry, and he writes, “We believe MBLY is one of the ‘last man’ standing in vehicle autonomy, with solutions essentially powertrain-agnostic and equal CPV in an EV or ICE alike. Indeed, as Cruise’s fallout demonstrates the reality of challenging commercialization of true robotaxis, we believe MBLY’s modular and scalable approach to higher ADAS in a cost effective manner may become increasingly appetizing to global OEMs. The company has indicated that it is speaking to 10 OEMs that represent 34% of global production, and has high confidence that several of these programs will be converted to firm orders in the next 5-6 months.”', '“As customer design wins are expected to come in the next few months, we believe the company has large potential positive catalysts on the near horizon to demonstrate its considerable potential for long-term growth,” Rosner added.', 'Looking ahead, the Deutsche Bank analyst sees this stock fit for a Buy rating, with a $50 price target to imply a 25% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating here is based on 14 analyst reviews, with a lopsided ratio of 13 Buy recommendations to 1 Hold recommendation. The shares are currently trading at $39.89, and the average price target of $50.50 suggests a potential gain of 27% in the coming year. (See Mobileye stock forecast)', 'Goodyear Tire (GT)', 'The second stock we’ll look at here, Goodyear Tire, is one of the world’s iconic brands, known for its quality products – and for its eponymous Goodyear Blimp that has long been a staple at sporting events and parades. Goodyear got its start ‘way back in 1898, and over the past 125 years, the firm’s operations have grown to encompass 57 facilities in 23 countries, employing some 74,000 people. Goodyear has long been the largest tire company in the US market and is consistently ranked among the top five tire companies globally.', 'Goodyear’s business benefits from two underlying facts of all modern vehicles: that they won’t go anywhere without good tires, and that those tires will wear out and need replacing. This makes Goodyear’s chief product an essential item in much of the world, with a large and expanding market. In dollar terms, the automotive tire market was valued at $126 billion in 2022, and that number is expected to reach $176 billion by 2027. That’s a large market, and growth of $10 billion annually gives plenty of room to grow with the market.', 'In addition to the natural growth of the tire industry, Goodyear is finding support from an unexpected direction – the push to expand the role of EVs on our roads. Due to their large battery packs, EVs are typically heavier than combustion-engine vehicles in the same class, which means they wear out their tires faster and require a more rapid replacement cycle – and that in turn means increased business for tire companies like Goodyear.', 'When we look at Goodyear’s last few years’ worth of revenue data, we find that the company’s top line has been remarkably stable – at or near $5 billion per quarter – and that makes sense in light of the steady demand for car tires. Earnings have been more volatile, responding to shifts in product pricing and availability and costs of raw materials. A look at the last quarter reported, 3Q23, shows that Goodyear brought in $5.14 billion at the top line; this was 3% below the year-ago figure and almost $140 million under the forecast. The bottom line came to 36 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, beating the estimates by 17 cents per share.', 'Shares in GT are up 39% so far this year, and have been trending upward since early November. The stock got a boost in part from Deutsche Bank’s assessment, that the rally will likely continue, and analyst Rosner explains the bank’s position, saying, “With a credible operational turnaround path, strategic portfolio optimization through large noncore divestitures, and new leadership coming in to execute, we see strong potential for the company to improve its profitability and narrow the gap with its peers through self-help, de-leverage its balance sheet, and unlock large shareholder value.”', 'In fact, Rosner believes that Goodyear is uniquely positioned to deliver strong growth, and he doesn’t hold back form describing that potential: “Indeed, after years of chronic underperformance, we believe Goodyear has the potential to become one of more compelling investments in US autos over the next year, reflecting its idiosyncratic opportunity to fix profitability and cut leverage through well-identified self-help actions, under new leadership. Goodyear also is a powertrain-agnostic turnaround story, without the uncertainty of an EV slow-down.”', 'The analyst goes on to rate GT shares as a Buy, and he sets a $21 price target that points toward a 49% upside for the stock on the one-year horizon. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, this is a stock that has slipped under the radar a bit, it only has 4 recent analyst reviews, but those reviews have a 3 to 1 split favoring Buys against Holds for a Strong Buy consensus. The average target price here, $17.95, implies a 27% one-year increase from the current share price of $14.09.

(""Crown Castle"" or the ""Company""), today sent a letter to Crown Castle\'s Board (the ""Board"") summarizing the feedback received since publicly sharing its views on the Company last week. The feedback, which was overwhelmingly supportive of change at Crown Castle, came from investors, analysts, current and former employees, and industry experts, among others.', 'As Elliott wrote in the letter, ""the commentary has been consistent and highly critical of the Company and its strategy and leadership, including the apparent lack of oversight by the Board.""', 'Elliott went on to note that in the week following the release of its materials, Crown Castle\'s stock price appreciated by 14.5% and the Company outperformed its direct peers by 8.4% – the largest week of outperformance for Crown Castle in the last decade.

(together, ""Elliott"" or ""we""). Since publicly sharing our views last week on Crown Castle Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Crown Castle""), we have had the opportunity to hear from numerous investors, analysts and industry leaders on the merits of our perspectives and recommendations. The feedback has been overwhelmingly supportive of significant change at Crown Castle, including unsolicited feedback from many current and former employees and executives of the Company. CEO Jay Brown\'s Fiber strategy has been universally panned by investors, industry insiders (including competitors, peers and advisors) and even the Company\'s own employees to such an extent that the Board\'s failure of oversight deserves intense scrutiny. In today\'s letter, we summarize this feedback and question what level of underperformance this Board will tolerate before taking action.', ""To begin, we think it is important to highlight the extraordinary support for the mere prospect of CEO and strategy change manifested in Crown Castle's stock price. In the week following the release of our materials, Crown Castle's stock appreciated by 14.5%1. More importantly, Crown Castle outperformed its direct peers – American Tower and SBA Communications – by 8.4%2, which stands as the largest week of outperformance for Crown Castle in the last decade."", 'See ""Crown Castle\'s Top 10 Weeks of Outperformance Over Last Decade2"" image.', ""The magnitude of Crown Castle's outperformance was so great, it exceeded that of any one-week relative move over the entirety of Jay Brown's tenure as CEO, underscoring that the degree of sentiment shift was truly unique. In effect, Jay Brown's severe underperformance as a CEO has made the prospect of his departure his greatest moment of outperformance. Unquestionably, the investment community has signaled with its capital that change is both necessary and urgent at Crown Castle."", ""In terms of the direct feedback that we have received, the commentary has been consistent and highly critical of the Company and its strategy and leadership, including the apparent lack of oversight by the Board. We encourage you as directors to have the same conversations, in a format that allows for candor, and not rely on management's portrayal of sentiment. Such discussions are critical to understanding the situation today across constituents: shareholders, equity research analysts, current and former employees and industry insiders. Since the release of our materials, we have been inundated with feedback, which can be summarized as follows:"", 'Industry insiders and advisors broadly acknowledge that Crown Castle paid richly for its Fiber assets and had minimal understanding of how to operate a Fiber business. (E.g., one highly regarded industry leader told us bluntly, ""Jay overpaid for their Fiber assets and then didn\'t know how to run them. Everyone in the industry knows this."")', 'Current and former employees and executives do not have faith in the leadership of the CEO and the small number of executives on his team who remain committed to the Fiber strategy. (E.g., see the ""CEO Approval"" metric on Glassdoor, which, at 51%, lags the CEO approval ratings of Crown Castle\'s peers by a staggering amount.)3', 'The CEO and Board have adopted a head-in-the-sand approach to the Company\'s deep and persistent underperformance. (E.g., one former Crown Castle senior executive told us, ""I\'ve watched the Executive Management Team and Board try to conceal and ignore massive problems for so long that it\'s been both shocking and disappointing."")', 'Most important, based on our conversations with our fellow Crown Castle shareholders, the CEO has thoroughly lost the confidence of the Company\'s shareholder base. Across many discussions with a diverse range of holders, we have not yet identified a single shareholder who believes Crown Castle\'s status-quo strategy is working. (In fact, many have commented that they have conveyed similar criticisms of the Fiber strategy to Crown Castle\'s leadership team for years and that their concerns have largely been ignored.) Not a single shareholder has suggested to us that Crown Castle should continue investing more than $1 billion per year in low-yielding Fiber capex. And not a single shareholder with whom we spoke has praised Jay Brown as a successful CEO or defended his track record. (E.g., as one large Crown Castle shareholder told us in a representative comment, ""If Jay is gone, the stock goes up. The math tells you they are a destroyer of value."")', 'In addition to these conversations, we have had the opportunity to speak with most of the 24 equity research analysts who cover the Company, and we have yet to identify a single analyst who disagrees with our core thesis. These analysts have followed Crown Castle and its industry closely for years – in some cases more than a decade – and they speak regularly to the largest investors in the Company and its peers. Their perspectives reflect not only their own independent analysis, but also the perspectives they have consistently heard from investors and industry insiders, and they are therefore a good reflection of broader sentiment toward Crown Castle.', ""While opinions differ on the best solution (ranging from a Fiber divestiture to a curtailment of Fiber capex), we believe there is widespread support for a top-to-bottom review of the Fiber strategy. Thus far, 10 equity research analysts have published reports in response to Elliott's renewed call for change, which we believe are uniformly supportive of our perspectives:"", 'BMO: ""We find ourselves largely agreeing with Elliott\'s views. As outlined in our recent initiation, we believe CCI\'s fiber/small cell strategy has been a key driver of its relative underperformance and valuation discount to peers.""', 'Citi: ""Taking a step back, we believe Crown has an opportunity to further improve Fiber segment performance, re-balance capital allocation to improve the annual funding mechanism for its fiber segment, and retain the previously established long-term objective of increasing ownership (not just control) of land underneath its strategic towers.""', 'Deutsche Bank: ""[W]e have increased our price target (and target valuation multiples) to better reflect the recent change in interest rates, alongside the prospect for potential changes in CCI\'s approach to its fiber business in upcoming years.""', 'Green Street: ""To say the fiber/small-cell business has been a thorn in the side for Crown Castle would be an understatement. The investment community has nagged the company for years about its decision not to follow peers into international macro tower investments and rather invest heavily in an unproven technology.""', 'Jefferies: ""[A] quick sale of the fiber business should drive immediate upside to the stock as we believe the market ascribes little value to the fiber business.""', 'MoffettNathanson: ""From where things stand today, it\'s far clearer that the performance of the fiber segment has underwhelmed. The argument that investments into small cells and fiber solutions merit greater scrutiny strikes us as much stronger today than it did three years ago, especially considering the higher cost of capital.""', 'Raymond James: ""CCI\'s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) has significantly lagged that of AMT and SBAC on 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year time horizons, and has been 72% and 98% lower than AMT and SBAC respectively since current CEO Jay Brown was promoted from the CFO role. This suggests the poor performance goes beyond just the impact of rates and into the fundamentals and capital allocation decisions of the company. And it seems that Elliott has a stronger case and a more receptive investor audience this time.""', 'RBC: ""Our impromptu discussions with investors about this matter suggest roughly two thirds of investors favor a divestiture of the fiber/small cell business, at which point they believe it would trade roughly at parity with towerco peers on a trading multiple basis.""', 'TD Cowen: ""Three years have passed, and we\'ve seen both lackluster fiber results from Crown as well as lackluster fiber/small cell results across the industry…A sale of the fiber/small cell business would result in the best/fastest way toward stock appreciation given (1) it would provide Crown a solution out of its \'capital box\', and (2) Crown\'s multiple would climb to reflect the U.S. Towers business.""', 'Wells Fargo: ""Jay Brown is the primary architect behind CCI\'s fiber / small cell strategy, which has underwhelmed since its inception…We agree with Elliott\'s assertion that the CCI strategy is in need of a refresh.""4,5', 'Across all of these many conversations, the most frequent reaction we have heard can be summarized as follows: ""We agree with you. But why should this time be different than 2020, and why do you believe that Elliott can facilitate leadership and strategy change?""', ""This is a very good question and one that we would turn back to the Board. So far, investors have heard little from the Company in response to Elliott's published views. However, several actions since the release of our materials reinforce the perception that the Board's oversight failures are ongoing."", 'For example, one day after the release of our materials (in which we detailed our analysis of the value-destructive Fiber business), Crown Castle announced that the COO of the underperforming Fiber business would be made COO of the Tower business as well, after a ""monthslong external and internal search."" Many observers shared with us that ""tone deaf"" was their immediate reaction to this news, and we agree. Additionally, on November 29th, TMT Finance reported that Crown Castle is soliciting bids for a portfolio of land leases under its towers. We, and many others, believe that this is yet another example of the CEO\'s irresponsible financial management –\xa0i.e., that Crown Castle is essentially mortgaging its best assets to fund yet more value-destructive Fiber capex.', ""Proceeding in this way, in defiance of both sound decision-making and a clearly growing consensus for fundamental change, would be a profound mistake. While we remain hopeful that we can align with the Board on a constructive path forward, it is even clearer to us today based on the feedback we have received that Crown Castle requires CEO change and a robust review of the Fiber business. The Board's refusal to act in the face of such overwhelming data and robust support for change would be a failure of its most basic duty of oversight and stewardship on behalf of shareholders (in addition to the egregious governance lapses highlighted in our prior letters)."", 'The underperformance of CEO Jay Brown and his Fiber strategy is unambiguous: When we launched our 2020 campaign, Crown Castle had\xa0underperformed its direct peers by an average of 70% during the tenure of this leadership team. That underperformance has now expanded to 85%, translating into $26 billion of unfulfilled value.6\xa0Yet this Board has remained unwilling to make the right decision and change course, leaving us and other investors wondering:', 'Having been warned three years ago that the Fiber strategy was the road to value destruction, and having watched that destruction take place and done nothing, how much more value destruction will this Board permit before finally taking action and changing the leadership of Crown Castle?', 'If the current Board is unwilling to take this necessary step, we will nominate a new Board that will. And based on the feedback we have received, we are confident that shareholders will choose a Board with a greater commitment to shareholder stewardship and best-in-class governance.

But they have all but disappeared in the private sector as employers rushed to get them off their balance sheets over the past two decades.', 'IBM, often perceived as a leader in the corporate world, was one of the first large employers to announce a shift to an all-defined contribution retirement program in 2006, and the decision was a harbinger of a plunge in the number of employers offering traditional pensions.', '“IBM was the huge brand name to make that move,” said John Lowell, a partner at October Three, a firm that provides consulting services to plan sponsors. “Other companies thought, ‘Well, if IBM is doing this, there must be a reason.’”', 'But now, IBM delivered a shock of sorts when it said last month that starting on Jan. 1, 2024, it will introduce a Retirement Benefit Account (RBA) for all of its U.S. employees. Employees can continue to contribute to their 401(k) accounts. But the match will be replaced by a contribution of 5% of pay to the RBA, along with a one-time pay increase of 1%. The pay credits will accumulate interest credits at a rate of 6% for the first three years, and will be tied to Treasury rates in the years that follow, with a floor of 3% for the first seven years.', 'The RBA is a defined-benefit structure known as a cash balance plan. Employees do not have individual accounts; instead, the plan “defines” a benefit it will pay from its general assets. The benefit is defined as a lump-sum amount that can be paid in retirement as an annuity calculated to equal the lifetime value of your accumulated sum.', 'IBM is not saying much about its motivations. A company spokesperson said: ""By introducing this retirement benefit within IBM’s Personal Pension Plan, which is stable and well-funded, IBM is able to provide a benefit to employees that also helps diversify their retirement portfolios.”', 'IBM is not the only employer thinking about restarting a defined-benefit plan. Jonathan Price, who leads the national retirement practice at benefits consulting firm Segal, said he has fielded more calls about unfreezing or starting a new pension plan in the past year than he has in the past decade.', ""“In the last few decades, sponsors may have decided that there were certain risks that were just untenable for their balance sheet or for cost purposes,” he said. “But they've learned that with the right design and investment structure, the risks can be managed, much more closely.”"", 'WHERE PENSIONS SHINE', 'It is too early to say if IBM’s decision signals a major move by plan sponsors back to defined-benefit plans. But the benefits of the company’s shift are clear.', 'All of IBM’s employees will participate in the RBA, and receive the same annual contribution. That is different from the typical defined-contribution plan, where participation is voluntary - and not all employees have the financial wherewithal to contribute enough to get the full matching contribution. By contrast, any form of universal defined-benefit plan helps combat rising wealth inequality in retirement.', 'A recent report by the National Institute on Retirement Security and the UC Berkeley Labor Center, for example, found that defined-benefit pensions reduce retiree poverty and near-poverty across race, sex, and educational attainment, with the largest improvement provided to Black and Latino retirees, and retirees without four-year college degrees.', 'The RBA also addresses the problem faced by employees in converting 401(k) balances into steady streams of retirement income. Employers and policymakers have recognized that problem, as evidenced by the U.S. Congress passing the Secure Act of 2019, which cleared the path to add insurance company annuities in defined-contribution plans.', 'But defined-benefit plans offer a much more efficient way to provide a guaranteed income stream. Lowell has found that plans combining defined benefit and defined contribution are anywhere from 10% to 30% less expensive than a commercial annuity option, especially for large companies that may already have a defined-benefit plan that has been frozen or closed.', 'Pensions also can help employers manage workforce challenges, Price notes. Pensions are an attractive benefit that can help attract talent in a competitive labor market - but their guaranteed income streams also make it easier for older workers to retire, clearing the path for younger workers to move up.', ""Said Price: “Some of the conversations we’re hearing about from employers are about recruitment and retention, and some are about making sure that there's the right intergenerational shift so that individuals can feel confident in their ability to retire.”"", 'The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.', '(Writing by Mark Miller Editing by Matthew Lewis)']"

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Exelon ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:', '8.4% = US$2.1b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Exelon has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Electric Utilities industry average (8.3%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Exelon by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", 'Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.', ""Exelon clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.70. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'Of course Exelon may not be the best stock to buy.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine."", 'We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$10.5b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$13.0b', 'US$13.7b', 'US$14.2b', 'US$14.7b', 'US$15.1b', 'US$15.5b', 'US$15.9b', 'US$16.3b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 3.77%', 'Est @ 3.31%', 'Est @ 2.98%', 'Est @ 2.75%', 'Est @ 2.59%', 'Est @ 2.48%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$9.9k', 'US$10.7k', 'US$10.9k', 'US$10.7k', 'US$10.5k', 'US$10.2k', 'US$9.9k', 'US$9.6k', 'US$9.2k', 'US$8.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$101b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Up more than 10% since its last earnings date, the blue-chip stock paces for its best year in more than six decades."", 'I like what is happening with GE as its rivals struggle. While the valuation is high right now, earnings per share growth is expected to be robust while the technical situation suggests upwards of 40% upside from here. Being mindful of important risks is critical, though.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with GE.', 'According to Bank of America Global Research, GE is a global conglomerate with diversified operations in its Aerospace, Power and Renewable Energy segments. Its products and services include power generation, aircraft engines, renewable energy and other data technology niches, though it spun off its health care unit in December 2022 and it is expected that GE Aerospace and Vernova spinoffs will be completed in the coming months. The company does business in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa.', 'With a $133 billion market cap, the Boston-based company within the Industrials sector trades at a high 46.2 forward non-GAAP price-earnings ratio and pays a low 0.3% forward dividend yield. With earnings due out next month, shares feature a low 19% implied volatility percentage, according to Option Research & Technology Services. Short interest on the stock is modest at just 0.7% as of Dec. 1.', 'Back in October, GE reported a strong third quarter. Non-GAAP earnings of 82 cents per share topped estimates by 26 cents while $17.3 billion of revenue, up almost 20% from the same period a year earlier, was an impressive $1.61 billion beat. The company reported total orders of $17.9 billion, a 19% year-over-year gain, with organic orders higher by 18% annually. Organic margins also expanded by 760 basis points year over year.', ""Sending shares higher were not just the third-quarter operating results, but also a healthy 2023 guide and balance sheet improvements. Adjusted earnings per share is now seen in the $2.55 to $2.65 range compared to the consensus of $2.34 at the time and prior guidance of $2.10 to $2.30. General Electric expects free cash flow of nearly $5 billion this year. Future spinoffs at GE Aerospace and GE Vernova (Renewable Energy & Power) should help the management team focus on its core segments. Also beneficial for shareholders is the company's focus on reducing its balance sheet by paying off debt. Key risks include any hiccups in the cyclical aerospace segment and any disruptions in the power segment due to higher interest rates today."", 'Another unknown is how the spinoffs proceed given some executive changes. I do not expect this to be a major negative headline risk, but several leadership changes were announced last month. Of course, once the spinoffs are completed, GE shares themselves will be generally immune to operational and execution challenges, should they occur, at the new companies.', ""On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see non-GAAP earnings being about flat for 2023. Sales growth is forecasted to drop about 15% this year before top-line growth resumes in 2024 with further gains in 2025. Consensus out-year earnings per share is near $4.60 and per-share profits could top $6 by 2025 based on strong upward earnings revisions in the last handful of weeks. Dividends, meanwhile, are expected to hold steady at just 32 cents per share, making for a below-market yield, but rising free cash flow may allow for shareholder-accretive activities in the years ahead. Still, with robust growth GE's earnings multiple should retreat over the coming quarters if the stock price holds steady."", 'If we apply a 23 times multiple, half its five-year average forward operating price-earnings ratio, on $6 of expected 2025 earnings per share, then shares should be near $138. I assert that a low-20s multiple is right given a more than doubling of earnings per share from 2023 to 2025. Also, that would be about a 13 times enterprise value/Ebitda valuation using 2025 numbers, on par with its peers.', 'Source: BofA Global Research', ""Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show a confirmed fourth-quarter 2023 earnings date of Tuesday, Jan. 23 with a conference call immediately after the numbers cross the wires. Later in the quarter, the company's management team is expected to present spinoff figures and offer color on operations in its GE Vernova Investor Day on March 6 and GE Aerospace Investor Day on March 7 so keep those dates on your calendar for potential volatility."", 'Source: Wall Street Horizon', 'Shares of General Electric have endured a volatile past. The stock peaked at $484 in 2000 during its turn-of-the-century heyday. Shares cratered during the dot-com bubble, but then came back to life during the 2002 to 2007 bull market, hitting a rebound high of $337 in 2007 immediately before the Great Financial Crisis. Troubles in its GE Capital unit led to a more than 80% plunge to under $50 and a lower high was notched in 2016 at $264. The stock briefly undercut its financial crisis low in March 2020, but are now at fresh highs dating back to 2018.', 'Notice in the chart below that a healthy uptrend is in place. The long-term 200-day moving average is trending up in a linear fashion, currently at $105. Following a consolidation from this past July through October, GE is once again moving up. With bullish momentum in clear view, one chart pattern points to further upside ahead. A measured move price objective to the $170 to $175 range is in play following a breakout through $117 resistance a cup and handle pattern with a height of $56 suggests about 40% of potential gains ahead. Of course, that is just one indicator, but with the RSI momentum oscillator printing fresh multi-month highs, the strong price action is confirmed by momentum.

This injection of capital is underway amidst a challenging labor market, fluctuating energy prices, and persistent endeavors to curtail carbon emissions in both the energy and industrial domains. The U.S. manufacturing industry, constituting a substantial segment of the overall U.S. materials sector, leveraged the momentum generated by the aforementioned pieces of legislation. This resulted in a nearly twofold increase in investments for semiconductor and clean technology manufacturing compared to the commitments made in 2021, and an allocation nearly 20 times greater than the amount designated in 2019.

The smart factory incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as AI, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, and cloud computing into the production environment, offering real-time insights, end-to-end visibility, and scalable solutions. The potential advantages of smart factories are extensive, encompassing improvements in asset efficiency, labor productivity, and product quality, leading to substantial cost reductions.

The current year has showcased significant strength, and it looks like the trend might continue into the next year. Even though things seem positive now, investor sentiment can change suddenly because of things like global tensions, economic news, or unexpected events. Ned Davis Research pointed out that in 2024, the focus will be on the Federal Reserve and its Chair, Jerome Powell. Powell's goal is to guide the economy smoothly, aiming for a soft landing. According to NDR, they estimate a 70% likelihood of Powell achieving this objective. Here is what the investment management services said in its 2024 outlook note:"", '""Lower inflation should allow the Fed to cut rates and the 10-year Treasury to fall toward 3.5%. A soft landing should permit the cyclical bull market to continue. Our year-end S&P 500 target is 4900, about 7% above current levels.""', 'Regardless of how optimistic or pessimistic the market appears, investors consistently lean towards safe stocks that provide stability, especially during tough market situations. Among these safe investment options, dividend stocks stand out as a preferred choice. These stocks belong to companies with a proven track record of consistent dividend payments, often from established sectors like utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare. In addition to this, historical analysis consistently highlights the outperformance of dividend stocks compared to various other asset classes across different market cycles. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, growing dividends have the potential to enhance investment gains and counteract the effects of inflation by offering a continuously growing source of income. The report further mentioned that between the late 1980s and the end of 2022, companies within the Russell 1000 Index that consistently increased their dividends performed better than the overall index. Not only did they deliver higher returns, but they also showed less fluctuation or instability in their performance.', ""Despite experiencing lower performance in 2023 compared to some other investments, analysts maintain a positive outlook on dividend stocks, particularly those companies that consistently raise their dividend payouts. When a company consistently pays dividends over the long haul, it typically indicates that the company is making strides in the right direction and prioritizing the creation of value for its shareholders. According to Wolfe Research, stocks from these companies have typically shown better performance both before and after economic downturns like recessions. Chris Senyek, Wolfe Research's chief investment strategist, mentioned to Barron’s that he favors dividend aristocrats as his top dividend strategy. This group offers the highest yield among dividend strategies, currently at 2.6%. They're also cheaper than the overall market and have a history of performing strongly after interest rate hikes."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has lost 9.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.
