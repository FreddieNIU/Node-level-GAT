New cars made today can have as many as 3,000 chips per vehicle, meaning a long battle between major automakers and the UAW union could eventually start to weigh on production and chip suppliers.Texas Instruments (TXN) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are among the largest auto chip manufacturers in the world, while TSMC (TSM) is the leading contract chip manufacturer. Shares of all three chipmakers moved lower on Friday.And more chipmakers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Micron (MU) could see effects over time too, as both have substantial connected car businesses. Qualcomm has doubled down on its auto business in recent years, while Micron is often discussed as the market leader when it comes to auto memory chips.The impact on these companies varies based on a few factors, including the length of the strike and each company's exposure to automakers. The UAW has opted for a ""stand up"" strike, in which workers walk out at select GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants rather than all at once, in order to prolong the action and the union's $825 million strike fund.In 2022, 52% of NXP's total revenue came from its automotive chips, according to Counterpoint Research, while Texas Instruments derived 25% of its total revenue from the industry, company reports showed.

Apple (AAPL) opens up pre-orders for the new iPhone 15, with delivery dates of certain models being pushed back. Steelmaker Nucor (NUE) sees its stock move lower on weakened guidance tied to business slowdowns.Yahoo Finance Live’s Julie Hyman and Diane King Hall discuss which stocks are making moves this morning, while also breaking down the drop in consumer sentiment data reported by the University of Michigan.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: We're about 30 minutes into the trading day. Let's take a look at how stocks are moving. Stocks are under some pressure this morning. You're looking at the S&amp;P 500 down about 4/10 of a percent, but Wall Street is heading towards a winning week. The move higher in oil prices continues to be a focus. Crude trading at 10-month highs and boosted this morning by a stronger data out of the world's second largest economy.JULIE HYMAN: And looking at individual names, we were watching Shake Shack on the move today up 2 and 1/4%. The stock is getting a bump on an analyst call from Northcoast Research, which is raising it to buy from neutral and citing improved traffic trends. The analysts there expect strong commuter traffic in the summer will continue this fall as employees get back to the office.DIANE KING HALL: Shares of Apple trading under a little bit of pressure down 4/10 of a percent. Pre-orders for the iPhone 15 opening earlier this morning, and delivery dates for the Pro Max already getting pushed back to October. Bloomberg is reporting China is seeing shipment delays of 4 to 5 weeks for the Pro Max.JULIE HYMAN: And shares of steelmaker, Nucor, trading lower by about 2.6% after issuing weak guidance for the third quarter. The company sees diluted earnings per share in the range of 410 to 420 that is well below estimates. And in the second quarter, the company reported $5.81 a share. The decline attributed to slowdown in multiple areas of that business.Story continuesWell, we just had University of Michigan's consumer confidence. The preliminary reading here for September-- so very current data-- and it came in a little bit lower than economists were projecting and a slowdown from August at 67.7 versus 69.5 in August and versus the 69 that analysts had been projecting. Some interesting things within the data. This is broken out into current conditions, which deteriorated quite a bit to 69.8. Expectations, which improved to 66.3.And to me, the most interesting part of this inflation expectations are moderating. Even though we have discussed some concerns in the market here that the rising energy prices will start to put pressure not only on headline but trickle down into core inflation, one-year inflation expectations falling to 3.1% from 3 and 1/2%, Diane.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. So it is interesting to note that, and also just the divergence in expectations and current conditions, that's always something that often stands out to me. Another thing that was interesting to me that consumers don't really care at this point about potential government shutdown, pointing out in the survey that they didn't mention it, you know.JULIE HYMAN: Few people worried about it, but they said that could change.DIANE KING HALL: Yes, it could change. And that often changes as we get closer to that-- you know, the potential of that happening. And it's all like we always get right there and then--JULIE HYMAN: Right up to the 11th hour.DIANE KING HALL: Exactly. Exactly.JULIE HYMAN: So we'll continue to watch those sentiment numbers, also as we get the revisions to this preliminary.DIANE KING HALL: Exactly.]"

For the quarter, Nucor anticipates earnings to be within the range of $4.10 to $4.20 per share. This projection marks a decrease from the second quarter of 2023, when it reported earnings of $5.81 per share and a decline from the third quarter of 2022, when earnings were $6.50 per share.The expected decline in earnings for the third quarter of 2023 is primarily attributed to lower earnings in the steel mills segment, which is anticipated to be impacted by lower pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced volumes. The sheet mills within the segment are expected to experience the most significant impact on earnings.Similarly, the steel products segment is also expected to see a decline in earnings for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023. This decline is due to lower realized prices and reduced volumes.The raw materials segment is also projected to have lower earnings in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023. This is mainly attributed to margin compression at Nucor's DRI facilities and scrap processing operations.During the third quarter, Nucor has been actively engaged in share repurchases, having repurchased approximately 3 million shares at an average price of $168.99 per share. The company has repurchased approximately 8.8 million shares at an average price of $157.36 per share. Nucor has returned more than $1.76 billion to its stockholders through share repurchases and dividend payments this year.Nucor has gained 41.4% in the past year, compared with the industry's 47.1% rise in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor’s second-quarter 2023 earnings of $5.81 per share declined from the previous year’s levels but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59.

16,32fae1a7-9370-396a-b2ca-86a67669f88b,NUE,2023-09-16,Nucor Corporation (NUE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-attracting-investor-130007255.html,1694782807,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this steel company have returned -1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 3.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.55 points to a change of -35.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.10 indicates a change of -34.8% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -16.8%. The $34.82 billion and $31.83 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -16.1% and -8.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $9.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. EPS of $5.81 for the same period compares with $9.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was +3.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.92, up 27.15% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.1 billion, up 4.36% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.73 per share and revenue of $12.36 billion.

This makes the dividend yield 5.5%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.U.S. Bancorp has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Based on U.S. Bancorp's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 53%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 28.3%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 43% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendU.S. Bancorp Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.78 total annually to $1.92. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.4% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.U.S. Bancorp May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Unfortunately, U.S. Bancorp's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year.Our Thoughts On U.S. Bancorp's DividendIn summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $524.56 in the previous session. Cintas has gained 15.9% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 14.9% return for the Zacks Uniform and Related industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 13, 2023, Cintas reported EPS of $3.33 versus consensus estimate of $3.19 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.65%.For the current fiscal year, Cintas is expected to post earnings of $14.29 per share on $9.45 billion in revenues. This represents a 10.01% change in EPS on a 9.77% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $15.83 per share on $10.09 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.76% and 6.83%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCintas may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Cintas has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 36.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 29.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 30.3X versus its peer group's average of 22X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.05. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cintas passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Cintas shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels and Llama 2, is likely to aid prospects.However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes.

The company's performance is driven by its robust omnichannel operations aimed at improving the overall shopping experience. Walmart strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has been especially rewarding.This is evident from the constant increase in the market share for groceries, which boosted U.S. comparable sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

IPW reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year. However, the company reported a wider-than-expected loss.iPower Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise iPower Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | iPower Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailsiPower posted a loss of 10 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share and the loss of 5 cents per share reported in the year-ago period.Net sales were $23.4 million, up 6% year over year. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22 million. This increase was attributed to greater product sales to the company’s largest channel partner and strong demand for iPower’s non-hydroponic product portfolio.Gross profit of $9.1 million was flat with the year-ago quarter. Also, the gross margin contracted 250 basis points to 38.7% from the prior-year period. The decline in the gross margin mainly resulted from the increased cost of goods sold tied to inventory that had previously experienced elevated freight charges, along with normal variations in the product and channel mix.Operating expenses increased 13.2% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Also, the operating margin increased 330 basis points from the prior-year period to 51.3%. The rise in operating margin was partly due to increased expenses associated with selling, fulfillment and marketing, which were incurred in conjunction with the sale of inventory built up in the prior quarters. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Other Financial DetailsiPower ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 million. As of Jun 30, 2023, net debt was down 43% to $8.1 million from $14.2 million as of Jun 30, 2022. Total stockholders' equity was $20.9 million at the end of the quarter under review.OutlookFiscal 2023 was the third straight year when iPower registered double-digit revenue growth, owing to stellar and consistent demand for its in-house products, which constituted more than 90% of the total revenues. Additionally, iPower continued to diversify its product offerings beyond hydroponics, with non-hydroponic products making up more than 75% of sales in fiscal 2023.Throughout the past year, management focused on addressing the challenge of high-cost inventory build-up from previous periods, which had been hurting the gross margin lately. Encouragingly, the company has successfully reduced excess inventory levels and foresees a gross margin improvement in fiscal 2024. With a more streamlined and efficient supply chain, normalized inventory levels, and sustained demand for products, the company remains confident in attaining growth and profitability goals.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have railed 16.5% in the past six months against the industry's decline of 7.9%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderBelow, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.

Retail sales for the month exceeded expectations, primarily driven by a sharp increase in gasoline prices, a consequence of production cuts enacted by Saudi Arabia and the OPEC+ alliance. This rise in gasoline prices translated into higher spending at gasoline stations. However, this surge impacted consumers' budgets, particularly as families prepared for the back-to-school season.While there was a notable spike in retail spending on fuel, growth in expenditures on other items remained relatively modest. This suggests that Americans exercised prudence in their spending, possibly in response to the prevailing challenges of rising inflation and increased borrowing costs. Last month, the consumer price index rose 0.6% sequentially and 3.7% from the year-ago period, per the U.S. Department of Labor.A Peek Into Retail Sales NumbersAugust marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. The Commerce Department reported a sequential increase of 0.6% in U.S. retail and food services sales for August, reaching a total of $697.6 billion. This followed a revised reading of a 0.5% increase registered in July. Impressively, August retail sales rose 2.5% from the year-ago period.The Commerce Department's latest report reveals a diverse range of trends in retail sales. Motor vehicle &amp; parts dealers saw a modest increase of 0.3% in sales on a sequential basis. Building material &amp; supplies dealers experienced a slight uptick of 0.1%, while electronics &amp; appliance stores reported a more substantial jump of 0.7%.Food &amp; beverage stores posted growth of 0.4%, whereas clothing &amp; clothing accessories outlets saw a robust increase of 0.9%. General merchandise stores showed a modest 0.3% uptick, while gasoline stations witnessed a significant surge with a 5.2% increase in receipts. Sales at health &amp; personal care stores rose 0.5%, while food services &amp; drinking places saw a 0.3% increase.However, the picture was less optimistic for furniture and home furnishing stores, where sales decreased 1%. Sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments and bookstores reported a more substantial decline, with sales falling 1.6%. Miscellaneous stores also saw a decrease of 1.3%. Interestingly, non-store retailers reported unchanged sales last month, which may have been influenced by Amazon Prime Day sales events in July.Story continuesPast-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research4 Prominent PicksYou may invest in Urban Outfitters, Inc.

We also reviewed Dalio's top 10 stock picks in 2023. You can skip our detailed discussion about Ray Dalio and jump directly to the Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks.After stepping down from official roles last year, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is pursuing his passions and seeking to transfer his wisdom in various ways to help others succeed. He begins each day by closely monitoring the markets and spends 6 to 8 hours per day conducting research, which he refers to as ""digging."" The legendary investor, who founded Bridgewater Associates in his two-room apartment and grew it into one of the largest investment management firms with approximately $195 billion in assets under management, also frequently appears on news channels and YouTube videos. He also remains active on active on Twitter and other social platforms to present his stance on economic, political, and other global challenges. Although he stepped down as co-chief investment officer last year and no longer participates in day-to-day matters to pursue his passions, he still has a significant influence on Bridgewater's investing decisions. He is still on the operating board and serves as the investment committee's mentor. His ability to predict future market movements due to his strong understanding of macroeconomics and global world order has helped his firm make money over the last five decades. He had predicted the 2008 financial crisis as early as 2006. As his firm was well prepared for the impending financial crisis, its flagship Pure Alpha strategy was up 8.7% after fees in 2008. Besides that event, Dalio's firm has a history of making noteworthy moves. In 2022, his firm built over $10 billion in short positions in European stocks because of the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, in 2018, his firm opened $22 billion worth of short positions in Europe and made a $14 billion bet against European stocks in 2020. Story continuesMost recently, following his visit to China in April 2023, the American billionaire published a LinkedIn post about China-US tensions. He advised the world's two largest economies to maintain good political and trade relations because he believed even the prospects of war would be a drag on markets and global economic activity. However, he also warned that both countries are on the verge of war: What I mean when I say that the US and China are on the brink of war is that it appears that they are close to having a sanctions war and/or military war that neither side wants but many believe will probably happen because a) each side is very close to the other’s red lines, b) each side is using brinksmanship to push the other at the risk of crossing each other’s red lines, and c) politics will probably cause more aggressive brinksmanship over the next 18 months. I want to emphasize that by saying that they are on the brink, I don’t mean to say that they will necessarily go over the brink. I mean to say that they are very close to crossing red lines that, if crossed, will irrevocably push them over the brink into some type of war that damages these two countries and causes damage to the world order in severe and irrevocable ways—like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did for Russia and the world, just much bigger. Dalio has also been vocal about his long-held fascination with China. He is also well-liked in China, where his investment firm operates a wealth management business, becoming the largest foreign hedge fund last year with nearly $3 billion in investments, more than doubling the previous year. Since its inception in 2018, Bridgewater's main China fund has generated an annual return of 15.6% through October 2022. In one of his LinkedIn posts, he stated that the Chinese economy needs a big debt restructuring. However, he added that debt restructuring would be easier because the majority of its debt is in its own currency: So, how do those who reduce the debt burdens do it? It primarily depends on whether the debt is in one’s own currency or a foreign currency (if it’s in one’s own currency like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage) and whether it is held by one’s own citizens or foreigners (if it’s held by one’s own citizens like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage)—though it is never easy. Given these circumstances, it also depends on how the restructuring is done. A well-done restructuring happens in a balanced way. I call that a “beautiful deleveraging.” It balances deflationary defaults/restructurings with inflationary printing of money/debt monetization to spread out the burden. The mechanics of this process are explained in the first chapter of the book linked above, so I won’t try to squeeze them in here.While Bridgewater appears to be doing well in competitive Chinese markets, the firm is continuing to reduce its exposure to Chinese stocks listed on the US stock exchange. Ray Dalio's firm sold nearly a third of its stake in Chinese stocks during the second quarter. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) and Zhihu Inc. (NYSE:ZH) are among the 13 companies that the firm has exited in the second quarter. Dalio's Bridgewater held $480 million in 31 US-listed Chinese companies at the end of the June quarter. Meanwhile, the 13F filing also revealed that Dalio used exchange-traded funds such as the iShares MSCI China ETF and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF to diversify his exposure to China.  What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days - Top 10 Stock Picks in 2023Our MethodologyAs Ray Dalio continues to mentor the investment committee and his philosophy dominates investment moves, paying attention to Bridgewater's stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Bridgewater's second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days? - Top 10 Stock Picks in 202310. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $234 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 366Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been one of Ray Dalio's favorite stock holdings over the last decade, but the firm has significantly increased its position in the tech giant during the 2022 bear market when its shares were trading at a significantly lower price. Dalio's strategy of buying on the dip worked because Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares have risen by a whopping 50% year to date. The recovery in ad revenue, combined with a focus on AI technology, has increased investor confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). During the company's second-quarter conference call, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the importance of artificial intelligence, stating that the company is working to incorporate AI into its products.In the first half investor letter, Pershing Square Holdings, an investment holding company, explained the reasons for creating a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Here is what the firm stated about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG):“Earlier this year, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. We believe that Google is one of the world’s greatest businesses with deep barriers to entry and massive network effects underpinning its core search business. After having closely followed the company for many years, we had the opportunity to acquire a stake in Google at a highly attractive valuation as misplaced concerns over its competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and its strong growth prospects.Google is the dominant leader in the fast-growing digital advertising market. Google has 85%+ market share in search and, along with YouTube, approximately 50% share of the digital advertising market. With higher and improving returns on investment, we expect digital ads to continue to take market share from traditional ad formats like TV and print, and increasingly drive the total advertising market growth above its historical trend. For example, in retail, rising e-commerce penetration is catalyzing the migration of offline promotion and trade spend dollars into digital ads. With Search and YouTube as two of the highest return and most resilient ad formats, Google is well positioned to benefit from the structural growth in digital ad share across many categories.Similarly, in its Cloud business, Google is a top three player in an oligopolistic market that is in the early stages of a multi[1]year shift of IT workloads from on-premise to cloud and hybrid cloud solutions. These powerful secular tailwinds have enabled Google to grow overall revenues at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the last five years which should continue to support near- double-digit top-line growth in the coming years…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $241 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 175Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Ray Dalio's Bridgewater's strategy of increasing its stake in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) during last year's bear market has so far rewarded his firm. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock is up more than 24% year to date. Dalio's hedge fund maintained its confidence in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by holding nearly one million shares at the end of the June quarter, up 3% from the previous quarter. The latest financial results and outlook from the company indicate that there is still room for growth. Revenue of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) increased by 7% year over year in the June quarter, while earnings per share of $2.16 topped the estimate of $2.12. The second quarter earnings were also up from $2.09 in the previous quarter and $1.98 in the same period last year.   In the second quarter investor letter, Baron Funds, an investment management company, identified Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) as a high-conviction idea in their fund. Here is what the fund stated about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated, and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo, Visa announced its intention to acquire the Brazilian company for $1 billion in late June.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $269 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 60Bridgewater's strategy of buying stocks at low prices has worked in the case of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), as it has for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Throughout late 2020 and early 2021, Ray Dalio's fund steadily increased its position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Although the firm sold some stake in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in late 2022, it again raised its position in the coffeehouse company by 10% in the June quarter to 2.72 million shares. In addition to share price appreciation, Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) healthy dividend yield of 2.20% makes it an attractive stock to hold for the long term. However, some investment management firms are pessimistic about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) performance ahead. The London Company, an investment management company, stated in its second-quarter investor letter that uncertain market conditions could negatively impact the performance of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Here is what the firm said about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX):“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $402 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 83Ray Dalio's hedge fund has been selling its stake in Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) from approximately 4.7 million shares in the second quarter of 2022 to approximately 2.56 million shares at the end of the June quarter of 2023. Despite this, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is Ray Dalio's seventh largest stock holding, with a total value of $402 million. The fund appears to have benefited from its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) because shares of the company have risen sharply since it established its position in Q3 2020. Walmart Inc.

There, she learned that the largest casino owner in Las Vegas had fallen victim to a cybersecurity breach.Martinez, 45, immediately checked her bank statements for the credit card linked to her loyalty account. Now she was being greeted by four new transactions she did not recognize — charges that she said increased with each transaction, from $9.99 to $46. She canceled the credit card.Unsettled by the thought of what other information the hackers may have stolen, Martinez, a publicist from Los Angeles, said she signed up for a credit report monitoring program, which will cost her $20 monthly.“It’s been kind of an issue for me,” she said, “but I’m now monitoring my credit, and now I’m taking these extra steps.”MGM Resorts said the incident began Sunday, affecting reservations and casino floors in Las Vegas and other states. Videos on social media showed video slot machines that had gone dark. Some customers said their hotel room cards weren't working. Others said they were canceling their trips this weekend.The situation entered its sixth day on Friday, with booking capabilities still down and MGM Resorts offering penalty-free room cancelations through Sept. 17. Brian Ahern, a company spokesperson, declined Friday to answer questions from The Associated Press, including what information had been compromised in the breach.By Thursday, Caesars Entertainment — the largest casino owner in the world — confirmed it, too, had been hit by a cybersecurity attack. The casino giant said its casino and hotel computer operations weren't disrupted but couldn't say with certainty that personal information about tens of millions of its customers was secure following the data breach.Story continuesThe security attacks that triggered an FBI probe shatter a public perception that casino security requires an “Oceans 11”-level effort to defeat it.“When people think about security, they are thinking about the really big super-computers, firewalls, a lot of security systems,"" said Yoohwan Kim, a computer science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose expertise includes network security.It's true, Kim said, that casino giants like MGM Resorts and Caesars are protected by sophisticated — and expensive — security operations. But no system is perfect.“Hackers are always fighting for that 0.0001% weakness,” Kim said. “Usually, that weakness is human-related, like phishing.”Tony Anscombe, the chief security official with the San Diego-based cybersecurity company ESET, said it appears the invasions may have been carried out as a “socially engineered attack,” meaning the hackers used tactics like a phone call, text messages or phishing emails to breach the system.“Security is only as good as the weakest link, and unfortunately, as in many cyberattacks, human behavior is the method used by cybercriminals to gain the access to a company’s crown jewels,” Anscombe said.As the security break-ins left some Las Vegas casino floors deserted this week, a hacker group emerged online, claiming responsibility for the attack on Caesars Entertainment's systems and saying it had asked the company to pay a $30 million ransom fee.It has not officially been determined whether either of the affected companies paid a ransom to regain control of their data. But if one had done so, the experts said, then more attacks could be on the way.“If it happened to MGM, the same thing could happen to other properties, too,” said Kim, the UNLV professor. “Definitely more attacks will come. That’s why they have to prepare.”___Parry reported from Atlantic City. Associated Press videographer Ty O'Neil in Las Vegas contributed.]"

Last week, Caesars Entertainment’s (CZR) systems and user data were also reportedly attacked. Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Analyst Allan Liska breaks down the implications of these hacks and cybersecurity systems that can be set in place to avoid these types of attacks. Liska states these events could become “an investor confidence issue” and will lead these companies to beef up their cybersecurity, and most likely their physical on-site security as well. He cites the lack of proper social engineering training at most casinos, noting the attack did not appear to be complex and could make for very easy targets for hackers “with the right attitude.”Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Shares of MGM Resorts closing lower today as the casino giant battles a widespread system outage, five days after a cyber attack forced it to shut down systems at properties across the US. Guests reporting ATMs, slot machines, and digital room key cards remained out of order. This as Caesars Entertainment reported it was hit by a cyber attack last week that saw the personal data of its reward members compromised.The company acknowledged in an SEC filing that it couldn't guarantee the security of stolen information, putting millions at risk. With more on the potential fallout from these attacks, we've got Allan Liska, a threat security analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, here. Allan, the significance here of all three of these, or at least Caesars and MGM, being targeted in this fashion.ALLAN LISKA: Yeah, it's fairly significant. Casinos have been hit a number of times this year. We've seen multiple attacks against them, but nothing this big. And so having these kind of huge casinos being impacted, and not just the casinos but, as you pointed out, all of their clients and customers being impacted is huge.AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, six terabytes worth of data is what it's being reported out in terms of information that was stolen. What does this tell you about the security that's in place at these casinos, where, I mean, everything from your room key to your transaction, your winnings, all of that, is operated under this digital umbrella?Story continuesALLAN LISKA: Right. So casinos have traditionally invested very heavily in physical security, right? They want to make sure that their slot machines are safe. They want to make sure that nobody is card counting, that nobody can break into the system.They haven't invested as heavily in cybersecurity. But as we're finding out, so much of these casinos are network-based, right? As you say, the rooms the slot machines, all of your credit card information, all of your membership information is all stored digitally, and that's ripe for these kind of attacks and can be incredibly devastating to not only the patrons of the casino but to the casino themselves.BRAD SMITH: So, what type of hit on customer confidence does this typically have, after a cybersecurity breach like this?ALLAN LISKA: It depends. I mean, you saw the stock price for both casinos has been down this week. So there is an investor confidence issue. But then there's also a confidence issue in terms of the casino themselves. Is it safe to go back there?Now, the good news is, when an attack like this happens, there's almost always a heavy investment in security. So undoubtedly, both Caesars and MGM will be much more secure going forward, but they may have lost confidence in their-- the confidence of their customers. And, honestly, it also probably means that the other casinos on the strip are now heavily investing in cyber security as well to make sure that they don't fall victim.AKIKO FUJITA: Hey, Allan, I wonder what you make of the reports of how this, in fact, was carried out, that this was actually information that was obtained by a phone call, not necessarily, right-- I mean, hackers were able to use that information from the call to hack into the system. But it wasn't all just done on the internet. And I ask that because there's certainly a lot of education among companies across the country that have been put into letting employees know about what to look out for when there are criminals who are trying to hack into a system. I mean, this doesn't feel like it was that high tech.ALLAN LISKA: Most attacks aren't. Whether you're talking about a phishing attack over email, most of them aren't that complex to get in. And even most exploitations aren't that complex. That's kind of one of the dirty secrets of security, is too many things are missed. In this case, social engineering, when done well, can be really hard to defend against.Just a couple of weeks before these attacks at the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas, they had a whole social engineering village, where they were showing how easy it is to use social engineering to gain access. Because with the right script, the right voice, the right attitude, it is surprisingly easy to get help desk people to reset a password or to give you a multifactor authentication code. And that's where a lot of organizations don't extend the training to. They'll do phishing training, they'll do security awareness training, but they won't necessarily do social engineering training.BRAD SMITH: Where are we hearing generative AI could be, perhaps one of the larger solutions for cybersecurity? I mean, obviously, it's coming up in the industry, but it's a matter of-- at what cost for corporations are they going to have to kind of just make sure that they put up the dollars in order to not just have an added layer of cybersecurity but they're also being proactive within that measure as well?ALLAN LISKA: Right. Well, and that's the thing with generative AI that you need to think about, is it's not just a implement-it-and-forget-it kind of solution. There's a lot of care and feeding that goes into an AI-based solution to improve it and have it constantly be responsive to new threats and new kinds of attacks. And so just like with anything else in security, AI can be really helpful. But you have to have the staff, the resources, and the capabilities to manage it and maintain it, otherwise, it's just another tool sitting on your shelf, not being useful. But it can be very helpful in improving cybersecurity within an organization.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Allan, what about those users who were in Vegas, who are worried maybe their data has been targeted, maybe their data has been compromised? What are the steps they should be taking right now?ALLAN LISKA: You know, unfortunately, we have this conversation a lot, whether we're talking about schools that are hit with ransomware or hospitals that are hit with ransomware or now casinos that are hit with ransomware. It's the same conversation repeatedly that credit monitoring becomes really, really important here. Making sure that you are aware of any changes to your credit score, anybody trying to open new accounts, anybody trying to open new driver's licenses, et cetera. So having those credit monitoring services are really helpful. I wish I had a better answer than that, but that right now is the best solution that we have for these kind of attacks.BRAD SMITH: One of the reasons that we also see the stock price move in reaction to something like that is not just the original exposure but also the action that customers might take on the other side. Are you expecting some type of massive settlements in order to assuage customers who are impacted by this as a result of, and perhaps and are brewing up a class action lawsuit?ALLAN LISKA: Yeah. So any time we see a big ransomware attack like this, especially one that's in the news, you have at least two lawsuits that are filed. You'll have the shareholder class action lawsuit and you'll also have the impacted customers class action lawsuit. So, yeah, we expect to see both of those come forward in the next few weeks as things start to settle within MGM and within Caesars. But yeah, that's just par for the course at this point.BRAD SMITH: All right. Allan, thank you so much for your time and your insights on this matter. Of course, the story that we're going to be continuing to track in the falling action of it as well here. Allan Liska, appreciate the time.ALLAN LISKA: Thank you very much.]"

When Khan and her staff got to the front of the line, an employee at the desk asked them to write down their credit card information on a piece of paper.As the leader of the federal agency that, among other things, ensures companies protect consumer data wrote down her details, Khan asked the worker: How exactly was MGM managing the data security around this situation? The desk agent shrugged and said he didn’t know, according to a senior aide who was traveling with Khan and described the experience to Bloomberg as surreal.Khan was among the thousands of MGM hotel patrons inconvenienced in the aftermath of the hack, which was said to be orchestrated by a group of hackers known as Scattered Spider. Days after the incident, many of the company’s websites — including its reservation system — were still displaying error messages, some slot machines at its casinos across the country are still out of service and employees were handling processes manually.FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar confirmed on Friday that Khan was in Las Vegas to attend listening sessions on the proposed $24.6 billion merger of the grocery-story giants Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. He declined to say whether the agency would investigate MGM’s data security practices.Story continuesRead More: Group in Casino Hacks Skilled at Duping Workers for Access (1)Khan and the senior aide, who booked their reservations through a third-party site because MGM’s systems were down, didn’t receive a receipt, according to the aide.

NCLH will likely benefit from solid booking activities, digital initiatives and fleet expansion efforts. This and the focus on booking window extension bode well. However, a volatile macro environment is a headwind.Let us discuss why investors should hold on to the stock for now.Key CatalystsImprovements in booking activities have been aiding the company. The bookings include incorporating higher pricing and the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (FCCs). The company reported solid booking volumes during the second quarter, courtesy of a robust consumer demand environment. The company stated that the cumulative booked position for 2023 is higher than 2019 levels. Also, it reported strength in advance ticket sales. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company’s advance ticket sales balance came in at $3.5 billion, reflecting a rise of $167 million (from the previous quarter’s levels) and 56% (from 2019 levels). The company stated pricing levels to be elevated. The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods.The company emphasizes its booking window to drive the top line. The initiative not only evaluates the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel but also provides better visibility for price increases and moderating marketing expenses. During the second quarter, the company extended its booking window by 51 days (or 20% compared with 2019 levels) to enhance future visibility and reduce exposure to volatile bookings. The company anticipates the indicator as a driving factor in the upcoming periods.Increased focus on digital initiatives bodes well. During the second quarter of 2023, the company created a simplified booking process that employs generative AI technology to personalize the experience for visitors. The initiative paves a path for optimization in pricing and marketing approaches. It is optimistic concerning the strategies and anticipates it to increase yields, guest satisfaction and guest repeat rates.Story continuesNorwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size to drive growth. It plans to introduce eight more ships through 2028. Most are on order for the Norwegian Cruise Line, while the rest are for Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. The Regent brand has one Explorer Class Ship to be delivered in 2023. The company has one Allura Class Ships for the Oceania Cruises brand to be delivered in 2025. The Norwegian brand has five Prima Class Ships on order, with scheduled delivery dates from 2023 through 2028. The company’s new build pipeline is likely to pave a path for 50% capacity growth by 2028, registering a CAGR of approximately 5% (from 2019 levels).ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past three months, shares of the company have declined 9.7% compared with the industry’s fall of 5.5%. The company’s operations are likely to be influenced by the volatility in inflation, rising fuel prices and rising interest rates. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment.Norwegian Cruise has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time now. During the second quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses came in at $1,383.6 million compared with $1,073.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The company reported a rise in payroll, fuel and direct variable costs of fully-operating ships. The company anticipates inflation and global supply chain constraints to pressure margins in the near term. Also, it is cautious of increased fuel and capacity additions expense.

But there's likely good news ahead for consumers: Analysts think prices will come down due to use of winter-grade gasoline, which costs less to make.Barring significant disruptions from Hurricane Lee, Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at OPIS, told Yahoo Finance, gas prices are likely peaking. He added that ""we'll likely see prices ease a bit at the pump even if crude stays in the $90/bbl neighborhood.""Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates echoed a similar sentiment.""In the next five days I expect gasoline prices to tick on up a few cents, but afterwards consumers east of the Rockies will benefit from the lower priced winter-grade gasoline and we should see about a $0.10 per gallon decline in those markets,"" Lipow told Yahoo Finance.The exception would be California, where the average price of gasoline currently hovers around $5.52 per gallon.""Unfortunately if you are in California, the winter-grade gasoline does not go into the distribution system until Nov. 1,"" added Lipow.Gas prices on display at a petrol station in La Puente, Calif. on Sept. 7, 2023.

On Thursday, Delta (DAL) warned of lower profits due to higher maintenance and jet fuel costs. The airline now expects a quarterly earning in the range of $1.85 to $2.05 per share, versus a prior forecast of $2.20 to $2.50.American (AAL), Spirit (SAVE), United (UAL), Southwest (LUV), and Alaska Air (ALK) recently issued similar warnings, too.Crude has been on an upward trend over the past three months. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) rose by about $22 per barrel since late June to just above $90 per barrel this week.Brent crude futures (BZ=F) have seen a similar rise of more than 30% over the same period, hovering at above $93 per barrel on Friday.""I expect crude oil prices to remain above $90 per barrel as OPEC+, and specifically Saudi Arabia, seek higher prices to balance their domestic budget,"" added Lipow.Oil's recent rally prompted RBC Capital Markets to float the possibility of $100 per barrel amid ""a momentum-based"" market.“The notion of $100/bbl has evolved from completely unimaginable a few short months ago, to within striking (or hyping) distance today,” analysts Michael Tran and Helima Croft wrote in a note to investors.Saudi Arabia recently extended its unilateral production cuts for the next three months. Russia also reduced its exports by 300,000 barrels per day through year-end.

Until the end of September, members of Offshore Alliance, a coalition of two unions, can now strike for up to 24 hours each day and refuse tasks such as loading LNG tankers.The company's Gorgon and Wheatstone Australian LNG facilities account for over 5% of global supply.""Chevron’s 3 West Coast facilities are descending into chaos as Offshore Alliance members lock all 3 Chevron facilities down for the next 24-hours,"" the union said in a Facebook post.An union representative, who declined to be identified, said the strike would run until 8am WST on Sunday (0000 GMT). Meetings would be held twice daily to decide on further strikes.The representative also said the unions would file notice with Chevron that they intend to extend industrial action for a further two weeks to mid-October.Chevron has asked Australia's industrial tribunal tointervene in the disputeand cancel the strikes. The tribunal will hold a hearing on Friday and a decision is expected shortly after.A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment on the union's Facebook post. The company has previously said it would not provide ongoing comments on the strikes but would take steps to maintain operations in the event of disruptions.An outage at the Wheatstone facility on Thursday cut LNG production by about a quarter. A spokesperson said on Saturday that restart activities were continuing. It is not clear if the strikes are disrupting the resumption of full production.Unions have said they will vary strikes according to ""industrial strategy"", targeting LNG exports in particular.Analysts say the strikes pose little risk to global LNG supplies as they are likely to be temporary and key gas buyers have plenty of inventory ahead of the northern winter.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels and Llama 2, is likely to aid prospects.However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes.

Walmart strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has been especially rewarding.This is evident from the constant increase in the market share for groceries, which boosted U.S. comparable sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. During the quarter, the top and bottom lines grew year over year, encouraging management to raise its guidance for fiscal 2024. Strong comp sales growth globally and e-commerce growth across all units were upsides.While the gross margin increased year over year, it was partly hurt by an adverse category mix, which is likely to linger in the third quarter. Management also expects variable pay expenses to increase year over year in the third quarter.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +7.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +19.5%.

The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.

However, operations are being hurt by supply chain disruptions.BCE To Benefit From Growing Demand for PureFibre and 5GPer the Zacks analyst, BCE will benefit from increased demand for its PureFibre and 5G wireless network.

Over the last five days, the utilities sector ETF XLU has far outperformed all the others.I think it is quite clear that large institutions are positioning themselves for the coming volatility.Consolidated Water CWCO, FirstEnergy FE, and Vistra VST are top ranked utility stocks that investors should consider if they are focused on reducing high risk exposure during the coming few weeks.KoyfinImage Source: KoyfinConsolidated WaterConsolidated Water is a company that specializes in developing and operating seawater desalination plants and water distribution systems in areas of the world where naturally occurring supplies of potable water are scarce or unavailable. Founded in the Cayman Islands in 1973, CWCO uses reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater into fresh water. This fresh water is then supplied to industrial, commercial, and residential customers. Their operations primarily span across the Caribbean region and other locations.Complementing its already strong YTD performance Consolidate Water also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.

59,2a2ca55c-8258-3510-857b-2daad658380f,CRM,2023-09-16,"Salesforce hirings, DoorDash's move to Nasdaq, TSMC delays: Top stocks",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/salesforce-hirings-doordashs-move-nasdaq-212404939.html,1694813044,VIDEO,"['DASH', 'TSM', 'TSMWF', '^IXIC', 'CRM']","[Salesforce (CRM) shares are slightly lower today in response to reports of their plans to hire 3,300 new employees across various departments. This move comes in the wake of the company's decision to reduce its workforce by 10% earlier this year. DoorDash (DASH) trends lower after MoffettNathanson analysts downgraded the stock from an ""Outperform"" rating to ""Market Perform."" This news comes ahead of the company's plans to re-list its stock on the NASDAQ (^IXIC) on Sept. 27th. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares slip after reportedly telling suppliers to expect postponed deliveries due to a lack of demand.Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith and Akiko Fujita break down the top stocks of the day.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Salesforce, down nearly 2% today. Bloomberg reporting the cloud-based software firm is hiring 3,300 people across various departments-- a change of tone from the company. Earlier this year, remember they eliminated 10% of its workforce.And, Brad, as soon as I saw this thinking back to the conversations that our very own Brian Sozzi had out at Dreamforce, how many times did he talk about those boomerang employees-- those employees that were maybe laid off earlier on the year, maybe left the company last year-- Salesforce really making an effort to try and bring those employees back largely because they see opportunities in huge expansion. AI certainly a big one, but they've also talked about sales, engineering.So Salesforce sees a lot of opportunities there. Interesting stock move, although we've often seen the hiring correlated with a leg down in terms of the stock because of the costs associated with that.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. With some of the major ambitions that they laid out at Dreamforce this week, that as you mentioned our own executive editor Brian Sozzi was hearing directly from, if you will, the horse's mouth.But we'll be more kind and generous and say the genius the, leader that is Marc Benioff as well, the CEO of Salesforce, as well as some of the CEOs of subsidiaries within there at Slack, particularly when Slack came up in the conversation in the chat as one of the leading plays that Salesforce would have in AI. They said that Slack would really lead that charge among some of their tools and application services that they offer out to their portfolio clients.Story continuesBut for where Salesforce is also going to look to expand here, it's in partnerships. They're expanding through a partnership that they already have with Google to deliver this new era that they're calling a business productivity powered by generative AI.So a larger kind of indication of where we've already seen some of the mega-cap tech companies decide how they're going to carve out their space through partnerships to maintain their own kind of market share, even as this new wave of generative AI investments has accelerated, had lighter fluid essentially pouring on it over the past several quarters here and especially over the course of this year.AKIKO FUJITA: All right. Let's move on to another soccer watching. DoorDash seeing-- let's see where the stock ended. There you go. Down about 2.5%. So MoffettNathanson analyst downgrading DoorDash from outperform to market perform, citing the return of student loan payments to take a bite out of their revenue. A number-- DoorDash also announcing it's transferring its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the NASDAQ. They will officially make the move on September 27.Brad, worth noting some numbers in this report. The average student loan consumer is about to experience a 14% to 19% hit to discretionary spending. And, of course, you know, DoorDash isn't the only company that's going to get hit. We've heard the impact from student loan repayments from other companies throughout earnings calls. But this line here. What happens when 43 million Americans see an average of $225 a month come out of their pockets in October? This is from that MoffettNathanson report.Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, right? And when you think about the user base for DoorDash, monthly active users aged 25 to 44, 65% of those users fall within that age group. And those are likely to take the biggest hit when those student loan repayments resume in October.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. So layer on that DoorDash usership figure that you mentioned there and the demographic that they go after and the core user base that really accounts for much of the activity with this federal data that the analysts also had layered in here. People aged 24 to 49 hold 69% of the nation's student loan debt.So you kind combine these two things together and it really spells out a discretionary food spending storm that is brewing at this point in time and is set to hit the coast of DoorDash and perhaps some of the other delivery businesses here. We're looking at Uber we're looking, of course, across the broader spectrum of these services that have really, really made sure that they can continue to attract mindshare on not just the convenience factor, but also making sure that they're growing out the amount of merchants that they work with as well.So the amount of cuisines, the amount of large national partnerships that they're able to bring on. That's something that they've used as a selling point, but what now? And so we'll see exactly how that effects in terms of the student loan repayments-- the number of people that are hop skipping jumping or just kind of loading up the app as I do when I get bored and also just when I'm lazy and don't want to--AKIKO FUJITA: I just ordered my lunch from DoorDash today.BRAD SMITH: Did you? OK.AKIKO FUJITA: I did. I did--Oh, there's some recs.AKIKO FUJITA: --for the showBRAD SMITH: All right. Let's talk about Taiwan Semiconductor here as well. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ends the day down by 2.4%. This is the world's largest third-party semiconductor manufacturer, telling its major suppliers to delay deliveries amid slowing demand. That's according to a Reuters report here. This comes just a week after the company said its August revenue fell 13.5% from last year.Just briefly as well here, according to the report companies affected by the instruction to delay supplier shipments into Taiwan Semiconductor, it includes ASML-- that's the lithography equipment that is necessary for some of the chipmaking-- the high-end chipmaking according to sources within this story as well.AKIKO FUJITA: So it wasn't just TSMC hit by this today. A number of their other competitors as well, that those stocks moving a leg lower. But I think it's kind of interesting that the contrast with what we're hearing from Wall Street analysts in terms of what this all means. Citi's analysts saying this is no new news. They said any pullback in the chip equipment subsector or the sector would be a buying opportunity.You had Jefferies analysts saying that they still have some of these chipmakers, chip equipment suppliers as well as their top picks. So while we are seeing that pullback today, certainly the long-term investment case, at least among some Wall Street analysts, appear to be holding steady.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, great point there.]"
60,f58f1184-99ee-303a-ada7-c63af23ec1cc,CRM,2023-09-16,"Journey into the heart of Dreamforce, where AI and A-list acts collide",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/journey-heart-dreamforce-where-ai-180623951.html,1694801183,STORY,['CRM'],"[Hi folks, Kylie Robison from the tech team. I just wrapped up a week at Dreamforce, the annual technology conference put on by Salesforce, which this year featured everything from moshing mascots to Matthew McConaughey.If you’re not familiar with Dreamforce, it's essentially Disneyland for CRM software enthusiasts. This year's star-studded spectacle had about 40,000 attendees and included performances by heavyweights like Dave Matthews, Maggie Rogers, Demi Lovato, and The Foo Fighters. As for why a software company might pay millions for Dave Grohl to sell their products, well, I don’t know. I’m just happy for the free concert.Upon my arrival, I couldn't help but wonder why I had willingly embarked on a career that involved navigating through a sea of sweaty, Cotopaxi-clad tech bros. When the keynote event reached max capacity and the entrance was locked down, disgruntled attendees voiced their displeasure (some even arguing with security) about missing what was essentially a 2-hour long pitch on Salesforce’s new AI products.One big difference this year compared to last year's event is that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff no longer has a co-CEO, after Bret Taylor abruptly announced his resignation in November. In a press panel this week, I asked Benioff the burning question of his plans for succession, a move that earned me a scolding from one of the countless PR people present. In true Benioff style, he sidestepped the question entirely, offering a cryptic response about simply having the best time.While the Taylor-sized hole was certainly felt on stage, Benioff wasn’t kidding about having a great time. Against the backdrop of a rocket ship-riding cartoon Einstein, zipping around giant screens to announce the new “Einstein Copilot"" AI assistant, Benioff launched into a spiel about the exciting yet perilous landscape of artificial intelligence.“These things are good but they’re not great, you know? They have a lot of answers that aren’t exactly true. We call them hallucinations. I call them lies,” Benioff said in his keynote. “These LLMs are very convincing liars. They really are, it’s amazing. And of course, they can turn very toxic very quickly.”Story continuesBenioff, along with the aforementioned chorus line of Salesforce PR folks, are on a fervent mission to ensure you're acutely aware of their formidable presence in the AI arena. Benioff claimed in his keynote that Salesforce “is the No. 1 artificial intelligence platform used around the world,” someone on his team called this the “world’s largest AI event.”The pivot to AI came across as not just forced but completely over the top, though I suppose I shouldn't have anticipated anything less from the company spending $10 million a year on employing Matthew McConaughey. When I expressed these thoughts to Anshu Sharma, a former Salesforce VP and now CEO of data privacy startup Skyflow, he explained that while Salesforce’s pivot to AI is certainly extravagant, it isn’t exactly illogical.“If there’s been 10 great tech breakthroughs in the last 10 years, Salesforce has been on top of 12 of them,” Sharma told me. “Marc Benioff is a genius, and one thing I learned from him is that betting on a new thing has limited downside if you are wrong and unlimited upside if you are right about something like cloud, mobile, or now maybe AI.”Certainly, diving headfirst into the realm of AI is far from the worst bandwagon to hop onto, especially when you compare it to some past endeavors (like their Yammer clone, Chatter). This year, Salesforce fully committed to the bit, bringing onstage OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, and Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue. Also, Seth Meyers and Kristen Bell for some reason.Amidst all the AI buzz, the most conspicuous departure from last year's Dreamforce is the fact that this is Benioff's first Dreamforce since laying off 10% of its staff following pressure from activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value, which were pushing for major cost-cutting. Salesforce also announced in January it aims to reduce its costs by as much as $3 billion to $5 billion by reducing its number of offices.When I spoke to my sources about how they feel about this year’s Dreamforce, one explained “the bitter taste” in their mouth that Salesforce would spend buckets of money to hire big acts “when they’re still banging the whole ‘year of efficiency’ BS on Slack.”Indeed, thanks to the immense cuts mostly at the expense of employees, Salesforce's ""Ohana"" culture has taken a beating in the past year. However, it's abundantly clear that Benioff harbors a steadfast belief in his ability to emerge victorious in the ever-accelerating AI race. Despite the workforce cuts, Salesforce's chat subsidiary, Slack, set its sights on rehiring former staff in June, all in pursuit of stoking the fires of its generative AI aspirations. And Benioff told Bloomberg that Salesforce plans to hire thousands, including many “boomerangs,” who previously worked at the company.In the grand scheme of things, Dreamforce unfolded precisely as anticipated—a splendid spectacle of self-congratulation and opulence. My fingers are crossed that the AI boom outshines the other trends in Salesforce's storied history, leaving the Chatter era in the shadows where it belongs.Kylie RobisonWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

(CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-130011096.html,1694782811,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.05 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.02 points to a change of +53.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.32 indicates a change of +16.2% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $34.74 billion and $38.59 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.5% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.93%. The EPS surprise was +11.58%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we’ve made the very difficult decision to reduce our workforce by about 10%, mostly over the coming weeks,” Benioff wrote in an email to staff at the time.He blamed the layoffs on overhiring during the pandemic when tech companies were experiencing a boost in profits before the economy took a turn for the worse.But now, the company—which just posted better-than-expected results in Q2—is betting on artificial intelligence to further grow its bottom line.While it’s unclear which roles at Salesforce were made redundant earlier this year, around a third of the new hires will be working on the company’s data cloud product.Story continuesThe San Francisco-based company recently introduced Einstein GPT, a generative AI tool aimed at enhancing sales, marketing, and customer service agents’ efficiency. It’s also actively developing a myriad of other “GPTs,” according to a Salesforce blog post, including Sales GPT, Service GPT, Marketing GPT, Commerce GPT, Slack GPT, and Tableau GPT.“We have some very successful parts of our business right now, and we want a surge in those areas,” its chief operating officer Brian Millham told Bloomberg.It comes just a few months after Salesforce’s subsidiary Slack announced it was looking to hire a “significant number of new roles” in Q3 on the product development engineer team, in a memo viewed by Fortune—with these roles set to be focused on generative AI.Salesforce didn't respond to Fortune's request for comment.Boomerang workers are on the riseIt’s not just former Salesforce workers who are being tempted to go back to their ex (employer)—""boomeranging"" is on the rise across the board.Numerous studies show that businesses have seen a surge in former staffers reaching out and reapplying for the jobs they quit, having regretted jumping on the Great Resignation bandwagon.Payroll company Paychecks surveyed American workers and found that 80% of employees who left their jobs during The Great Resignation now regret it. Meanwhile, UKG’s research across six counties similarly found that 43% of people who resigned admitted they were better off at their previous employer.In the end, both studies revealed that only about a quarter of employees returned to their previous employers but that’s not for a lack of trying—a whopping 68% of respondents in the former study attempted to get their old jobs back.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

65,93f10478-a931-3f45-acc6-0f5f7b9a4e12,MRO,2023-09-16,US Crude Oil Tops $90 a Barrel — and These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks Are Poised to Reap the Rewards,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-crude-oil-tops-90-193700690.html,1694806620,STORY,"['MRO', 'FANG']","[Consumers took two hits in the pocketbook this past week. First came the August inflation numbers, with the headline annualized rate rising from 3.2% to 3.7%. And on the heels of that came news that US crude oil, the WTI benchmark price, jumped above $90 per barrel for the first time since last November and is currently trading at $91.05.That increase marks the latest in a series of oil price increases this year. WTI is up 40% from the low point it hit in March of this year and shows a total year-to-date gain of 13.5%. The rising prices are commonly attributed to the general spike in the global crude price, stemming from decisions by Russia and Saudi Arabia to extend production cuts through the end of this year.The rising price of oil will make a politically radioactive mix with rising inflation, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain – or even boost – high-interest rates despite the risk of recession.But increased oil prices will also bring opportunities, particularly for energy sector investors, as oil stocks are positioned to gain from rising prices of their chief product.5-star analyst John Freeman, from Raymond James, has been following that line, and his recent two ‘Strong Buy’ picks are worth a closer look. These are both oil stocks with heavy exposure to the US oil patch, and each has solid upside potential for the coming year. Let’s take a closer look.Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)First up is Marathon Oil, a long-standing stalwart in North America’s oil industry. As a direct business descendant of Standard Oil, Marathon, in its current incarnation, boasts a $16.5 billion market cap and realized more than $7.5 billion in revenues last year. The company’s primary activities revolve around hydrocarbon exploration and production. Marathon Oil’s operations focus on high-production basins, including the Delaware and Eagle Ford formations in Texas and the Bakken fields in North Dakota. The company is also developing promising assets in Equatorial Guinea.Story continuesMarathon Oil’s asset base is well-balanced between oil and natural gas, and the company has a history of generating profits for investors. The independent E&amp;P firm is also committed to providing capital returns through both share repurchases and dividends.Marathon Oil repurchased $372 million worth of stock in the quarter and paid out $62 million in dividends. The common stock dividend, at 10 cents per share, provides a modest yield of 1.46%. The company has been steadily increasing the payment for several years.Turning to John Freeman’s view, we find the analyst bullish on Marathon Oil, pointing out that the company has been beating production estimates and that the stock appears undervalued.“As a recap regarding their 2Q results, MRO easily exceeded estimates due to stronger liquids production and indicated 3Q production should be above midpoint of guidance. MRO maintains the most aggressive buyback program within our coverage and as a result sees very strong per-share growth despite targeting a flat production profile. Equatorial Guinea still provides huge upside for next year, which we are modeling quite conservatively given the volatility in natural gas prices, even so we are modeling an impact to net income of ~$480M thanks to the change in 2024. MRO’s 2024 FCF estimate of 18% vs. 8% average in our coverage universe and multiple of 3.4x vs 5.5x coverage average puts them among the most undervalued names in our coverage,” Freeman opined.Looking ahead, the Raymond James analyst gives this stock a Strong Buy rating, and his price target, raised from $40 to $45, implies a one-year upside for the shares of 68%. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here)The Street, generally, is also bullish here. MRO gets a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 16 analyst reviews with a breakdown of 13 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. MRO shares are priced at $26.84 and their $32.75 average price target suggests they will increase by 22% in the year ahead. (See MRO stock forecast)Diamondback Energy (FANG)Next up is Diamondback Energy, another independent oil and gas E&amp;P firm operating in the Texas oil patch. Diamondback specializes in unconventional onshore plays, producing both crude oil and natural gas. The company is involved in acquiring, exploring, developing, and exploiting these resources, employing horizontal drilling techniques to maximize well efficiency.Diamondback primarily operates in the Permian Basin, located in its home state of Texas, which is one of North America’s largest oil basins. The company has consistently delivered strong production figures, with recent months showing significant growth. In the second quarter of this year, Diamondback achieved a daily average production of 449,912 barrels of oil equivalent, marking a 5.8% increase compared to the previous quarter and a robust 18% year-over-year rise.Notably, Diamondback remains steadfast in its commitment to delivering value to its shareholders. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $321 million worth of common shares as part of a $473 million total capital return program. This program represented approximately 86% of the free cash flow and included base dividend payments. The Q2 dividend, paid on August 17, amounted to 84 cents per common share, annualizing to $3.36 and yielding 2.1%. Importantly, Diamondback has consistently met its quarterly dividend obligations since 2018Freeman’s comments on Diamondback are all about the company’s forward prospects. He notes that production guidance is going up, and writes, “FANG’s outlook has steadily improved since the beginning of the year, both increasing production guidance while decreasing capital expenditures. Perhaps most notable is the quarter over quarter decrease in capex expected from 3Q to 4Q ($~675M to $~595M) with Diamondback stating that this 4Q figure stands to be their baseline run-rate for 2024. As a result, we adjusted our 2024 capex lower by 4% from $2.7M to $2.6M. All-in-all we are expecting an increase to 2024 free cash flow yield from ~10% to 13% due to the commodity strip and production adjustments. FANG maintains a strong balance sheet and excellent shareholder return framework (75% FCF returned to shareholders), as such we reiterate our Strong Buy rating.”That Strong Buy rating comes along with a $191 price target, showing the analyst’s confidence in a 23% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on Diamondback shares. 13 Buys and 1 Sell issued over the previous three months make the stock a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $175.64 average price target suggests ~13% upside from current levels.

Tinubu will meet Nick Clegg, president of Global Affairs for Meta technologies, and the global CEOs of General Electric and Exxon Mobil, the statement said.Tinubu is scheduled to leave Nigeria on Sunday for the annual gathering of world leaders, which runs from Sept. 18 to Sept. 26.Tinubu met U.S. President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in India last week after accepting Biden's invitation to meet while they are both attending the General Assembly.""The president is focused on attracting foreign direct investment, attracting jobs, attracting new tax revenues into the shores of our country,"" Ngelale's statement said.""But he's also focused in on making sure that homegrown Nigerian companies have fair and equal access to foreign and international markets.""Ngelale said Tinubu will meet leaders from the United States, Brazil, Algeria, Comoros, South Africa and European Union. He will also meet the prime ministers of the Netherlands and Spain and the King of Jordan, Ngelale said.Nigeria's new government wants to encourage investments rather than rely on borrowing to create jobs as it tries to revive an economy struggling with record debt, a weak currency, double-digit inflation and skeletal power supplies.Tinubu has embarked on the boldest reforms in decades, which have been welcomed by investors. However, they have brought additional hardship to Nigerians already dealing with a cost of living crisis. Nigeria's inflation soared to an 18-year high in August.

We also reviewed Dalio's top 10 stock picks in 2023. You can skip our detailed discussion about Ray Dalio and jump directly to the Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks.After stepping down from official roles last year, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is pursuing his passions and seeking to transfer his wisdom in various ways to help others succeed. He begins each day by closely monitoring the markets and spends 6 to 8 hours per day conducting research, which he refers to as ""digging."" The legendary investor, who founded Bridgewater Associates in his two-room apartment and grew it into one of the largest investment management firms with approximately $195 billion in assets under management, also frequently appears on news channels and YouTube videos. He also remains active on active on Twitter and other social platforms to present his stance on economic, political, and other global challenges. Although he stepped down as co-chief investment officer last year and no longer participates in day-to-day matters to pursue his passions, he still has a significant influence on Bridgewater's investing decisions. He is still on the operating board and serves as the investment committee's mentor. His ability to predict future market movements due to his strong understanding of macroeconomics and global world order has helped his firm make money over the last five decades. He had predicted the 2008 financial crisis as early as 2006. As his firm was well prepared for the impending financial crisis, its flagship Pure Alpha strategy was up 8.7% after fees in 2008. Besides that event, Dalio's firm has a history of making noteworthy moves. In 2022, his firm built over $10 billion in short positions in European stocks because of the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, in 2018, his firm opened $22 billion worth of short positions in Europe and made a $14 billion bet against European stocks in 2020. Story continuesMost recently, following his visit to China in April 2023, the American billionaire published a LinkedIn post about China-US tensions. He advised the world's two largest economies to maintain good political and trade relations because he believed even the prospects of war would be a drag on markets and global economic activity. However, he also warned that both countries are on the verge of war: What I mean when I say that the US and China are on the brink of war is that it appears that they are close to having a sanctions war and/or military war that neither side wants but many believe will probably happen because a) each side is very close to the other’s red lines, b) each side is using brinksmanship to push the other at the risk of crossing each other’s red lines, and c) politics will probably cause more aggressive brinksmanship over the next 18 months. I want to emphasize that by saying that they are on the brink, I don’t mean to say that they will necessarily go over the brink. I mean to say that they are very close to crossing red lines that, if crossed, will irrevocably push them over the brink into some type of war that damages these two countries and causes damage to the world order in severe and irrevocable ways—like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did for Russia and the world, just much bigger. Dalio has also been vocal about his long-held fascination with China. He is also well-liked in China, where his investment firm operates a wealth management business, becoming the largest foreign hedge fund last year with nearly $3 billion in investments, more than doubling the previous year. Since its inception in 2018, Bridgewater's main China fund has generated an annual return of 15.6% through October 2022. In one of his LinkedIn posts, he stated that the Chinese economy needs a big debt restructuring. However, he added that debt restructuring would be easier because the majority of its debt is in its own currency: So, how do those who reduce the debt burdens do it? It primarily depends on whether the debt is in one’s own currency or a foreign currency (if it’s in one’s own currency like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage) and whether it is held by one’s own citizens or foreigners (if it’s held by one’s own citizens like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage)—though it is never easy. Given these circumstances, it also depends on how the restructuring is done. A well-done restructuring happens in a balanced way. I call that a “beautiful deleveraging.” It balances deflationary defaults/restructurings with inflationary printing of money/debt monetization to spread out the burden. The mechanics of this process are explained in the first chapter of the book linked above, so I won’t try to squeeze them in here.While Bridgewater appears to be doing well in competitive Chinese markets, the firm is continuing to reduce its exposure to Chinese stocks listed on the US stock exchange. Ray Dalio's firm sold nearly a third of its stake in Chinese stocks during the second quarter. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) and Zhihu Inc. (NYSE:ZH) are among the 13 companies that the firm has exited in the second quarter. Dalio's Bridgewater held $480 million in 31 US-listed Chinese companies at the end of the June quarter. Meanwhile, the 13F filing also revealed that Dalio used exchange-traded funds such as the iShares MSCI China ETF and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF to diversify his exposure to China.  What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days - Top 10 Stock Picks in 2023Our MethodologyAs Ray Dalio continues to mentor the investment committee and his philosophy dominates investment moves, paying attention to Bridgewater's stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Bridgewater's second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days? - Top 10 Stock Picks in 202310. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $234 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 366Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been one of Ray Dalio's favorite stock holdings over the last decade, but the firm has significantly increased its position in the tech giant during the 2022 bear market when its shares were trading at a significantly lower price. Dalio's strategy of buying on the dip worked because Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares have risen by a whopping 50% year to date. The recovery in ad revenue, combined with a focus on AI technology, has increased investor confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). During the company's second-quarter conference call, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the importance of artificial intelligence, stating that the company is working to incorporate AI into its products.In the first half investor letter, Pershing Square Holdings, an investment holding company, explained the reasons for creating a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Here is what the firm stated about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG):“Earlier this year, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. We believe that Google is one of the world’s greatest businesses with deep barriers to entry and massive network effects underpinning its core search business. After having closely followed the company for many years, we had the opportunity to acquire a stake in Google at a highly attractive valuation as misplaced concerns over its competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and its strong growth prospects.Google is the dominant leader in the fast-growing digital advertising market. Google has 85%+ market share in search and, along with YouTube, approximately 50% share of the digital advertising market. With higher and improving returns on investment, we expect digital ads to continue to take market share from traditional ad formats like TV and print, and increasingly drive the total advertising market growth above its historical trend. For example, in retail, rising e-commerce penetration is catalyzing the migration of offline promotion and trade spend dollars into digital ads. With Search and YouTube as two of the highest return and most resilient ad formats, Google is well positioned to benefit from the structural growth in digital ad share across many categories.Similarly, in its Cloud business, Google is a top three player in an oligopolistic market that is in the early stages of a multi[1]year shift of IT workloads from on-premise to cloud and hybrid cloud solutions. These powerful secular tailwinds have enabled Google to grow overall revenues at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the last five years which should continue to support near- double-digit top-line growth in the coming years…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $241 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 175Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Ray Dalio's Bridgewater's strategy of increasing its stake in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) during last year's bear market has so far rewarded his firm. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock is up more than 24% year to date. Dalio's hedge fund maintained its confidence in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by holding nearly one million shares at the end of the June quarter, up 3% from the previous quarter. The latest financial results and outlook from the company indicate that there is still room for growth. Revenue of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) increased by 7% year over year in the June quarter, while earnings per share of $2.16 topped the estimate of $2.12. The second quarter earnings were also up from $2.09 in the previous quarter and $1.98 in the same period last year.   In the second quarter investor letter, Baron Funds, an investment management company, identified Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) as a high-conviction idea in their fund. Here is what the fund stated about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated, and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo, Visa announced its intention to acquire the Brazilian company for $1 billion in late June.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $269 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 60Bridgewater's strategy of buying stocks at low prices has worked in the case of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), as it has for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Throughout late 2020 and early 2021, Ray Dalio's fund steadily increased its position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Although the firm sold some stake in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in late 2022, it again raised its position in the coffeehouse company by 10% in the June quarter to 2.72 million shares. In addition to share price appreciation, Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) healthy dividend yield of 2.20% makes it an attractive stock to hold for the long term. However, some investment management firms are pessimistic about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) performance ahead. The London Company, an investment management company, stated in its second-quarter investor letter that uncertain market conditions could negatively impact the performance of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Here is what the firm said about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX):“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $402 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 83Ray Dalio's hedge fund has been selling its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) over the last few quarters in order to capitalize on the share price gains it has generated over the last three years. The firm reduced its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from approximately 4.7 million shares in the second quarter of 2022 to approximately 2.56 million shares at the end of the June quarter of 2023. Despite this, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is Ray Dalio's seventh largest stock holding, with a total value of $402 million. The fund appears to have benefited from its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) because shares of the company have risen sharply since it established its position in Q3 2020. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), pays out healthy dividends. It is a dividend aristocrat with a 49-year dividend growth history. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was in the 81 hedge funds in the second quarter, according to data tracked by Insider Monkey. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater is among the largest hedge fund investors in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).6. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $423 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been a major stockholding of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates over the last three years. In the third quarter of 2020, the firm began building a stake in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and by early 2022, its stake had grown to 2.1 million shares. However, since then, Dalio’s firm has been lowering its stake in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to capitalize on the recent share price rally and allocate money to other opportunities. Despite this, the firm still held 1.4 million shares of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) valued at $423 million as of the end of the June quarter, making it the portfolio's sixth largest holding. Like  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is also among the best dividend payers. It has raised dividends in the past 21 consecutive years.  McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was in 68 hedge fund portfolios as of the end of the second quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is among the largest shareholders in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Click to continue reading and see Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks in 2023.     Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Reddit10 Best Silver ETFs15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDDisclosure: None.

HST recently announced a 20% hike in its cash dividend payment to 18 cents per share for the third quarter of 2023 from 15 cents paid out earlier. The move is aimed at enhancing its shareholders’ wealth.The increased dividend will be paid out on Oct 16 to shareholders on record as of Sep 30. With this latest hike, HST’s annual dividend yield now comes to 4.42% based on the company’s share price of $16.26 on Sep 14, 2023. Moreover, the company has increased its dividend six times in the last five years. Check out Host Hotels &amp; Resorts’ dividend history here.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust (REIT) investors, and Host Hotels has remained committed to that. After a brief suspension of its dividend payments during the pandemic, the company reinstated its dividend payment and resorted to regular dividend hikes. Even though the reinstated amount of 3 cents was lower than its pre-pandemic level of 20 cents, the company’s recent spate of dividend increases has been encouraging.Host Hotels owns a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the lucrative Sunbelt region and the top 20 U.S. markets, having strong demand drivers. The continued momentum in leisure travel demand and recovery in business transient demand — led by the healthy demand from small and medium-sized businesses — have aided the company’s comparable hotel revenue per available (RevPAR) growth thus far.  In the second quarter of 2023, HST’s comparable hotel RevPAR was $255.12, climbing 2.7% from the year-ago quarter’s $219.23. The comparable average occupancy percentage in the quarter was 74.2%, up 20 basis points from the prior-year quarter.Although the lodging industry may experience a few near-term hiccups owing to the current macroeconomic headwinds and concerns surrounding the potential for an economic slowdown, given the healthy demand for HST’s properties in strategic locations, it is poised to ride the growth curve.Also, HST’s aggressive capital-recycling program that entails the non-strategic dispositions of assets and redeploying the proceeds for investments in better-yielding assets highlights its prudent capital-management practices and preserves balance sheet strength.HST is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs and had $2.5 billion of available liquidity as of Jun 30, 2023. It enjoyed Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from both Fitch and S&amp;P Global as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, it has no material maturities until April 2024. With ample financial flexibility, HST remains well-positioned to tide over any challenges and bank on growth scopes.Hence, given HST’s ability to generate decent cashflows, a lower dividend payout ratio compared with the industry and a solid financial position, we expect the latest dividend rate to be sustainable over the long run.HST currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Its shares have gained 1.3% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s fall of 2.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

84,c8b993a0-bcb7-3848-a2e6-05a83c2f8c9e,LUV,2023-09-16,Airline stocks: Three factors impacting the industry,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/airline-stocks-three-factors-impacting-222420323.html,1694816660,VIDEO,"['ALK', 'LUV', 'UAL', 'SAVE', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[A number of airlines including American (AAL), Spirit (SAVE), and Southwest (LUV) have warned about the impact of higher jet fuel costs. Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials Materials and Energy Peter McNally highlights three issues impacting the industry right now. The three issues McNally cites are the increase in international travel, costs, and capacity. Capacity has become an issue, he says, because now that suppliers are delivering planes, there are more seats, and that's putting ""downward pressure"" on fares. ""Airlines have less pricing power now than they do at any point since the recovery began,"" McNally adds.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Airline stocks hitting some turbulence with several major airlines cutting guidance in recent weeks, largely due to higher jet fuel costs. American Airlines now expects third quarter earnings of $0.20 and $0.30 per share. That's sharply lower than its previous estimate of around $0.85 to $0.95 a share.Low cost carrier Spirit now sees revenue between $1.24 billion and $1.25 billion in the third quarter. Southwest, United Airlines, and Alaska all issuing new guidance on how much they're expecting to spend on jet fuel.Joining us now, we've got Peter McNally, Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials, Materials, and Energy. Peter, great to speak with you as always here. If I may summon back into the chat, Southwest specifically here. Because I think they gave a warning that was a little bit more telling about the consumer, especially on that low end here.How much of a warning shot was that to the state of this kind of travel resurgence, that many of these CEOs had said is locked in place, is good to go. We are in a countercyclical recovery on that front?PETER MCNALLY: Well, there's a few things going on here, you know, in the industry. One, I think we've seen in particular this summer, there's been a shift to international. People have been traveling domestically for a few years now since the recovery. And that's where we think we've seen the outperformance in major airlines like United, Delta, and American on their top line, serving those customers.Story continuesBut costs as well is one more factor. And then the third thing that we haven't seen really in four years is capacity. And more planes are being put into service. Airlines have been aggressive in ordering. And finally, Boeing and Airbus are getting their supply chains together. These planes are being delivered. There's more supply of seats, and that's putting some downward pressure on fares here.And we're going into a seasonally softer period for demand. So this is going to be the state of play we think for the next few months in the industry.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Peter, you know, I'm thinking back to last year when we saw really energy prices spike in a big way on the back of the Russia-Ukraine war. Airlines did raise their prices, and yet there was this continued demand from consumers who were in the middle of what we characterize as revenge travel. Is the airlines have that same pricing power this time around, even as they see their own costs add up? Because consumers, as you point out, aren't in the same place.PETER MCNALLY: Now it's different now. The situation has eroded with these additional aircrafts that are coming into service. And yes, fares have gotten high for sure. And people do want to travel. We wouldn't argue that. And we are through at least on the leisure side in terms of passenger numbers where we were in 2019. Business still has a way to go and so does international. But airlines have less pricing power now than they do at any point since the recovery began.BRAD SMITH: You mentioned something really interesting in why customers continue to book and that it's interactional. If more of the bookings are for an interactional-- excuse me-- purpose, then does that lead to a kind of leisure malaise here, of people who are just kind of booking travel for the sake of the experience of it all?PETER MCNALLY: Well, look I mean, there's always a few things to consider here. But I think one thing that should not be underestimated in this is that airlines still don't have change fees. So it's allowing people to book and then have a lot more flexibility on when and where they go.And I think what we were seeing earlier this year was people just booking to make sure that they got a seat, you know, frankly. And, you know, now at this point, like, there are more seats available, made available by these airlines with these new aircraft. And they've paid their labor, you know, whether it's pilots, flight attendants, you know, more money to get these planes in the air. But I think that's kind of the key part of the dynamic now.AKIKO FUJITA: To what extent has the rough experience is probably putting it mildly what we've seen in the summer, airlines being canceled, the constant delays, I mean, how has that been eating into not just the experience but also this travel demand? I mean, have you seen a dent on the back of it? Maybe I'm just speaking from personal experience here.But it is-- you have to wonder how frustrating it is to have to go through repeatedly in the airlines as well as the Department of Transportation has made it very clear, there is a rough patch that's happening right now partly because of staffing, but partly because of other factors as well.PETER MCNALLY: It's been frustrating for sure. But people keep coming back. Our experts would argue this summer that the disruptions really were weather-driven. United was the big one this time. But if we roll back to last Christmas, the Southwest debacle was pretty much self-inflicted. It was an IT system that melted down. It's been something that's kind of plagued the company for years, that our experts would have been citing.Prior to that, it had been getting pilots paid it off and trained to fly these things. But lately it's been more about weather. This could change as demand continues to grow. But people come back. And look, driving isn't that cheap and flying can get you there like pretty quick. But the underlying demand is still there.BRAD SMITH: All right, Peter, we got to leave things there. Of course, we could continue to talk to you all day about this.

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) stands at a healthy 20.33. But the question remains, is HCA Healthcare's stock modestly undervalued? This article will provide an in-depth valuation analysis of HCA Healthcare, shedding light on its true worth. So, let's dive in.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HCA. Click here to check it out. HCA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HCAHCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) is a Nashville-based healthcare provider organization operating the largest collection of acute-care hospitals in the United States. As of December 2022, HCA Healthcare owned and operated 182 hospitals, 126 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, and a broad network of physician offices, urgent-care clinics, and freestanding emergency rooms across 20 states and England. With a current stock price of $255.79, HCA Healthcare's intrinsic value, as estimated by the GF Value, stands at $284.41. This discrepancy suggests that HCA Healthcare's stock may be modestly undervalued.Unveiling HCA Healthcare's True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to the GF Value, HCA Healthcare's stock appears to be modestly undervalued. At its current price of $255.79 per share, the long-term return of HCA Healthcare's stock is likely to be higher than its business growth, given its current undervaluation.Story continuesUnveiling HCA Healthcare's True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. HCA Healthcare has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02, which is worse than 94.65% of 654 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of HCA Healthcare at 4 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of HCA Healthcare is poor.Unveiling HCA Healthcare's True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthIt is less risky to invest in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. HCA Healthcare has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $61.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $20.33. Its operating margin is 15%, which ranks better than 83.98% of 649 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. Overall, the profitability of HCA Healthcare is ranked 10 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of HCA Healthcare is 11.5%, which ranks better than 57.77% of 573 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 17.6%, which ranks better than 62.79% of 524 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, HCA Healthcare's ROIC is 17.36 while its WACC came in at 10.32.Unveiling HCA Healthcare's True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideConclusionOverall, HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) stock gives every indication of being modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is poor, but its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 62.79% of 524 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.

Although the crisis is largely in the rearview mirror, remote work continues to be popular because it offers flexibility and alleviates commuting stress.But that convenience is no longer available at Wall Street juggernaut Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS).According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Goldman is urging its employees to return to the office full time, following senior managers' frustration over some staff not being present five days a week.""While there is flexibility when needed, we are simply reminding our employees of our existing policy,"" Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman's global head of human capital management, said in a statement.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.59bUS$6.00bUS$6.49bUS$7.12bUS$7.60bUS$8.00bUS$8.35bUS$8.66bUS$8.94bUS$9.21bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.69%Est @ 5.33%Est @ 4.37%Est @ 3.71%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.9% US$4.2kUS$5.0kUS$4.9kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.6kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$44bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.2b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.9%– 2.2%) = US$122bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$122b÷ ( 1 + 9.9%)10= US$48bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$92b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$60.6, the company appears about fair value at a 5.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Schlumberger as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.544. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SchlumbergerStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Energy Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +22.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.98 points to a change of +36.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 indicates a change of +25.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $32.92 billion and $36.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.2% and +12%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger.

104,82561ea0-5545-3aa3-a2f7-96c6368a662a,HOLX,2023-09-16,"Is Trending Stock Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-hologic-inc-holx-130012585.html,1694782812,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned -2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has lost 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 points to a change of -34.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $941.83 million indicates a year-over-year change of -1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.03 billion and $4.05 billion estimates indicate -17.2% and +0.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $984.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.8%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $957.13 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

Shares have added about 6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TJX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.The TJX Companies Ups Profit View on Q2 Earnings BeatTJX Companies posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the top and the bottom-line increasing year over year. Net sales and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management raised its fiscal 2024 comparable store sales, pretax profit margin and earnings per share (EPS) outlook.Quarter in DetailTJX Companies’ EPS came in at 85 cents, rising 23% from the year-ago period’s earnings of 69 cents. The bottom line cruised past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. Foreign currency movements had a 1-cent negative effect on EPS.Net sales came in at $12,758 million, up 8% from the $11,843 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,429.8 million. Foreign currency movements had a neutral effect on net sales growth.In the Marmaxx (U.S.) division, the company’s net sales came in at $7,903 million, up 9% year over year. Notably, the company witnessed strength in the apparel and accessories categories. Net sales amounted to $2,011 million, up 8% year over year, in the HomeGoods (U.S.) division.TJX Canada’s net sales came in at $1,223 million, down 2% from the figure reported in the year-ago period. TJX International’s (Europe &amp; Australia) net sales were $1,621 million, up 8% year over year.Comp store sales rose 8% at Marmaxx (U.S.) while increasing 4% at HomeGoods (U.S.). Comp store sales increased 1% and 3%, respectively, at TJX Canada andTJX International (Europe &amp; Australia). Overall, the company’s comp store sales rose 6% due to higher customer traffic, which grew in each division. We had expected a comp store sales growth of 2.7%.The pretax profit margin was 10.4%, up 1.2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter’s level. The upside can be attributed to a greater-than-anticipated gain from reduced freight costs and expense leverage. We had expected a pretax profit margin of 9.5%.The gross profit margin came in at 30.2%, up 2.6 percentage point on the back of increased merchandise margin stemming from lower freight costs. We had expected a gross profit margin of 27.3%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs as a percent of sales was 20.1%, up 1.7 percentage point. The rise in such costs can be attributed to increased incentive compensation accruals, incremental store wages and payroll costs, among others.Story continuesOther UpdatesTJX Companies ended the quarter with cash of $4,550 million, long-term debt of $2,861 million and shareholders’ equity of $6,608 million. The company generated an operating cash flow of $2,086 million in 26 weeks ended Jul 29, 2023.During the quarter, management returned $932 million to shareholders. TJX repurchased $550 million in stock, retiring 6.7 million shares. The company paid out $382 million in shareholder dividends. Management plans to repurchase shares worth $2-$2.5 billion in the fiscal year ending Feb 3, 2024.As of Jul 29, 2023, total inventories were $6.6 billion. Management is optimistic about its capabilities to offer impressive branded merchandise at its stores and online during the fall and holiday seasons.GuidanceFor fiscal 2024, TJX Companies expects an overall comparable store sales increase of 3-4%, compared with 2-3% growth projected earlier.Management expects fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.6-10.7% compared with the earlier view of 10.2-10.4%. The reported pretax profit margin is expected at 10.7-10.8% now compared with 10.3-10.5% expected earlier.For fiscal 2024, management now envisions the adjusted EPS in the $3.56-$3.62 range and a reported EPS of $3.66 to $3.72. It expected the adjusted EPS in the band of $3.39-$3.48 and the reported EPS in the range of $3.49 to $3.58.For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, management anticipates a pretax profit margin in the range of 11.3-11.5% and an EPS between 95 and 98 cents. The company is projecting overall comparable store sales growth of 3-4% for the quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, management anticipates a pretax profit margin in the range of 10.7-10.9% and an EPS between $1.10-$1.13. For the quarter, the company is projecting overall comparable store sales growth of 3-4%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, TJX has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in TJX (TJX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TJX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?TJX's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at TJX's main business drivers.Based in Framingham, MA, The TJX Companies, Inc. is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company’s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. In addition to these, The TJX Companies tries to attract consumers through rapid turn of inventories. As of Jul 29, 2023, the company operated a total of around 4,900 stores in nine countries, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia, and five e-commerce sites.The company has been able to distinguish itself from traditional retailers on the grounds of opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model. In fact, The TJX Companies’ low-cost structure sets it apart from other traditional retailers. In order to maintain control on costs, the company engages in the promotion of retail banners, rather than specific brands. The company’s distribution network is also designed in a manner such that helps curtailing costs. Moreover, the company emphasizes on creating strong relations with vendors across different countries, in order leverage buying power.  The TJX Companies operates through four business segments:In the U.S., it operates through two segments, namely, Marmaxx (through stores under the names of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods.Story continuesMarmaxx divisions (61.9% of Q2 fiscal 24 Sales) sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise.HomeGoods (15.8% of Q2 fiscal 24 Sales) chain offers home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor and decorative accessories from around the world, seasonal and other merchandise.In Canada, it operates through TJX Canada (9.6% of Q2 fiscal 24 Sales) through stores under the names of Winners, Marshalls and HomeSense and in Europe, it operates through TJX International (12.7% of Q2 fiscal 24 Sales) through stores under the names of T.K. Maxx and HomeSense.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in TJX ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $3,453.51, or a 245.35% gain, as of September 15, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 166.89% and gold's return of 38.61% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for TJX.The TJX Companies' shares have outperformed the industry in the past three months. The company’s top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Its off-price business model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and supply-chain management have been working well. The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. TJX’s Marmaxx segment is doing particularly well, where comp store sales grew in the fiscal second quarter, backed by improved customer traffic. The recovery of the HomeGoods (U.S.) division bodes well. However, TJX has been grappling with high wage and supply-chain costs. It expects these costs to be deterrents in fiscal 2024. A high debt level poses a concern for the company. Currency might also act as a deterrent.Shares have gained 6% over the past four weeks and there have been 10 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newmont should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.43. These indicators suggest that Newmont, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesIntroduction to Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM)Newmont is the world's largest gold miner, producing about 6 million attributable ounces of gold in 2022, which accounts for about 5% of global mined output. The company also produced 1.3 million attributable gold equivalent ounces from the sale of byproducts, including copper, silver, zinc, and lead in 2022. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at the end of 2022.Is Newmont (NEM) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down Newmont's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Newmont's Altman Z-score reveals that Newmont's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Newmont's historical data, 2021: 0.10; 2022: 0.08; 2023: 0.02, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Newmont's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Newmont's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.09; 2022: 0.02; 2023: 0.00) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Newmont might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.Concluding ThoughtsDespite Newmont's seemingly attractive valuation, the company's low Altman Z-score and declining financial ratios suggest that it might be a potential value trap. As always, thorough due diligence is essential before making any investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to skip our overview of the trends in the renewable energy sector, head straight to 8 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate Change.Climate change primarily results from human activities that have significantly disrupted the natural balance of our environment. With industrial growth, there was a rise in energy consumption in countries that contribute the most to climate change, leading to significant emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing the greenhouse effect.Another agonizing aspect of climate change is deforestation, as forests are carbon sinks and work as the planet’s lungs. According to the Global Forest Watch, there was a loss of 459 Mha (mega hectare) of tree cover globally between 2001-2022, equivalent to 195 GtCO₂ (gigaton) greenhouse gas emissions. This large-scale deforestation, whether for timber or to clear land for agriculture, deprives the Earth of its natural carbon filters and these harmful gases reach the ozone layer. Due to such practices, the planet's health is deteriorating, making climate change an urgent threat. The UN states that GHG emissions are anticipated to increase the planet’s temperature by 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels by 2030, which is a critical threshold for Earth. Surpassing this threshold could mean rise in sea levels, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and human societies. While countries that care about the environment the most prioritize renewable energy sources to reduce climate impact, addressing the issue thoroughly requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders.Shift Towards Renewables For A Sustainable FutureGrowing concerns about climate change, coupled with technological advancements and economies of scale, have placed renewable energy at the forefront of the energy discourse in most major carbon-emitting nations. Countries that traditionally depended on fossil fuels are now turning to renewables to mitigate environmental issues. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global investment in clean energy will amount to $1.7 trillion this year. Likewise, since EVs carbon footprint is smaller (its carbon footprint is indirect because of lithium mining and manufacturing) than conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs) as per the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the world's leading automakers plan to invest $1.2 trillion in EV development by 2030.Story continuesThe proportion of renewable energy in global power generation is consistently increasing, with nations investing in such sources to lessen their reliance on coal, oil, and gas. According to the BP Statistical Review Of World Energy, renewables accounted for almost 13% of power generation in 2021, surpassing nuclear energy (9.8%). However, despite the known environmental repercussions of coal burning, it remains a significant energy source in mega industries. The coal share in power generation increased from 35% to 36% in 2021, although this was still below its 2019 pre-pandemic level. Most of the Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy consistently offer dividends and the coal market is expected to grow to a valuation of $658.68 billion by 2027, with a CAGR of 1.4%.The cost of Solar PV has decreased dramatically, dropping more than 80% since 2010. This reduction has made solar power more accessible. For example, despite being a major carbon emitter due to its coal-based infrastructure, China tops the list of Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy. Bloomberg notes that China was responsible for over half of the $358 billion invested in solar power in the first half of 2023, leading to an installed capacity of 392 GW, roughly a third of the worldwide total.Wind power is another renewable source witnessing steady growth, with both onshore and offshore installations becoming more competitive compared to traditional power generation methods in countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, the United States has significantly increased its wind power capacity over the years, reaching 118 GW. The European Union, on the other hand, takes lead in offshore wind installations, particularly on the North Sea coasts of the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Prominent electricity companies emphasizing renewables include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL). NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has a diverse renewable energy portfolio covering onshore wind and solar power projects in the US and Canada. In 2020, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) 's electricity generation capacity was 55 GW, with over 90% originating from clean or renewable sources.NextEra Energy's Q2, 2023 earnings call highlighted that its clean energy subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources (previously known as FPL), saw a 14% year-on-year growth in adjusted earnings for the quarter due to new investments. Energy Resources has experienced strong renewable energy demand, bringing 1,800 megawatts into commercial operations since Q1 2023. Additionally, the subsidiary added 1,665 megawatts of new renewable and storage projects to the company's backlog. With NextEra Energy's backlog at 20 GW, the company is on course to double its renewable energy portfolio by 2026. NextEra Energy Resources reported a net income of approximately $1.152 billion or $0.57 per share for Q2 2023, marking an increase of $0.07 year-over-year. The company emphasized that solar power remains the most cost-effective option for its customers. This is evident from the 225 megawatts of low-cost solar integrated into the grid in Q2, 2023, raising the total solar additions to 1,200 megawatts. Having commissioned almost 1600 megawatts of new solar generation, the company aims to add about 3,100 megawatts of solar by 2025.In First Solar Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FSLR) Q2 earnings call, it was announced that the company plans to invest $1.1 billion in the construction of a new, fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in the US, which will be its fifth facility in the country. The company's recent acquisition of Evolar, a European leader in thin film perovskite and CIGS technology (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide, a semiconductor material used in thin-film solar cells), is set to fast-track its development of next-generation PV technology. By combining Evolar's expertise with First Solar Inc (NASDAQ:FSLR)'s R&amp;D and proficiency in scaling thin film PV, it aims to introduce high-efficiency tandem devices.Notably, at the end of 2022, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) had 2.2 GW of renewable power in operation, with another 4.2 GW under development. Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) 's clean energy portfolio includes onshore &amp; offshore wind farms, solar power plants, and biomass. When other stakeholders in power, transportation, and infrastructure sectors also switch to sustainable fuel alternatives, the climate damage can be significantly curtailed within the next few decades. Let's now discuss countries that contribute the most to climate change. 15 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate Change15 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate ChangeOur Methodology We ranked countries that contribute the most to climate change based on their greenhouse gas emissions from the 1990s to 2020. To find these countries, we consulted the World Research Institute's Climate Watch Database, Carbon Monitor, and Carbon Brief, focusing on emissions data from 1990 to 2020. Additional sources included the Global Forest Watch, the Climate Risk Index, and the Environmental Performance Index. We then arranged the countries in ascending order based on their greenhouse gas emissions over the past three decades.Note: The unit MtCO₂e stands for ""megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent,"" a measure of greenhouse gas emissions. Simply put, 1 megaton (Mt) = 100,000 metric tons. Based on our findings, here are the major climate change contributors:15. South KoreaGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 15305 megatons South Korea's carbon footprint largely results from emissions during vehicle production and usage, given its status as one of the world's top automobile manufacturers. Hyundai and Kia, industry giants, account for a significant portion of global vehicle sales and rank among the most profitable car companies in the world. Additionally, South Korea's reliance on coal-fired power plants worsens its greenhouse gas emissions; in 2019, coal was the source of approximately 40% of its electricity generation, becoming a primary source of its carbon emissions.14. Democratic Republic Of CongoGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 16062 megatons The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is rich in mineral resources, especially coltan and cobalt, crucial for electronics and electric vehicles. Intensive mining leads to deforestation and habitat loss, which, in turn, releases stored carbon and gives DR Congo a place among countries that produce the most carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, illegal artisanal mining, often unregulated, intensifies environmental degradation, placing the DRC among countries that contribute the most to climate change. 13. MexicoGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 17660 megatons Mexico heavily depends on fossil fuels in its energy sector, with oil and gas contributing to over 50% of its primary energy supply. This dependence places Mexico among the major greenhouse gas emitters in Latin America. Although the country possesses vast renewable energy potential, barriers in investment and policy have hampered its transition, perpetuating its considerable carbon footprint.12. IranGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 18756 megatons Iran, one of the top global oil producers, derives its influence from vast oil and natural gas reserves. Although sanctions have affected the country's exports, internal consumption for electricity and heating remains high, leading to substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, flaring, or burning off excess gas during oil extraction, emits large quantities of CO2 and methane, presenting a pressing environmental concern.11. AustraliaGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 18906 megatons Australia is among the world's leading coal exporters. Its heavy dependence on coal for both domestic electricity production and export makes it a substantial source of global greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, coal accounts for over 50% of Australia's electricity generation, overshadowing gas and oil. The nation's continued coal mining expansion, despite the global shift toward renewables, positions it among the top polluters. Additionally, intensified bushfires due to climate change release significant carbon, creating a feedback loop of environmental degradation.10. United KingdomGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 19839 megatons The United Kingdom, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, historically relied heavily on coal for its energy production. This dependence resulted in a significant accumulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although the UK has made commendable progress in reducing its GHG emissions by swiftly transitioning to renewables, the environmental impact of its historical emissions persists. By 2019, the country had substantially decreased coal's role in its energy mix, but the long-lasting consequences of its coal-centric past remain evident.9. CanadaGreenhouse Gas Emissions Between 1990-2020: 25494 megatons Given Canada's vast geography and frequently harsh climate, there is a high demand in the transportation and heating sectors, which add significantly to its GHG emissions. While Canada benefits from its abundant hydroelectric resources, it also maintains a vast oil sands industry in Alberta. Extracting from oil sands is notably energy-intensive, leading to higher carbon emissions than conventional oil drilling.Click to continue reading 8 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate Change.Suggested Articles: 25 Most Environmentally Friendly Companies in the WorldBest Climate Change Stocks To Invest In 25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare SystemDisclosure: None. 15 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate Change was originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

MA’s shares declined 0.7% on Sep 14, replicating declines in broader markets.The cobranded credit card can be easily applied digitally via the talabat app. Such card launches by Mastercard are meant to offer increased benefits and choices to its cardholders. Benefits in the form of lucrative rewards for day-to-day delivery orders can be obtained by the users of the newly launched card. The recent partnership reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to pave the way for safe and seamless digital transactions and thereby, provide an impetus to the shift to ecommerce on delivery of food and grocery items across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The support of a tech giant like Mastercard, whose digital arm is built with the help of partnerships and substantial technology investments, infuses a sense of confidence and security to MENA’s consumers, riders and restaurants in the greater adoption of digital payments.Moves similar to the latest one are means to expand the payment network of Mastercard, which is integral to its aim of providing greater choice and flexibility in transactions using multiple payment rails, such as cards, real-time payments, account-to-account transactions and crypto. Increased utilization of its card offerings may boost transaction volumes and fetch greater revenues to the tech giant.Apart from infusing greater digitization within the MENA region’s payments landscape, the card launch may strengthen the ties shared between Mastercard and Delivery Hero. The collaboration between the companies was announced in 2020 and Mastercard was entrusted with the responsibility to digitize the payment chain of Delivery Hero’s brands operating across the MENA region. Food order transactions on Delivery Hero’s apps using Mastercard-branded cards have more than doubled over the 2020-2022 period in the region.Story continuesMA’s keen eye to establish a solid footprint in the MENA region is due to its rapidly growing digital economy, spurred by increased Internet penetration and higher usage of smartphones, thereby providing a perfect ground for MA to capitalize on with its suite of affordable payment solutions.Just a day before the recent move was announced, MA partnered with Somalia's Amal Bank, one of the largest in the country in terms of branch network and customers, to launch Classic and Platinum debit cards. The tie-up is meant to promote widespread adoption of digital means across the MENA nation.Shares of Mastercard have gained 31.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 17.1% growth.  MA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are SPX Technologies, Inc.

New cars made today can have as many as 3,000 chips per vehicle, meaning a long battle between major automakers and the UAW union could eventually start to weigh on production and chip suppliers.Texas Instruments (TXN) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are among the largest auto chip manufacturers in the world, while TSMC (TSM) is the leading contract chip manufacturer. Shares of all three chipmakers moved lower on Friday.And more chipmakers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Micron (MU) could see effects over time too, as both have substantial connected car businesses. Qualcomm has doubled down on its auto business in recent years, while Micron is often discussed as the market leader when it comes to auto memory chips.The impact on these companies varies based on a few factors, including the length of the strike and each company's exposure to automakers. The UAW has opted for a ""stand up"" strike, in which workers walk out at select GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants rather than all at once, in order to prolong the action and the union's $825 million strike fund.In 2022, 52% of NXP's total revenue came from its automotive chips, according to Counterpoint Research, while Texas Instruments derived 25% of its total revenue from the industry, company reports showed. At the same time, TSMC reported that its automotive segment accounted for just 5% of its total revenue.Estimated cost of the UAW labor strike.Diversification is key when it comes to suppliers' resilience in these circumstances, Anderson Economic Group COO Tyler Theile told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday (video above). Overall, Theile said, a 10-day UAW strike could have an impact of over $5 billion in the US alone, with broader impacts globally.Story continuesThe 2019 GM strike that lasted 42 days offers clues as to what might happen.""In 2019, we saw suppliers that were 90% or more focused on supplying to GM have to shut down and completely lay off all of their workers for a number of days,"" Theile said. ""If you're a supplier that's more diversified among several OEMs, maybe you're not as impacted as quickly or as strongly.""There could be far-ranging effects on the economy broadly — but it will have to be a pretty extreme situation to get there.""In 2019, if you look at the seasonally adjusted data, the strike did push Michigan in the United States into a single-state, single-quarter recession,"" Theile said. ""So it would take a lot for this to hit, for example, multiple states or the US data and important economic indicators, like GDP, as a whole, but it's not out of the question if a quite lengthy strike is sustained.""GM workers with the UAW Local 2250 Union strike outside the General Motors Wentzville Assembly Plant on Sept. 15, 2023, in Wentzville, Mo. (Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images) (Michael B. Thomas via Getty Images)However, not all tech companies are set to be negatively affected down the supply chain amid a strike. Tesla (TSLA) is set to be a winner, especially if the strike proves lengthy.""Non-union Tesla does not face similar issues which speaks to the complexity both GM and Ford face going up against the EV leader Tesla while trying to satisfy rising union demands,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Sept. 14. ""If a strike happens (and is lengthy) then ultimately production and the EV roadmap could be pushed out into 2024 and delays would be on the horizon at this crucial period for GM, Ford, and Stellantis.""""We believe a strike lasting longer than 4 weeks would be a body blow to the EV ambitions of GM and Ford in 1H24 and delay many aspects of this initial important EV push,"" Ives added.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

127,f9cd6ae0-6bc1-3c81-af1a-0367c0f29abf,QCOM,2023-09-16,Why this analyst says Arm stock is overvalued,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-analyst-says-arm-stock-151557477.html,1694790957,VIDEO,"['2454.TW', 'ARM', 'QCOM', 'TSM', 'TSMWF', 'NVDA']","[Arm Holdings (ARM) shares jumped nearly 25% in its market debut, giving the company a valuation of about $65 billion. But for Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor, a value investor, the stock is too expensive. Windsor says when he looks at the semiconductor sector, he sees ""much better valued good companies,"" such as Qualcomm (QCOM), MediaTek (2454.TW), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and even Nvidia (NVDA). Watch the video above to find out why.Video Transcript- If the valuation is too rich, what does that mean long term for Arm? Is this level, like, where it's sustainable?RICHARD WINDSOR: Well, that's a very good question. At the moment, it's impossible to tell because, of course, the underwriters will be backstopping the share price's performance. It's not until that underwriting period is over that you would then start to see where the market really thinks the valuation of this company is.But let's say it stays around about the $60 billion where it is today. What I would expect to happen is if Arm resumes very rapid growth, as it is promising, and kick starts margins and sees rapid EPS expansion, then I think you could see that kind of valuation be supported and maybe even trickle up over a number of years. The problem is is that what if that doesn't happen? Then the investors who bought in at the IPO are taking a significant risk.- So it sounds like you're not touching this one at this point, Richard.RICHARD WINDSOR: No. You know, if I look at it from a valuation perspective, when I think about my own portfolio, I am a value-based investor. You know, that's one style of investing. And I look across the semiconductor industry and I see much better value good companies, like Qualcomm, like Mediatek, like TSMC, and even, believe it or not, NVIDIA. NVIDIA trades at a significant discount to Arm. And so from that, that's why I think the shares are too expensive, yes.- So does that mean, like, Nvidia, where it stands now, that's still a discount play in your mind?Story continuesRICHARD WINDSOR: No, and I'll just--- It's all relative, I guess.RICHARD WINDSOR: Of course. I was highlighting that from the point of view of Arm is probably now the single most expensive semiconductor company stock in the entire sector. I've also many times made the argument that while I think NVIDIA is an incredible company and has done incredible things, that the valuation of NVIDIA also remains too high. The part of the problem is, and I think Arm may suffer from this as well, it will take a little bit of time to see how the story that they sold the investors pans out.If Arm has been-- is now being valued as an artificial intelligence company like NVIDIA is and it turns out that generative AI, as I suspect, is not the beginning of the dawn of superintelligent computers, when that bubble pops, you're going to see a substantial valuation correction, and I think that is also a risk from Arm, if SoftBank has used the artificial intelligence story to sell the investors on a much higher valuation.]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $23.7 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer engineering support, logistics management, product support analysis and integration, maintenance planning, technical data, and support equipment maintenance for the P-8A aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and the governments of Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL and Whidbey Island, WA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and a solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost Boeing’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been getting ample contracts for supplying its defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.7% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT .Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. It also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a 5.6% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT’s 2023 sales implies a 1% improvement from the previous year’s reported number.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of its renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2023 sales implies a 7.7% improvement year over year.Price MovementShares of Boeing have risen 39.5% in the past year against the industry’s 7.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And matter of fact, the opposite - it probably doesn't have the - the same capacity that it had before,"" he said on Sunday during a visit to Vietnam.Beijing responded saying that ""resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese ourselves"".This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The company has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes.

Its earnings topped consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 19.5%.Toll Brothers: Based in Horsham, PA, Toll Brothers is a leading builder of luxury homes.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.PulteGroup (PHM) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PHM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 6.59, which compares to its industry's average of 8.25. Over the last 12 months, PHM's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.08 and as low as 3.66, with a median of 7.32.Finally, investors should note that PHM has a P/CF ratio of 6.05. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PHM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.69. Within the past 12 months, PHM's P/CF has been as high as 6.77 and as low as 3.45, with a median of 4.76.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that PulteGroup is likely undervalued currently.

137,3113371a-8a2f-3879-9498-0c6987285c3a,PHM,2023-09-16,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pultegroup-inc-130011573.html,1694782811,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned -0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has lost 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +0.8% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.49 billion and $17.36 billion estimates indicate +1.6% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels and Llama 2, is likely to aid prospects.However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes.

The company's performance is driven by its robust omnichannel operations aimed at improving the overall shopping experience. Walmart strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has been especially rewarding.This is evident from the constant increase in the market share for groceries, which boosted U.S. comparable sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. During the quarter, the top and bottom lines grew year over year, encouraging management to raise its guidance for fiscal 2024. Strong comp sales growth globally and e-commerce growth across all units were upsides.While the gross margin increased year over year, it was partly hurt by an adverse category mix, which is likely to linger in the third quarter. Management also expects variable pay expenses to increase year over year in the third quarter.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +7.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +19.5%. The company’s pharma unit is performing at above-market levels.Growth in 2023 is expected to be driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake from new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.

The company projects a 500,000+ FDM unit volume increase in 2023, thereby boosting sales.Decent Consumer Loan Demand to Aid Credit Acceptance (CACC)Per the Zacks analyst, increase in finance charges, driven by decent growth in consumer loans will likely aid Credit Acceptance's top line.

140,ec12afc8-1b28-3356-b1f4-a44d603b23af,JNJ,2023-09-16,This J&J exec sold Tylenol and Listerine. Now she runs its $27 billion medtech business,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-j-exec-sold-tylenol-131659901.html,1694783819,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Former Alibaba Group adviser Wei Zhang will join the Starbucks board, Iranian women are still fighting for their rights, and a J&amp;J exec pivoted from Tylenol and Listerine to medtech. Have a restful weekend. - Powerful pivot. Ashley McEvoy has worked for Johnson &amp; Johnson for 27 years. In the grand scheme of J&amp;J's 135-year existence, that's not that long. But for an executive, an almost three-decade commitment to the same company says something.McEvoy spent the first half of her J&amp;J career in consumer health, overseeing products and brands like Tylenol, Zyrtec, and Listerine. Eventually, though, she felt like she'd learned everything she could about over-the-counter products. ""I was bored,"" she says.When J&amp;J bought Pfizer's consumer health business for $16.6 billion in 2006, its largest-ever purchase at the time, she was the only J&amp;Jer to get promoted into the new business alongside several execs from Pfizer. That experience was formative. ""It teaches you to listen to your inner voice to stand up to people who maybe don't have the same perspective of the future of the business,"" she says.Ashley McEvoy, Johnson &amp; Johnson chair of medtechSo when her next major opportunity came along, with even more of a learning curve, she felt prepared. In 2009, she became president of Ethicon, J&amp;J's medical device business. Today, McEvoy is EVP and worldwide chairman for medtech, a $27 billion business with 60,000 staffers, about half of J&amp;J's employee base. J&amp;J medtech equipment is used in operating rooms for 75 million procedures each year, including for robotics and digital surgeries. ""I had to go and learn the science,"" she says.Pulling off that kind of pivot—and earning the respect of doctors and longtime medtech experts after coming in from the consumer side—required a great degree of humility, McEvoy says. Her degree wasn't even in health; she had been a communications and business major. ""Surgeons are amazing—they just want to teach,"" she says.Story continuesWhile it was an intimidating to make that kind of transition, McEvoy advises other people to take the leap when presented with similar opportunities. ""I'm so grateful I said yes, because I didn't grow up carrying a bag. I don't have letters after my name with all these PhDs and MDs. I really had to learn from our people,"" she says.Five years into her worldwide chairman role, McEvoy has taken the business from 1.5% growth to 8% growth. ""I've tended to go to areas that are not working well, breathing new life into businesses that might be older businesses and have lost their way a little bit and need to be reoriented,"" she says. So is she feeling antsy again? McEvoy says she would ""absolutely"" be interested in a CEO job.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

141,a91511e7-1b0a-329e-9fc6-1deaab00ad81,MRK,2023-09-16,Merck Receives Positive EU CHMP Opinion for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) as Adjuvant Treatment for Adults with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer at High Risk of Recurrence Following Complete Resection and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-receives-positive-eu-chmp-131000371.html,1694783400,STORY,['MRK'],"[Opinion granted based on positive disease-free survival results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-091 trialRAHWAY, N.J., September 15, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, for the adjuvant treatment of adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who are at high risk of recurrence following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy.The recommendation is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-091 trial, in which KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with NSCLC who are at high risk of recurrence (stage IB [T2a ≥4 centimeters], II or IIIA), and clinically meaningful results in the patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union, and a final decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.""While KEYTRUDA is foundational in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, there continues to be an unmet need to help more patients with lung cancer in earlier stages of disease,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""The CHMP’s positive recommendation brings us one step closer to providing a new adjuvant treatment option for patients in the European Union with earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression.""The KEYNOTE-091 trial, also known as EORTC-1416-LCG/ETOP-8-15 – PEARLS, was conducted in collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the European Thoracic Oncology Platform (ETOP).In January 2023, KEYTRUDA was approved, as a single agent, for adjuvant treatment following surgical resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 centimeters), II, or IIIA NSCLC in the U.S.Story continuesAbout lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In recent decades, the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer increased from 11% to 15% on average across EU countries. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

ERJ recently secured an order from Air Peace, a Nigeria-based airline company, for delivering five of its E175 jets valued at $288.3 million. This should boost Embraer’s revenues, starting from 2024, when the deliveries of these jets will commence.With Air Peace, the largest airline in West Africa, upgrading its fleet from the existing 50-seater ERJ145 to 88-seater E175, Embraer may witness more aircraft orders from the airline, like the latest one. This should significantly boost ERJ’s order book and thereby revenues.Growth Prospects of EmbraerSteady growth observed in air passenger traffic over the past few months, wearing down the impacts of the pandemic, has once again bolstered the prospects of the commercial aerospace industry. Also, the ease of traveling restrictions in China has lately added to the recovery of the industry.Per a report released by the International Air Transport Association in July 2023, the recovery of global passenger traffic measured by Revenue Passenger Kilometers (“RPK”) has been strong, reaching 95.6% of the 2019 level.Amid this backdrop, commercial aircraft makers like Embraer continue to witness strong demand for jets worldwide, particularly ERJ’s E-jets. Impressively, in the second quarter, the company delivered 47 E-jets, an increase of 47% compared to the second quarter last year.Considering the favorable trends in the commercial aerospace industry to prevail in the coming days, the outlook for this industry remains bright. Total global RPKs are expected to increase by 20% in 2023.Such solid opportunities prevalent in the air travel business should boost the growth of Embraer’s commercial aviation business, thus boosting its overall revenue generation prospects.Peers to GainApart from Embraer, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that may gain from the flourishing demand for aircraft are as follows:Airbus EADSY: It delivered 189 commercial aircraft in the second quarter, thus registering growth of 21.9% year over year.EADSY expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2023.Story continuesThe long-term earnings growth of Airbus stands at 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales calls for a growth rate of 17.8%.Boeing BA: It remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries.

""What was really unusual with this tripledemic was that the RSV and flu season came about a month or two months earlier than when we typically see it. And the fact that they coincided created a very big burden on our health care system.""One challenge during this tripledemic was accurately diagnosing a person with flu-like symptoms. Viral respiratory infections are especially easy to misdiagnose, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the problem. If an older adult with RSV is instead treated for influenza by mistake, this can delay appropriate care and risk their condition worsening, leading to unnecessary antibiotic use or inappropriately targeted antivirals, an extended hospital stay, and increased risk of spreading the infection to other vulnerable members of their family and community.In May 2023, GSK and Pfizer released the first two FDA-approved RSV vaccines for adults 60 years and older. In August 2023, the FDA approved a Pfizer vaccine for pregnant people to protect infants at highest risk of mortality from RSV. ""The vaccines are a big game-changer,"" says Lim, an associate professor with the ASU School of Life Sciences. ""This is a big deal. We've never ever had vaccines for RSV.""The Lim Lab is located on the ASU Tempe campus. The moderate-sized, CLIA-certified lab is equipped with two Illumina NextSeq 2000 instruments and employs genomics to study human viruses. It also sequences clinically relevant specimens from major hospitals in Maricopa County, where a majority of the state's population resides, and reports results to the Arizona public health department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These entities currently collect data on RSV-associated hospitalizations through the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance Program. Lim wants to raise community awareness about the RSV vaccine and emphasizes the important role of genomic surveillance-to make sure the vaccines are maintaining protection over time.Story continuesLim and his team conducted a sequencing study of 100 RSV-A specimens and 27 RSV-B specimens from cases at Arizona hospitals during the height of the tripledemic, between November 2022 and April 2023.Using the Illumina Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel (RVOP v2) hybrid capture, they achieved 100% genome coverage to a viral load of Ct &lt; 33. ""That's the surprising thing,"" Lim says. ""Normally, it's hard to get full genome coverage, particularly when a sample has a very low viral load. So, it's very promising having this product's increased sensitivity when you're trying to get as much information from the virus as you can from every person that's infected.""The study team sequenced the samples to determine which subtypes of RSV were present and gain clues into how they were evolving and spreading. Next, they mapped those sequences onto the parts of the viral genome that would be targeted by the vaccine to see if there were mutations that could escape and cause problems. Specifically, they examined the parts of the viral genome that are predicted to be involved in exposure of surface proteins that interact with antibodies.Discovering mutationsThe RSV vaccines target the F protein antigenic sites of the virus. Lim explains: ""For us, the best case would be that we didn't find any mutations in the F protein, which means our vaccines are fine and should probably work. Unfortunately, in this case, we started seeing mutations already existing in these viruses in our communities."" He and his team found seven different mutations in RSV-A and five in RSV-B. It's unclear whether those specific mutations will affect vaccine response. ""This was not what I was expecting. Maybe one mutation, two mutations-not this many. But again, mutations happen naturally. Not all of them cause a problem. But we need to make sure we're keeping up with our sequencing surveillance to catch anything and then update our vaccines accordingly.""The team's study, ""Genomic Sequencing Surveillance and Antigenic Site Mutations of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Arizona, USA,"" was published this month in Emerging Infectious Diseases.Lim says that to his knowledge, no one is routinely sequencing the RSV-positive samples circulating in the community. This is likely because no previous RSV vaccine had been available and because routine respiratory viral sequencing was uncommon before COVID-19. The availability of new vaccines changes the equation for molecular surveillance. The viruses that cause flu, COVID-19, and serious RSV disease are all prone to rapid changes in their genomes, so population-level sequencing is especially important for both the original design of new vaccines and for monitoring to make sure vaccines still ""match"" the strains that are causing the most disease.Looking ahead, Lim is interested in expanding pathogen surveillance for public health. He tells his students to think not just about the viruses but about the applications and technologies available for public health surveillance.""Everyone thinks that only doctors save lives, and I'm trying to tell them that researchers are an important part of the public health system as well. The things you do prevent outbreaks, and if you can improve a vaccine's design, you can save many more lives in the future. It is what researchers do.""Virologist Dr. Efrem Lim and researchers at ASU's Lim Lab | Photo: Andy DeLisle/Arizona State UniversityView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/784501/why-pathogen-surveillance-is-critical-during-a-tripledemic]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Mao said Washington was ""going further down the wrong and dangerous path of arming Taiwan"" despite Beijing's ""firm opposition"".""We urge the US side ... to stop selling weapons to Taiwan, to stop the US-Taiwan military collusion and to stop arming Taiwan, otherwise it will be met with resolute and forceful countermeasures of China,"" she said.The State Department announced three weeks ago that the US had approved a half-billion-dollar sale of advanced sensor systems built by Lockheed Martin for F-16 fighter jets to Taipei.Lockheed Martin - along with Raytheon Missiles and Defence - was already on a Chinese Commerce Ministry blacklist over Taiwan arms sales.Beijing later said Chinese companies were banned from doing business with the American firms and senior executives of Lockheed or RMD were not allowed to travel to or work in China.The self-governed island has become one of the greatest sources of tension between the two powers in recent years.Beijing regards Taiwan as a breakaway province to be brought under mainland control by force if necessary and opposes any official interactions between countries it has established diplomatic relations with and the island.Story continuesMost countries, including the US, do not recognise the island as an independent state, although Washington is opposed to any attempt to take it forcibly.In addition to the arms sale, the Biden administration notified the US Congress last month that it had approved the first-ever US military aid - amounting to US$80 million - to Taiwan under a programme generally reserved for assistance to sovereign, independent states.The US government is also reportedly planning to redirect millions of dollars of military financing for Egypt to Taiwan.On Friday, Mao said US arms sales to Taiwan ""seriously violate the one-China principle"" and ""severely harm China's sovereignty and security interests"".""The Chinese government's determination to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,"" she said.But last weekend US President Joe Biden said the economic slowdown in mainland China could make it less likely to consider an invasion of Taiwan.""I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite - it probably doesn't have the - the same capacity that it had before,"" he said on Sunday during a visit to Vietnam.Beijing responded saying that ""resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese ourselves"".This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Skechers has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Nike has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SKX likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NKE has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.SKX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.02, while NKE has a forward P/E of 26.19. We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 0.50. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 1.72.Another notable valuation metric for SKX is its P/B ratio of 1.75. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NKE has a P/B of 10.63.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SKX's Value grade of B and NKE's Value grade of D.Story continuesSKX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

While it is unclear whether the 3% includes attrition, the bank said that the reductions have been spread across ZION’s geographic and departmental footprints.The cuts, impacting nearly 300 of 10,000 ZION’s employees, have majorly been in roles that do not deal directly with customers or generate revenues.Similar to its peers, Zions is using these headcount reductions as a way to control expenses.Simmons stated, “I talk to our peers, and everybody's looking for ways to cut costs.”Amid the current tough economic backdrop, when labor costs are rising, most banks are using job cuts as a tool to reduce expenses and improve operating efficiency.Wells Fargo &amp; Company’s WFC chief financial officer, Mike Santomassimo, said that the company is eyeing opportunities to cut down expenses by reducing its real estate footprint and headcount.At the investor conference, Santomassimo said, “We continue to believe we’ve got a lot more to do to make the company as efficient as it should be.”Since third-quarter 2020, WFC has cut almost 40,000 jobs. Santomassimo noted, “We had too much real estate before Covid, and so we’ve been methodically working through that portfolio over the last few years.”Per a Financial Times article published a few days ago, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS has been planning another wave of job cuts that could take place as soon as next month. This is part of its yearly practice of letting go of the lowest performers.The expected move usually affects 1-5% of GS’s total staff. The company is aiming to cut jobs at the lower end of the range, primarily in its main business divisions like investment banking and trading.GS has undergone a minimum of three phases of layoffs since last September, which is part of the company's deep cost-saving drive amid the slump in deal-making.Like ZION, WFC and GS, Truist Financial TFC is making efforts to reduce expenses. The company unveiled its strategic expense-saving program, which will result in approximately $750 million of gross savings (excluding one-time severance charges) to be realized over 12 to 18 months.Driven partially by these initiatives, TFC expects its adjusted non-interest expenses in 2024 to be relatively stable or rise nearly 1%.Notably, at the conference hosted by Barclays, ZION’s management also presented updates for net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM).

The metric was 2.91% in June 2023. The improvement in NIM occurred despite the increase in total cost of deposits, which rose to 1.8% in July and 1.94% in August from 1.6% in June.These updates show that Zions will be able to maintain decent NII growth in the current quarter and beyond despite not much improvement in the operating backdrop over the last couple of months.Over the past six months, shares of ZION have gained 15.5% against the industry’s decline of 9.9%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, ZION carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

She will also pay a $100,000 fine and serve 120 hours of community service.Tolstedt, 63, pleaded guilty in March to obstructing a government probe into misconduct at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo's retail and small business lending business, which she led from 2007 to 2016.She is the only top executive to face criminal charges over revelations starting in 2016 about Wells Fargo's aggressive sales culture, where employees opened millions of accounts and sold products that customers did not want in order to meet unrealistic sales goals.Tolstedt is also the rare top executive at a major U.S. bank to have faced potential time behind bars. None went to prison as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis.Prosecutors had sought a one-year prison term for Tolstedt, but the judge said it would unfairly make Tolstedt appear solely responsible for Wells Fargo's misconduct.The actual sentence mirrored Tolstedt's request, and she accepted ""full responsibility"" for her crime.A lawyer for Tolstedt declined to comment. The office of U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada in Los Angeles had no immediate comment.Wells Fargo paid $3 billion in 2020 to settle federal criminal and civil probes into its sales practices, admitting it pressured employees over 15 years to sell more products, known as cross-selling.The scandal also toppled former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who in 2020 paid a $17.5 million civil fine and accepted a lifetime industry ban, and led the Federal Reserve in 2018 to cap Wells Fargo's assets, limiting the bank's growth.Story continuesThat cap remains in place, though Wells Fargo remains the fourth-largest U.S. bank.Once called the ""best banker in America"" by Stumpf, Tolstedt also accepted an industry ban and agreed to pay $20 million in civil fines to resolve charges by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Wells Fargo has also clawed back tens of millions of dollars of her pay.

During the quarter, the top and bottom lines grew year over year, encouraging management to raise its guidance for fiscal 2024. Strong comp sales growth globally and e-commerce growth across all units were upsides.While the gross margin increased year over year, it was partly hurt by an adverse category mix, which is likely to linger in the third quarter.

Novo Nordisk’s NVO board of directors approved the previously announced two-for-one split of its shares and American Depositary Receipts (ADR). AbbVie’s ABBV Skyrizi met both primary endpoints in a head-to-head study in Crohn’s disease. AstraZeneca’s AZN Fasenra met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study evaluating it for a new indication, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Authorizes Pfizer, Moderna’s Updated COVID Jabs: The FDA authorized updated mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to provide protection from the currently circulating strains of the COVID-19 virus. Pre-clinical/clinical data from studies on Moderna and Pfizer’s updated mRNA vaccines have shown improved neutralizing antibody responses against multiple circulating Omicron-related sublineages, including XBB.1.5, BA.2.86 (also called Pirola) and EG.5.1 (also called Eris). Moderna and Pfizer’s updated mRNA vaccines are each approved for individuals 12 years of age and older and are authorized under emergency use for individuals 6 months through 11 years of age.The CDC has also recommended for everyone 6 months and older to take the updated COVID shot. Pfizer and Moderna expect the vaccines to be launched in pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics across the United States this week. Americans who have health insurance will get this COVID-19 vaccine for free as most plans will cover the new vaccine.Novo Nordisk Conducts 2:1 Stock Split: Novo Nordisk announced that its board of directors approved a two-for-one split of its shares (listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen) and ADRs (listed on NYSE). The stock split of Novo Nordisk B shares is effective from Sep 13, while that of ADRs will be effective on Sep 20. Therefore, the trading unit of the Novo Nordisk B shares listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen changed from DKK 0.20 to DKK 0.10. The ADRs will similarly be split. The stock split, announced in August along with the second quarter results, has been driven by the company’s success of obesity and diabetes drugs.Story continuesAstraZeneca’s EGPA Study on Fasenra Meets Goal: AstraZeneca’s asthma drug Fasenra met the primary endpoint in the phase III MANDARA study, evaluating it for treating EGPA. EGPA is a rare autoimmune disease that can cause damage to multiple organs and tissues. The MANDARA head-to-head study demonstrated non-inferior rates of remission of a single monthly injection of Fasenra to three injections per month of GSK’s Nucala (mepolizumab), which is the only current approved drug for EGPA. Fasenra is approved for treating severe eosinophilic asthma. Several label expansion studies are ongoing for Fasenra for eosinophil-driven diseases beyond severe asthma like nasal polyps, COPD, hypereosinophilic syndrome, bullous pemphigoid and others.AbbVie’s Crohn’s Disease Head-To-Head Study on Skyrizi Meets Goals: AbbVie’s Skyrizi met both primary endpoints of non-inferiority for clinical remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI]) at week 24 and superiority of endoscopic remission at week 48 versus J&amp;J’s Stelara in a head-to-head study. The phase III study called SEQUENCE compared Skyrizi to Stelara for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have failed one or more anti-TNF therapies.

165,3b9bf732-01e0-39a8-8aca-0cd1c433c10b,PFE,2023-09-16,Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-attracting-investor-130012014.html,1694782812,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -64.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 points to a change of -49.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 indicates a change of -2.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -33.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.47 billion and $66.28 billion estimates indicate -33.8% and -0.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -54.1%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.03%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our discussion on the blockchain industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.According to CoinMarketCap, there are over 1.8 million cryptocurrencies in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.04 trillion as of September 2023. The market cap of cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high of $2.9 trillion in November 2021. Currently, there are 670 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide where digital currencies are actively traded. Cryptocurrencies primarily rely upon blockchain technology to record transactions in a decentralized and secure manner. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most dominant cryptocurrencies in the world, accounting for over 67% of the global cryptocurrency market capitalization. Both of these cryptocurrencies heavily depend on blockchain technology, which enables consensus, security, and the decentralized distribution of these digital assets. Notably, blockchain technology's application extends beyond cryptocurrency and finds utility in various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and identity verification. Popular companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) also have exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.The Impact of Rising Interest Rates on BitcoinIn the last year, the US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates on seven occasions from 3.125% to 5.375% at midpoint. The most recent interest rate hike took place on July 27, and the Federal Reserve continues to express the possibility of further rate increases as a measure to control inflation, aiming to achieve its 2% target. The US consumer price index (CPI) for the month of July 2023 was recorded at 3.2%, and analysts anticipate the CPI to increase to 3.6% for August 2023. The CPI reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, following which the Federal Reserve accelerated the pace of interest rate hikes. It is widely believed that rising interest rates are likely to hurt Bitcoin prices. However, recent market dynamics have contradicted this viewpoint. In the last year, despite the significant interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks globally, the price of Bitcoin has observed a surge of 18.5%. Bitcoin emerged as one of the best-performing asset classes as it outperformed the 12.2% increase observed by the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period. Furthermore, Bitcoin even outperformed gold prices, which are traditionally considered a safe-haven asset during periods of rising inflation. Gold experienced a more modest increase of 15.5%.Story continuesEvolving Crypto Investment LandscapeFollowing the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:BITO) in October 2021, numerous Blockchain and Bitcoin funds have entered the market. Global X, a New York-based ETF provider, has been particularly active in this space, introducing three ETFs related to blockchain, with the Global X Blockchain ETF (NASDAQ:BKCH) being one of its most recognized products. Numerous retail investors have expressed interest in identifying the best crypto ETF offered by Vanguard, a prominent investment advisor based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with an asset under management (AUM) of $7.7 trillion. While Vanguard does not offer a dedicated ETF exclusively focused on Blockchain and Bitcoin, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) serves as one of the largest and most widely recognized Bitcoin investment funds, with a market value of $3.28 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is an investment trust that charges an annual fee of 2% to cover insurance, management, and storage expenses. It holds actual Bitcoins on behalf of investors. Each share represents a fractional ownership interest in the trust's Bitcoin holdings. The investment fund enables investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without having to directly hold or manage Bitcoins. It must be noted that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades over-the-counter (OTC) as an unregistered security, so it can only be purchased through brokers.

Siren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN)5-Year Price Performance: -12.5%Total Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $68.74 millionExpense Ratio: 0.68% Siren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN) invests in companies focused on blockchain, Bitcoin, and quantum computing technologies.

Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are the top four holdings of the ETF, representing 19% of the portfolio.Here's what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was the leading detractor from performance during the quarter. Total payment volume grew +12% (foreign exchange neutral) while revenues grew +10% (FX-neutral) and adjusted operating earnings grew +19%. E-commerce industry sales trends have normalized back to their pre-pandemic trend of growth, with high-margin branded payments keeping track with the industry. Despite this, investors were concerned PayPal’s fast growing, private label payments solutions will dilute Company returns. However, payments are a very scalable business, and we expect the Company will be able to manage both private label and branded to achieve attractive returns and double-digit growth. Although multiples in the payment industry have compressed, especially after the multi-year process of being added to the financial sector, PayPal’s businesses are substantially different enough from traditional spread-based businesses, in addition to having much more compelling growth drivers, that PayPal’s well-below market multiple should revert to its higher, historical average.”6.

These specialized modules are specific to the needs of rehabilitation facilities and aim to support the treatment of patients with physical and cognitive disabilities.Rehabilitation centers face the challenge of limited data accessibility across different care settings and care teams. By implementing the EHR system throughout the organization, it will facilitate a more accurate clinical assessment during inpatient admissions and outpatient rehabilitation visits. This enhanced system will grant access to historical care data and external medical records, ensuring a comprehensive view of patient care.Supporting regulatory requirements are also critical for rehabilitation facilities as it bolsters the customer’s reputation, minimizes potential risks and prevents audits. Federal assessments can demand an extensive amount of data, often involving hundreds of data points for a single assessment, which can be a labor-intensive process.REHAB Hospital intends to leverage Oracle Health's Physical Outpatient Rehabilitation and Physical Inpatient Rehabilitation solutions to automate and simplify the process by extracting data that has already been captured in the clinical record, summarizing it and calculating responses.Oracle Corporation Price and Consensus Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteOracle Health Adoption in Smaller Hospitals to Boost Cloud Service RevenuesOracle Health, also known as Cerner, has been successful in acquiring numerous small hospitals while experiencing a decline in market share among larger hospitals. The company has significantly increased the total number of hospitals, but the smaller hospitals, acquired by ORCL, have fewer beds and patients compared with the larger hospitals it has lost. The decrease in larger hospital clientele is primarily attributed to persistent issues with the revenue cycle.Oracle Health's success in attracting smaller hospital customers can be attributed to the perception that its CommunityWorks system offers a modern EHR solution at an affordable price point.

182,c8b993a0-bcb7-3848-a2e6-05a83c2f8c9e,UAL,2023-09-16,Airline stocks: Three factors impacting the industry,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/airline-stocks-three-factors-impacting-222420323.html,1694816660,VIDEO,['UAL'],"[A number of airlines including American (AAL), Spirit (SAVE), and Southwest (LUV) have warned about the impact of higher jet fuel costs. Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials Materials and Energy Peter McNally highlights three issues impacting the industry right now. The three issues McNally cites are the increase in international travel, costs, and capacity. Capacity has become an issue, he says, because now that suppliers are delivering planes, there are more seats, and that's putting ""downward pressure"" on fares. ""Airlines have less pricing power now than they do at any point since the recovery began,"" McNally adds.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Airline stocks hitting some turbulence with several major airlines cutting guidance in recent weeks, largely due to higher jet fuel costs. American Airlines now expects third quarter earnings of $0.20 and $0.30 per share. That's sharply lower than its previous estimate of around $0.85 to $0.95 a share.Low cost carrier Spirit now sees revenue between $1.24 billion and $1.25 billion in the third quarter. Southwest, United Airlines, and Alaska all issuing new guidance on how much they're expecting to spend on jet fuel.Joining us now, we've got Peter McNally, Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials, Materials, and Energy. Peter, great to speak with you as always here. If I may summon back into the chat, Southwest specifically here. Because I think they gave a warning that was a little bit more telling about the consumer, especially on that low end here.How much of a warning shot was that to the state of this kind of travel resurgence, that many of these CEOs had said is locked in place, is good to go. We are in a countercyclical recovery on that front?PETER MCNALLY: Well, there's a few things going on here, you know, in the industry. One, I think we've seen in particular this summer, there's been a shift to international. People have been traveling domestically for a few years now since the recovery. And that's where we think we've seen the outperformance in major airlines like United, Delta, and American on their top line, serving those customers.Story continuesBut costs as well is one more factor. And then the third thing that we haven't seen really in four years is capacity. And more planes are being put into service. Airlines have been aggressive in ordering. And finally, Boeing and Airbus are getting their supply chains together. These planes are being delivered. There's more supply of seats, and that's putting some downward pressure on fares here.And we're going into a seasonally softer period for demand. So this is going to be the state of play we think for the next few months in the industry.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Peter, you know, I'm thinking back to last year when we saw really energy prices spike in a big way on the back of the Russia-Ukraine war. Airlines did raise their prices, and yet there was this continued demand from consumers who were in the middle of what we characterize as revenge travel. Is the airlines have that same pricing power this time around, even as they see their own costs add up? Because consumers, as you point out, aren't in the same place.PETER MCNALLY: Now it's different now. The situation has eroded with these additional aircrafts that are coming into service. And yes, fares have gotten high for sure. And people do want to travel. We wouldn't argue that. And we are through at least on the leisure side in terms of passenger numbers where we were in 2019. Business still has a way to go and so does international. But airlines have less pricing power now than they do at any point since the recovery began.BRAD SMITH: You mentioned something really interesting in why customers continue to book and that it's interactional. If more of the bookings are for an interactional-- excuse me-- purpose, then does that lead to a kind of leisure malaise here, of people who are just kind of booking travel for the sake of the experience of it all?PETER MCNALLY: Well, look I mean, there's always a few things to consider here. But I think one thing that should not be underestimated in this is that airlines still don't have change fees. So it's allowing people to book and then have a lot more flexibility on when and where they go.And I think what we were seeing earlier this year was people just booking to make sure that they got a seat, you know, frankly. And, you know, now at this point, like, there are more seats available, made available by these airlines with these new aircraft. And they've paid their labor, you know, whether it's pilots, flight attendants, you know, more money to get these planes in the air. But I think that's kind of the key part of the dynamic now.AKIKO FUJITA: To what extent has the rough experience is probably putting it mildly what we've seen in the summer, airlines being canceled, the constant delays, I mean, how has that been eating into not just the experience but also this travel demand? I mean, have you seen a dent on the back of it? Maybe I'm just speaking from personal experience here.But it is-- you have to wonder how frustrating it is to have to go through repeatedly in the airlines as well as the Department of Transportation has made it very clear, there is a rough patch that's happening right now partly because of staffing, but partly because of other factors as well.PETER MCNALLY: It's been frustrating for sure. But people keep coming back. Our experts would argue this summer that the disruptions really were weather-driven. United was the big one this time. But if we roll back to last Christmas, the Southwest debacle was pretty much self-inflicted. It was an IT system that melted down. It's been something that's kind of plagued the company for years, that our experts would have been citing.Prior to that, it had been getting pilots paid it off and trained to fly these things. But lately it's been more about weather. This could change as demand continues to grow. But people come back. And look, driving isn't that cheap and flying can get you there like pretty quick. But the underlying demand is still there.BRAD SMITH: All right, Peter, we got to leave things there. Of course, we could continue to talk to you all day about this. Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials, Materials, and Energy. Peter, have a great weekend.PETER MCNALLY: You too. Take care.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.E.ON SE and Pinnacle West are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that EONGY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PNW has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.EONGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.87, while PNW has a forward P/E of 18.83. We also note that EONGY has a PEG ratio of 0.76. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PNW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.91.Another notable valuation metric for EONGY is its P/B ratio of 1.40. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PNW has a P/B of 1.47.These metrics, and several others, help EONGY earn a Value grade of A, while PNW has been given a Value grade of C.EONGY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Pinnacle West Capital is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.034 = US$758m ÷ (US$24b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Pinnacle West Capital has an ROCE of 3.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.5%. See our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital roceIn the above chart we have measured Pinnacle West Capital's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Pinnacle West Capital, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 3.4% from 5.6% five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Bottom LineWhile returns have fallen for Pinnacle West Capital in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. In light of this, the stock has only gained 21% over the last five years. Therefore we'd recommend looking further into this stock to confirm if it has the makings of a good investment.One more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with Pinnacle West Capital (at least 2 which don't sit too well with us)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.While Pinnacle West Capital isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ISRG) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-ownership-shares-intuitive-surgical-120150261.html,1694865710.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intuitive Surgical's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 23 shareholders own 51% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyIf you want to know who really controls Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuitive Surgical. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Intuitive Surgical already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intuitive Surgical's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Intuitive Surgical is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 5.4% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$514m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuitive Surgical better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.Ultimately the future is most important.

Recently, BXP broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.The 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.BXP could be on the verge of another rally after moving 5% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Once investors consider BXP's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies.

QuoteQuarter in DetailsiPower posted a loss of 10 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share and the loss of 5 cents per share reported in the year-ago period.Net sales were $23.4 million, up 6% year over year. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22 million. This increase was attributed to greater product sales to the company’s largest channel partner and strong demand for iPower’s non-hydroponic product portfolio.Gross profit of $9.1 million was flat with the year-ago quarter. Also, the gross margin contracted 250 basis points to 38.7% from the prior-year period. The decline in the gross margin mainly resulted from the increased cost of goods sold tied to inventory that had previously experienced elevated freight charges, along with normal variations in the product and channel mix.Operating expenses increased 13.2% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Also, the operating margin increased 330 basis points from the prior-year period to 51.3%. The rise in operating margin was partly due to increased expenses associated with selling, fulfillment and marketing, which were incurred in conjunction with the sale of inventory built up in the prior quarters. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Other Financial DetailsiPower ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 million. As of Jun 30, 2023, net debt was down 43% to $8.1 million from $14.2 million as of Jun 30, 2022. Total stockholders' equity was $20.9 million at the end of the quarter under review.OutlookFiscal 2023 was the third straight year when iPower registered double-digit revenue growth, owing to stellar and consistent demand for its in-house products, which constituted more than 90% of the total revenues. Additionally, iPower continued to diversify its product offerings beyond hydroponics, with non-hydroponic products making up more than 75% of sales in fiscal 2023.Throughout the past year, management focused on addressing the challenge of high-cost inventory build-up from previous periods, which had been hurting the gross margin lately. Encouragingly, the company has successfully reduced excess inventory levels and foresees a gross margin improvement in fiscal 2024. With a more streamlined and efficient supply chain, normalized inventory levels, and sustained demand for products, the company remains confident in attaining growth and profitability goals.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have railed 16.5% in the past six months against the industry's decline of 7.9%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderBelow, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.

We also reviewed Dalio's top 10 stock picks in 2023. You can skip our detailed discussion about Ray Dalio and jump directly to the Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks.After stepping down from official roles last year, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is pursuing his passions and seeking to transfer his wisdom in various ways to help others succeed. He begins each day by closely monitoring the markets and spends 6 to 8 hours per day conducting research, which he refers to as ""digging."" The legendary investor, who founded Bridgewater Associates in his two-room apartment and grew it into one of the largest investment management firms with approximately $195 billion in assets under management, also frequently appears on news channels and YouTube videos. He also remains active on active on Twitter and other social platforms to present his stance on economic, political, and other global challenges. Although he stepped down as co-chief investment officer last year and no longer participates in day-to-day matters to pursue his passions, he still has a significant influence on Bridgewater's investing decisions. He is still on the operating board and serves as the investment committee's mentor. His ability to predict future market movements due to his strong understanding of macroeconomics and global world order has helped his firm make money over the last five decades. He had predicted the 2008 financial crisis as early as 2006. As his firm was well prepared for the impending financial crisis, its flagship Pure Alpha strategy was up 8.7% after fees in 2008. Besides that event, Dalio's firm has a history of making noteworthy moves. In 2022, his firm built over $10 billion in short positions in European stocks because of the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, in 2018, his firm opened $22 billion worth of short positions in Europe and made a $14 billion bet against European stocks in 2020. Story continuesMost recently, following his visit to China in April 2023, the American billionaire published a LinkedIn post about China-US tensions. He advised the world's two largest economies to maintain good political and trade relations because he believed even the prospects of war would be a drag on markets and global economic activity. However, he also warned that both countries are on the verge of war: What I mean when I say that the US and China are on the brink of war is that it appears that they are close to having a sanctions war and/or military war that neither side wants but many believe will probably happen because a) each side is very close to the other’s red lines, b) each side is using brinksmanship to push the other at the risk of crossing each other’s red lines, and c) politics will probably cause more aggressive brinksmanship over the next 18 months. I want to emphasize that by saying that they are on the brink, I don’t mean to say that they will necessarily go over the brink. I mean to say that they are very close to crossing red lines that, if crossed, will irrevocably push them over the brink into some type of war that damages these two countries and causes damage to the world order in severe and irrevocable ways—like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did for Russia and the world, just much bigger. Dalio has also been vocal about his long-held fascination with China. He is also well-liked in China, where his investment firm operates a wealth management business, becoming the largest foreign hedge fund last year with nearly $3 billion in investments, more than doubling the previous year. Since its inception in 2018, Bridgewater's main China fund has generated an annual return of 15.6% through October 2022. In one of his LinkedIn posts, he stated that the Chinese economy needs a big debt restructuring. However, he added that debt restructuring would be easier because the majority of its debt is in its own currency: So, how do those who reduce the debt burdens do it? It primarily depends on whether the debt is in one’s own currency or a foreign currency (if it’s in one’s own currency like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage) and whether it is held by one’s own citizens or foreigners (if it’s held by one’s own citizens like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage)—though it is never easy. Given these circumstances, it also depends on how the restructuring is done. A well-done restructuring happens in a balanced way. I call that a “beautiful deleveraging.” It balances deflationary defaults/restructurings with inflationary printing of money/debt monetization to spread out the burden. The mechanics of this process are explained in the first chapter of the book linked above, so I won’t try to squeeze them in here.While Bridgewater appears to be doing well in competitive Chinese markets, the firm is continuing to reduce its exposure to Chinese stocks listed on the US stock exchange. Ray Dalio's firm sold nearly a third of its stake in Chinese stocks during the second quarter. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) and Zhihu Inc. (NYSE:ZH) are among the 13 companies that the firm has exited in the second quarter. Dalio's Bridgewater held $480 million in 31 US-listed Chinese companies at the end of the June quarter. Meanwhile, the 13F filing also revealed that Dalio used exchange-traded funds such as the iShares MSCI China ETF and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF to diversify his exposure to China.  What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days - Top 10 Stock Picks in 2023Our MethodologyAs Ray Dalio continues to mentor the investment committee and his philosophy dominates investment moves, paying attention to Bridgewater's stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Bridgewater's second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days? - Top 10 Stock Picks in 202310. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $234 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 366Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been one of Ray Dalio's favorite stock holdings over the last decade, but the firm has significantly increased its position in the tech giant during the 2022 bear market when its shares were trading at a significantly lower price. Dalio's strategy of buying on the dip worked because Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares have risen by a whopping 50% year to date. The recovery in ad revenue, combined with a focus on AI technology, has increased investor confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). During the company's second-quarter conference call, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the importance of artificial intelligence, stating that the company is working to incorporate AI into its products.In the first half investor letter, Pershing Square Holdings, an investment holding company, explained the reasons for creating a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Here is what the firm stated about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG):“Earlier this year, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. We believe that Google is one of the world’s greatest businesses with deep barriers to entry and massive network effects underpinning its core search business. After having closely followed the company for many years, we had the opportunity to acquire a stake in Google at a highly attractive valuation as misplaced concerns over its competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and its strong growth prospects.Google is the dominant leader in the fast-growing digital advertising market. Google has 85%+ market share in search and, along with YouTube, approximately 50% share of the digital advertising market. With higher and improving returns on investment, we expect digital ads to continue to take market share from traditional ad formats like TV and print, and increasingly drive the total advertising market growth above its historical trend. For example, in retail, rising e-commerce penetration is catalyzing the migration of offline promotion and trade spend dollars into digital ads. With Search and YouTube as two of the highest return and most resilient ad formats, Google is well positioned to benefit from the structural growth in digital ad share across many categories.Similarly, in its Cloud business, Google is a top three player in an oligopolistic market that is in the early stages of a multi[1]year shift of IT workloads from on-premise to cloud and hybrid cloud solutions. These powerful secular tailwinds have enabled Google to grow overall revenues at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the last five years which should continue to support near- double-digit top-line growth in the coming years…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $241 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 175Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Ray Dalio's Bridgewater's strategy of increasing its stake in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) during last year's bear market has so far rewarded his firm. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock is up more than 24% year to date. Dalio's hedge fund maintained its confidence in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by holding nearly one million shares at the end of the June quarter, up 3% from the previous quarter. The latest financial results and outlook from the company indicate that there is still room for growth. Revenue of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) increased by 7% year over year in the June quarter, while earnings per share of $2.16 topped the estimate of $2.12. The second quarter earnings were also up from $2.09 in the previous quarter and $1.98 in the same period last year.   In the second quarter investor letter, Baron Funds, an investment management company, identified Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) as a high-conviction idea in their fund. Here is what the fund stated about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated, and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo, Visa announced its intention to acquire the Brazilian company for $1 billion in late June.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $269 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 60Bridgewater's strategy of buying stocks at low prices has worked in the case of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), as it has for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Throughout late 2020 and early 2021, Ray Dalio's fund steadily increased its position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Although the firm sold some stake in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in late 2022, it again raised its position in the coffeehouse company by 10% in the June quarter to 2.72 million shares. In addition to share price appreciation, Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) healthy dividend yield of 2.20% makes it an attractive stock to hold for the long term. However, some investment management firms are pessimistic about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) performance ahead. The London Company, an investment management company, stated in its second-quarter investor letter that uncertain market conditions could negatively impact the performance of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Here is what the firm said about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX):“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $402 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 83Ray Dalio's hedge fund has been selling its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) over the last few quarters in order to capitalize on the share price gains it has generated over the last three years. The firm reduced its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from approximately 4.7 million shares in the second quarter of 2022 to approximately 2.56 million shares at the end of the June quarter of 2023. Despite this, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is Ray Dalio's seventh largest stock holding, with a total value of $402 million. The fund appears to have benefited from its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) because shares of the company have risen sharply since it established its position in Q3 2020. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), pays out healthy dividends. It is a dividend aristocrat with a 49-year dividend growth history. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was in the 81 hedge funds in the second quarter, according to data tracked by Insider Monkey. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater is among the largest hedge fund investors in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).6. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $423 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been a major stockholding of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates over the last three years. In the third quarter of 2020, the firm began building a stake in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and by early 2022, its stake had grown to 2.1 million shares. However, since then, Dalio’s firm has been lowering its stake in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to capitalize on the recent share price rally and allocate money to other opportunities. Despite this, the firm still held 1.4 million shares of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) valued at $423 million as of the end of the June quarter, making it the portfolio's sixth largest holding. Like  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is also among the best dividend payers. It has raised dividends in the past 21 consecutive years.  McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was in 68 hedge fund portfolios as of the end of the second quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is among the largest shareholders in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Click to continue reading and see Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks in 2023.     Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Reddit10 Best Silver ETFs15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDDisclosure: None.

200,09e09efb-c676-3706-bed1-95e247413c46,APH,2023-09-16,Amphenol (NYSE:APH) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.21,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-nyse-aph-due-pay-184402408.html,1694803442,STORY,['APH'],"[Amphenol Corporation's (NYSE:APH) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.21 per share on 11th of October. This means the annual payment will be 1.0% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average. See our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, prior to this announcement, Amphenol's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 14.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.105 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.84. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 23% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Amphenol has grown earnings per share at 22% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Amphenol Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

205,94206a66-a84a-3aad-9539-4846ce4d83aa,VZ,2023-09-16,Verizon executive kicks off week two of US v Google antitrust trial,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-executive-kicks-off-week-190416941.html,1694804656,STORY,"['VZ', '005930.KS', 'GOOGL']","[By Diane BartzWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department's first witness when the government kicks off the second week of the Google antitrust trial will be a Verizon executive, who will likely face questions about agreements that the search and advertising giant reached with wireless carriers to be the default on their smartphones.The trial began Tuesday with talk of the ""future of the internet"" but quickly plunged into the weeds of commercial agreements with Android makers like Motorola and Samsung.On Monday, the first witness will be Brian Higgins from Verizon who says on his LinkedIn profile that he is a ""senior vice president of device and consumer product marketing"" who focuses on Verizon's ""device, product, and accessory portfolio.""The Justice Department argues that Google agreements with mobile carriers and others worth $10 billion annually to win powerful default positions on smartphones and elsewhere so that it would dominate search to drive up its own profits.James Kolotouros, a Google executive responsible for negotiating the company's agreements with Android device makers and carriers, testified late in the week that Google pressed Android smartphone makers to have Google as the default search engine and other Google apps pre-installed on their machines.Under cross-examination from Google's John Schmidtlein, Kolotouros said that Google's goal in writing the contracts was to ensure the Android phones would compete with Apple's ""elegance"" and give users a predictable experience.The antitrust fight has major implications for Big Tech, which has spent years being scrutinized by Congress and antitrust enforcers. Companies have been accused of buying or strangling small rivals but has defended itself by emphasizing that its services are free, as in the case of Google, or inexpensive, as in the case of Amazon.com.Google argues that its search engine is wildly popular because of its quality, and payments to wireless companies or others were compensation for partners.Story continuesFUTURE OF THE INTERNETOnce the opening statements about the ""future of the internet"" were out of the way Tuesday, government lawyers spent the rest of the week wrangling over details. One big question was: Do people stick with defaults on their computers and smartphones or do they switch if they don't like the default?The government called Antonio Rangel, who teaches behavioral biology at the California Institute of Technology, to argue that people are likely to stick with defaults likes search engines or map apps if they are put on computers and mobile phones. This would show why Google would want to pay to be the default, or exclusive, to win more search queries and make higher profits advertising on them.In response, Google lawyers Schmidtlein showed data that indicated that users happily stick with Google's search engine when pre-installed on their devices but switch away from Bing or others they like less.The government also questioned a former Google executive, Chris Barton, who was at Google from 2004 to 2011. Barton said that in its revenue-sharing deals with mobile carriers and Android smartphone makers, Google pressed for its search to be the default and exclusive. If Microsoft's search engine Bing was the default on an Android phone, Barton said, then users would have a ""difficult time finding or changing to Google.""Early in the trial, antitrust celebrities like Tim Wu, a former Biden competition advisor, packed the courtroom along with officials from companies that have accused Google of seeking to squash them. By midday Friday, there were empty seats.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)]"

Henson Foundation Self-Care Wellness Pods, I knew we had to start with women, and specifically women on HBCU campuses. I can remember through my own experiences with stress and anxiety, not having the adequate support to deal with my issues or the education to name what I was experiencing,"" said BLHF Founder, Taraji P. Henson. ""Black women, from a very young age, are taught to be strong and dismiss their own suffering, tending to the needs of family and community often at the expense of their own well-being. The She Care Wellness pods seek to change this narrative,"" says BLHF Executive Director, Tracie Jade. ""Our shared vision and partnership with kate spade new york has been vital in promoting conversations and offering support to students to take care of their mental health, starting with our successful launch of She Care Wellness pods at Alabama State University. We are proud to open our second installment at Hampton University this fall,"" Henson stated.""At kate spade new york, we believe that mental health is foundational to women's empowerment, and recognize that it has long been under-acknowledged, underfunded, and stigmatized. We are committed to increasing accessibility of mental health resources to women and girls around the globe through our social impact work and trusted partners in this space,"" said kate spade new york CEO and Brand President, Liz Fraser. ""We are proud to expand our partnership with Taraji, Tracie and The Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation. By offering space and resources dedicated to mental health, together we can create a positive difference for young women on HBCU campuses and in their communities.""""The health and wellbeing of our Hampton University community is of the utmost importance,"" Hampton University President Darrell K. Williams expressed. ""We take a holistic approach to education and, as such, we are honored to partner with the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation and kate spade new york on the She Care Wellness Pods, positioning our students with additional resources for mental wellness, helping to prioritize the importance of mental health within our communities.""Hampton University is proud to be a recipient of the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation's Wellness Pods,"" said Kristie Norwood, Ph.D., director, HU Student Counseling Center. ""One out of five adults are affected by mental health diagnoses and 39% of college students experience a significant mental health issue. It is our mission, at the HU Student Counseling Center, to help normalize therapy within the Black community, and to educate our students on the importance of self-care and mental health awareness. The Wellness Pods will be part of a multi-faceted approach to ensuring the health and wellness of our students.""Each She Care Wellness Pod is designed to create an environment that stimulates joy, peace and serenity through intentional design and color selection. The mural is a reflection of each campuses' unique identity, from the perspective of the student body. One student is selected by each campus leadership team to design the mural that is painted on the outside of the containers. The intention of the mural is to reflect the diversity of women and intersecting identities within the local study body.""The piece I have created reflects the importance of watering yourself based upon what your body and mind need,"" said Hampton University student and mural artist T'Kiyah Reeves. ""As women, we must prioritize our wellness. We must treat our minds with the same love, care, compassion and grace we would give to a tangible seedling to support its growth into something beautiful.""As a member of kate spade new york's Social Impact Council, which was established in January 2022, Taraji P. Henson, has continued her work with the global lifestyle brand to increase mental health resources.

The on-campus mental health destination will officially open to Hampton University students on November 2, allowing the community to take advantage of increased mental health resources and access.About The Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation:Founded in 2018, BLHF has built its reputation on providing trusted referrals and demonstrating a deep understanding of the population health of communities of Color.

214,1bbbd47f-0e8b-3340-9615-31f3c39f8796,CHRW,2023-09-16,3 Transport-Service Stocks to Watch Despite Industry Concerns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-transport-stocks-watch-despite-134300092.html,1694785380,STORY,"['CHRW', 'MATX', '^GSPC', 'EXPD']","[The Zacks Transportation-Services  industry faces challenges, ranging from high inflation-induced elevated interest rates, weak freight rates, high costs and supply-chain disruptions.Despite the challenges, we believe that stocks like Expeditors International of Washington EXPD, C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW and Matson MATX should be on an investor’s watchlist despite the improvement in the demand scenario from the pandemic lows.About the IndustryThe companies belonging to the Zacks Transportation-Services industry offer transporters logistics, leasing and maintenance services. Some industry players focus on the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding. Third-party logistics entities provide innovative supply-chain solutions. They also focus on services like product sourcing, warehousing and freight shipping. The companies have expertise in trucking, air and ocean transportation. Additionally, some players in this industry deliver domestic and international express delivery services. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the economy's health. An uptick in manufactured and retail goods, favorable pricing and improvement in global economic conditions bode well for the industry participants.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Transportation-Services IndustrySupply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Weak Freight Rates: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Below-par freight rates are also hurting the industry’s prospects. Highlighting the weak freight demand, the Cass Freight shipments Index declined 2.2% month on month in July. This measure has deteriorated month on month in five of the seven months reported this year, confirming the overall declining trend.Strong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile through dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and business confidence. Among the Transportation - Services industry players, Matson announced a 3.2% increase in the quarterly dividend in June.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty: Most companies in the industry are experiencing rising costs in the form of increased expenses. The inflationary environment, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting capital programs. The sharp rise in oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended voluntary supply cuts has also contributed to the recent downtrend in U.S. equity markets. This may lead to a rough road for the Transport- Service providers.Focus on Cost-Cuts to Drive Bottom Line: Despite signs of cooling inflation, we are not out of the woods. In fact, with inflation still well above the Fed’s 2% target, more interest rate hikes in the near term cannot be ruled out. We note that the industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and improving productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and weaker-than-expected demand scenarios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation - Services industry is a 26-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation  sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183, which places it in the bottom 27% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for 2023 has decreased 2.7% since February-end.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Transportation-Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has inched up 0.4% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's appreciation of 14.8% and the broader sector’s uptick of 1.6%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-sales, a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 2.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.71X. The value is, however, higher than the sector's trailing 12-month P/S of 1.58X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.43X, as low as 1.55X and at the median of 1.97X.Price-to-Sales Ratio (F12M) 3 Transport Services Stocks to WatchMatson: This Honolulu, Hawaii- based provider of ocean transportation and logistics services currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are impressed by the cost-management actions taken by the company to drive its bottom line. Efforts to reward its shareholders are commendable as well.Over the past 60 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings move 26% north. The stock has gained 43.1% over the past six months.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here    Price and Consensus: MATXExpeditors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This Seattle, WA-based freight forwarder’s efforts to reward its shareholders are commendable. EXPD’s liquidity position is encouraging too.EXPD has outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other two). The stock has gained 11.2% over the past six months.Price and Consensus: EXPDC.H. Robinson Worldwide, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, operates as an asset-light logistics player. Efforts to control costs bode well for this freight broker. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock. CHRW’s liquidity position is encouraging too.In September, C.H. Robinson opened a new facility to speed up trade across the Mexico border to meet buoyant demand for border logistics facilities owing to nearshoring expansion. This has soared since 2020, boosted by declining U.S.-China trade relations and shifting global supply chains caused by the pandemic.  Price and Consensus: CHRW   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The next stop? Building fuel-agnostic engines in its VPI Lab.VPI, or value package introduction, is the Cummins' process for commercializing technology for the market through the definition, design, development and introduction of products, services and information for customers.In 2022, Cummins unveiled the company's industry-first fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain solution. The fuel-agnostic engine platform can be optimized for different low-carbon fuel types using a high degree of parts commonality to help reduce carbon emissions in commercial transportation.RMEP's VPI Lab will begin building prototype engines before they're approved to hit the main assembly line. Various projects are in progress at the plant to upgrade the current production line and create a new low-volume production line, both of which will be capable of building both current and new Cummins' products.Plant personnel made upgrades to the VPI Lab to replicate the production environment for building the prototype engines. Run by two engineers, seven technicians and supported by a large cross-functional team, the lab uses prototype parts and replicates the manufacturing process of the assembly line to build the engines. This allows the team to identify errors, issues or roadblocks, ultimately decreasing downtime when the engine eventually moves to production.Lab specialists validate the designs from a form, fit and function perspective. They make improvements as needed. It's critical to spot any needed changes during the VPI phase, as it's far more difficult to change the design and order of operations on the assembly line after the new engine goes into production.Story continues""There's a lot of work that goes into preparing our RMEP to manufacture a new product here,"" said Chief Engineer Crystal Gwynn. ""The VPI team works hard to identify any issues and get them resolved before full production manufacturing begins.""Building the prototype engines at the same site where they're manufactured opens up opportunities for collaboration between teams at the plant. Employees in the lab can train colleagues on new products and gain input to make each engine better.""We want to build it first,"" Howell says. ""Since the engine will be manufactured here as well, we want to build it first, too. We know what we're looking for, and we know how the engine is assembled. We want to refine that inside the plant.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/784523/cummins-plant-begins-building-prototype-of-fuel-agnostic-engines-to-prepare-for-production]"

This offer comes as Disney is also reportedly in preliminary talks with Nexstar Media Group (NXST) over a potential deal for these stations.Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the Live show to break down Disney CEO Bob Iger's plans for the company's broadcast segment while prioritizing growth in its streaming offerings.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Disney may be getting a big offer for ABC. Byron Allen has reportedly put up a $10 billion bid for the network along with the FX and National Geographic, according to Bloomberg. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us with the details. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Brad. Yeah, so a $10 billion bid from Allen, reportedly. On top of that, you have Nexstar Media Group being another reported potential buyer for these linear networks. Now, it's important to note that these are exploratory talks, so nothing has been set in stone just yet.Disney did respond to the reports writing in a statement, quote, ""While we are open to considering a variety of strategic options for our linear businesses-- at this time the Walt Disney Company has made no decision with respect to the divestiture of ABC or any other property and any report to that effect is unfounded.""But overall, this does represent how serious Bob Iger is about potentially selling off the linear networks. He's said before that linear may no longer be core to Disney's business moving forward. We also heard from Nexstar earlier this week at a media conference.The company did express its interest to potentially purchase some of those assets from Disney. Although they did say that any deal moving forward will be complicated, especially if ESPN is not included in that spin off, since ESPN and ABC both share some of those telecasts.Story continuesAnd then on top of that, at the end of the day, linear is still a profitable, high-margin business. It does fund a lot of the growth initiatives that Disney has been tackling like streaming so there's that tricky balance between appreciating the cash flow that linear provides while also understanding that we're in a big secular decline right now as more Americans cut the cord in favor of those less profitable streaming services.So overall, yet another example of just the complexities within the linear bundle. And it comes on the heels of that charter agreement that they met earlier this week. So a lot going on at Disney right now.KIKO FUJITA: So, Allie, what is Disney's future on broadcast TV?ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's the big question. And there's a lot of unknowns right now. CEO Bob Iger said during the latest earnings call that the company is going to focus on three main growth areas-- that's the film business, the parks business, and the streaming business. So linear networks nowhere near included in that.And yes, we have these early stage talks reportedly with Byron Allen and Nexstar Media. However, analysts have long questioned who will be the buyer of these businesses, especially amid those cord-cutting declines that I've been talking about. And this is something that legacy media in addition to Disney is facing overall-- Comcast NBC, Paramount CBS, Fox Corporation.According to a recent data from Nielsen, linear TV viewership fell below 50% in July for the very first time while time spent streaming via television continued to increase. And then you have those advertising woes that just keep mounting for these various companies.And then interestingly enough, I took a look at the market cap of Netflix, which is currently hovering right above $175 billion. That roughly equals the market caps of Disney, Fox, and Paramount combined. So investors seem to be putting their weight behind streaming services right now.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely. Allie, thanks for tracking this, breaking this down for us. We'll see if a deal gets finalized.ALEXANDRA CANAL: We'll see.]"

Participating suppliers will also have the opportunity to match with an experienced mentor for additional peer-to-peer support.""ComEd recognizes that when we invest in diverse-owned suppliers, it strengthens families, uplifts communities and creates local jobs now and into the future,"" said Erica Borggren, vice president of customer solutions at ComEd. ""By providing support to diverse suppliers – many of whom are small or family-run businesses – we can help them compete with larger organizations in the growing market that offers families and businesses the opportunity to save money and energy.""ComEd created the EESP Incubator Program in 2019 to focus on recruiting diverse suppliers and support the development of all interested contractors. After graduation, suppliers are eligible to join the ComEd EESP network, which consists of contractors, distributors, engineering and design firms trained on the processes and procedures of the ComEd Energy Efficiency Program. Once accepted, these contractors are approved to provide ComEd Energy Efficiency Program incentives to customers and grow their businesses through the successful completion of energy efficiency projects.Story continuesA graduate’s storyTo address the barriers often faced by diverse contractor businesses, ComEd saw an opportunity to develop programs to support these local businesses, especially businesses whose employees are trained as lighting, HVAC or general contractors.Geri Harston is a 2023 Incubator program graduate and project coordinator at Chicago’s Taylor Electric Co., black family-owned, female-led electrical contractor that has served families and businesses across the Chicago area since 1922.At Taylor, Harston was recently tasked with expanding and improving the company’s service and maintenance department to include energy efficiency installations. To ensure the effective and efficient expansion of the service and maintenance department, Harston turned to the ComEd EESP Incubator program.""One concept is that Taylor Electric is not alone in addressing is the need for increased demand to retrofit energy efficient systems. Being able to communicate with other like-minded companies reduces the effects of operating in a vacuum,"" Harston said. ""We feel the incentives provided by ComEd will drive more business to Taylor Electric and improve and expand our community-based projects. The support system that the EESP program has in place for us creates a roadmap to successful energy efficient installations for Taylor Electric and the communities we serve.""Harston is one of 27 contractors expected to graduate this year’s incubator program. The new graduates will join 99 alumni from previous cohorts, of which 71 are part of ComEd’s EESP network. Many graduates will implement energy-efficiency projects located in communities of need which aligns with ComEd’s vision for a clean energy future for all communities it serves, but especially for those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.Over the years, ComEd’s award-winning energy efficiency program has helped customers of all kinds reduce their energy bills and consumption, which also helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Since its inception in 2008, the ComEd Energy Efficiency Program has provided impactful contributions toward Illinois’ clean energy future. Specifically, the ComEd Energy Efficiency Program has:saved ComEd customers a total of 76 million megawatt hours of energy usage and $8 billion on their electric bills, andhelped reduce from the air carbon dioxide emissions by more than 65 billion pounds, the equivalent of taking 6.3 million cars off the road for one year.For more information, visit ComEd.com/WaysToSave.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$1.6b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 28% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about M&amp;T Bank. Check out our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About M&amp;T Bank?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that M&amp;T Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see M&amp;T Bank's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in M&amp;T Bank. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of M&amp;T BankWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that M&amp;T Bank Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$111m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - M&amp;T Bank has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

The transaction has an effective date of Mar 31, 2023.The decision to monetize the non-core assets is justified as this deal brings forward the value of a small, non-core portion of Murphy Oil’s onshore Canadian portfolio and the company has had no intention of investing in these locations for many years.Murphy Oil intends to utilize the proceeds from non-core asset divestitures in its new business in Côte d’Ivoire and development in Vietnam.During the second quarter, Murphy signed production-sharing contracts to secure working interests as the operator in five deepwater blocks in the Tano Basin offshore Côte d’Ivoire. These blocks offer tremendous opportunities for exploration and geophysical studies in this area will allow Murphy to have a better knowledge of the reserves in this region.Last week, Murphy Oil received approval from the Vietnam government to advance a field development plan at the Lac Da Vang oilfield in the southern region.Therefore, channeling the asset sales proceeds in these two prospects will likely yield positive returns for Murphy Oil.Mergers &amp; Acquisition In Oil and Energy SpaceOil and Gas companies are divesting non-core assets and making strategic acquisitions to further expand operations and benefit from core operations.Oil and Gas company Devon Energy DVN completed its all-stock merger with WPX Energy. This deal will strengthen both its positions in the Delaware and Williston Basins.Devon Energy also completed the acquisition of RimRock Oil and Gas LP in the Williston Basin in 2022. This acquisition added more than 100 highly economically undrilled locations, positioning Devon’s Williston assets to maintain high-margin production and strong free cash flow for years to come.TotalEnergies TTE continues to make strategic acquisitions and agreements with existing operators in high-potential areas and divest assets that are not in sync with its long-term objectives. In the first half of 2023, the company sold assets worth $431 million, the majority of which was a 50% interest in the Marketing &amp; Services subsidiary in Egypt. TotalEnergies’ acquired assets were worth $3,738 million in the first half of 2023.Story continuesPrice PerformanceMurphy Oil’s shares have gained 31.9% in the past six months compared with its industry’s growth of 25%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStock to ConsiderMurphy Oil currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In fact, by the time the big banks come out with their quarterly reports on October 13th, we will have seen such fiscal August-quarter results from almost two dozen S&amp;P 500 members.Beyond these early earnings reports, the overall earnings picture has unfolded much more positively and favorably than many thought possible just a few quarters back. The most significant contributing factor to this positive earnings surprise has been the resilience of the U.S. economy despite the Fed’s extraordinary tightening cycle.While a segment of the market is still of the ‘recession-is-coming’ view, the market as a whole appears to have taken its collective cue from the continuous run of steady and reassuring economic readings, coming around to the soft-landing view of the ground reality.Regular readers of our earnings commentary are aware of the stabilization in the aggregate earnings estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, which followed the roughly year-long negative revisions trend.Since early April 2023, earnings estimates for full-year 2023 have declined by -0.34% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole, with declining estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, particularly the Energy sector, offsetting notable gains in other sectors.Estimates for the Energy sector have been consistently under pressure, with the aggregate 2023 earnings estimates for the sector getting cut by -11.1% since the start of April 2023.Excluding this negative Energy sector revisions trend, aggregate earnings estimates for the remaining 15 Zacks sectors would have risen by +0.7% in that time period.Story continuesSectors enjoying positive estimate revisions in this period include Tech, Construction, Autos, Consumer Discretionary, Industrial Products, Retail, and Consumer Discretionary.We are seeing a similar revisions trend at play concerning estimates for 2023 Q3, whose advanced results include the aforementioned quarterly releases from Oracle, Lennar, and Adobe Systems.The current expectation is for S&amp;P 500 earnings to decline by -1.7% in Q3 from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -7.1% decline on +1.1% higher revenues in 2023 Q2.The chart below highlights the year-over-year Q3 earnings and revenue growth in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q3 is expected to be the last period of declining earnings for the index, with positive growth resuming from 2023 Q4 onwards. In fact, had it not been for the Energy sector drag, earnings growth in 2023 Q3 would already be positive.You can see this in the chart below, which illustrates the index’s year-over-year earnings growth on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the year-over-year change in net margins, with Q3 currently expected to be the 7th consecutive quarter of declining margins.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExcluding the Energy sector, however, net margins would be modestly up from the year-earlier period.One sector that has made significant progress on the margins front is the Tech sector, whose year-over-year comparison turned positive in the preceding period and is expected to expand further this quarter, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLook at current expectations for next year and the year after to get a sense of the disconnect between the reality of current bottom-up aggregate earnings estimates and the seemingly never-ending worries about an impending economic downturn. That said, most economic analysts have been steadily lowering their recessionary odds in recent months.This Week’s Notable Earnings ReleasesThis week, we have a relatively light reporting docket, with a little over a dozen companies on deck to report quarterly results, including 5 S&amp;P 500 members. These index members are AutoZone, General Mills, FedEx, Darden, and FactSet.FedEx shares have been standout performers this year, up +57.4% and handily outperforming UPS (down -9.4%) and the S&amp;P 500 index (up +16.6%). Estimates for this quarter and next have ticked higher lately, likely suggesting that the wind may finally be at the company’s back. FedEx will report quarterly results after the market’s close on Wednesday, September 20th.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking Ahead to Q3 Earnings  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These specialized modules are specific to the needs of rehabilitation facilities and aim to support the treatment of patients with physical and cognitive disabilities.Rehabilitation centers face the challenge of limited data accessibility across different care settings and care teams. By implementing the EHR system throughout the organization, it will facilitate a more accurate clinical assessment during inpatient admissions and outpatient rehabilitation visits. This enhanced system will grant access to historical care data and external medical records, ensuring a comprehensive view of patient care.Supporting regulatory requirements are also critical for rehabilitation facilities as it bolsters the customer’s reputation, minimizes potential risks and prevents audits. Federal assessments can demand an extensive amount of data, often involving hundreds of data points for a single assessment, which can be a labor-intensive process.REHAB Hospital intends to leverage Oracle Health's Physical Outpatient Rehabilitation and Physical Inpatient Rehabilitation solutions to automate and simplify the process by extracting data that has already been captured in the clinical record, summarizing it and calculating responses.Oracle Corporation Price and Consensus Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteOracle Health Adoption in Smaller Hospitals to Boost Cloud Service RevenuesOracle Health, also known as Cerner, has been successful in acquiring numerous small hospitals while experiencing a decline in market share among larger hospitals. The company has significantly increased the total number of hospitals, but the smaller hospitals, acquired by ORCL, have fewer beds and patients compared with the larger hospitals it has lost. The decrease in larger hospital clientele is primarily attributed to persistent issues with the revenue cycle.Oracle Health's success in attracting smaller hospital customers can be attributed to the perception that its CommunityWorks system offers a modern EHR solution at an affordable price point. This is expected to boost the company’s cloud service and license revenues in the upcoming quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2024 cloud services and licence revenues is pegged at $44.65 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.48%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at a profit of $5.51 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.62%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 39.1% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s rise of 38.1% due to the giants in the healthcare cloud computing market, such as Microsoft MSFT, International Business Machines IBM and Amazon AMZN Web Services.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.MSFT utilizes its cloud technology, Microsoft Cloud for healthcare, to integrate features from Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Power Platform and Microsoft 365.IBM offers healthcare clients a secure, open and enterprise-level environment that accommodates various workload needs and the stages of cloud adoption.

Moreover, PSA’s technological advancements and healthy balance sheet are commendable. Its sustainable dividend payouts make it an attractive investment option. However, a development boom, a rise in move-out rates and elevated interest rates are major concerns.Public Storage is one of the top owners and operators of storage facilities. The brand stands out as one of the most recognized and established names in the self-storage industry. With a significant market presence in major metropolitan centers, the company is poised to capitalize on the economies of scale, apart from benefiting from its brand recognition. The company is also in a good spot to benefit from its 35% stake in Shurgard Self Storage SA.The self-storage asset category is need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Demand for self-storage spaces has shot up amid remote and hybrid work modes, elevated home sales, and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets. Amid these tailwinds, we estimate total revenues to increase 7.3% year over year in 2023.In addition, Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In September 2023, it acquired Simply Self Storage from Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (”BREIT”) for $2.2 billion. From the beginning of 2021 through Jun 30, 2023, the company acquired 322 facilities, with 28 million net rentable square feet, for $6 billion. Following Jun 30, 2023, the company acquired or was under contract to buy 11 self-storage facilities spanning 0.8 million net rentable square feet of space across six states for $118.2 million.Management expects $2.6 billion in acquisitions and $375 million in development openings in 2023. It also has a pipeline of more than $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next two years.Story continuesPublic Storage maintains a strong financial profile characterized by solid credit metrics, including low leverage relative to its total capitalization and operating cash flows. Its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market. Moreover, Public Storage projects current cash flow growth of 96.40%, which is significantly higher than the industry’s 8.17%. With a strong balance sheet position, PSA is well positioned to take advantage of future growth prospects.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Public Storage remains committed to that. PSA has consistently paid dividends and continued with its payments even during the pandemic.In February 2023, it announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend from $2 per share to $3. Backed by robust operating fundamentals and industry tailwinds, we anticipate core funds from operations (FFO) to improve 5.1%, 4.1% and 6.5% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Looking at the company’s core FFO growth projections, financial position and a lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry’s average, its current dividend is expected to be sustainable.However, Public Storage is operating in a highly competitive environment in the United States, with a number of private, regional and local operators. This is expected to increase competition for PSA, impacting occupancies, limiting its ability to increase rents and triggering further discounting.With the abatement of the pandemic's impact, tenants are returning to their normal move-out patterns, leading to a rise in the number of people vacating Public Storage’s properties. This is likely to limit rental rate growth in many markets. For the rest of 2023, management expects to see a slight seasonal decline in occupancy levels. We estimate weighted average square foot occupancy to be 93.1% for 2023.Public Storage is affected by a high interest rate environment. The higher the interest rate, the higher the borrowing costs for the company, leading to an adverse impact on its ability to acquire or develop real estate. We expect interest expenses to increase 46.7% in 2023 on year-over-year basis.Analysts seem bearish regarding PSA’s FFO growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past six months, shares of PSA have declined 6.4%, wider than its industry's fall of 1.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

New cars made today can have as many as 3,000 chips per vehicle, meaning a long battle between major automakers and the UAW union could eventually start to weigh on production and chip suppliers.Texas Instruments (TXN) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are among the largest auto chip manufacturers in the world, while TSMC (TSM) is the leading contract chip manufacturer. Shares of all three chipmakers moved lower on Friday.And more chipmakers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Micron (MU) could see effects over time too, as both have substantial connected car businesses. Qualcomm has doubled down on its auto business in recent years, while Micron is often discussed as the market leader when it comes to auto memory chips.The impact on these companies varies based on a few factors, including the length of the strike and each company's exposure to automakers. The UAW has opted for a ""stand up"" strike, in which workers walk out at select GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants rather than all at once, in order to prolong the action and the union's $825 million strike fund.In 2022, 52% of NXP's total revenue came from its automotive chips, according to Counterpoint Research, while Texas Instruments derived 25% of its total revenue from the industry, company reports showed. At the same time, TSMC reported that its automotive segment accounted for just 5% of its total revenue.Estimated cost of the UAW labor strike.Diversification is key when it comes to suppliers' resilience in these circumstances, Anderson Economic Group COO Tyler Theile told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday (video above). Overall, Theile said, a 10-day UAW strike could have an impact of over $5 billion in the US alone, with broader impacts globally.Story continuesThe 2019 GM strike that lasted 42 days offers clues as to what might happen.""In 2019, we saw suppliers that were 90% or more focused on supplying to GM have to shut down and completely lay off all of their workers for a number of days,"" Theile said. ""If you're a supplier that's more diversified among several OEMs, maybe you're not as impacted as quickly or as strongly.""There could be far-ranging effects on the economy broadly — but it will have to be a pretty extreme situation to get there.""In 2019, if you look at the seasonally adjusted data, the strike did push Michigan in the United States into a single-state, single-quarter recession,"" Theile said. ""So it would take a lot for this to hit, for example, multiple states or the US data and important economic indicators, like GDP, as a whole, but it's not out of the question if a quite lengthy strike is sustained.""GM workers with the UAW Local 2250 Union strike outside the General Motors Wentzville Assembly Plant on Sept. 15, 2023, in Wentzville, Mo. (Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images) (Michael B. Thomas via Getty Images)However, not all tech companies are set to be negatively affected down the supply chain amid a strike. Tesla (TSLA) is set to be a winner, especially if the strike proves lengthy.""Non-union Tesla does not face similar issues which speaks to the complexity both GM and Ford face going up against the EV leader Tesla while trying to satisfy rising union demands,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Sept. 14. ""If a strike happens (and is lengthy) then ultimately production and the EV roadmap could be pushed out into 2024 and delays would be on the horizon at this crucial period for GM, Ford, and Stellantis.""""We believe a strike lasting longer than 4 weeks would be a body blow to the EV ambitions of GM and Ford in 1H24 and delay many aspects of this initial important EV push,"" Ives added.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Brinker’s Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues LagBrinker International reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by improved menu pricing and a favorable menu item mix.Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionIn the quarter under review, Brinker reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. The company reported an adjusted EPS of $1.15 in the prior-year quarter.In the fiscal fourth quarter, total revenues of $1,075.5 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,079 million.

The company gained from the solid performance of Chili's and Maggiano's.Chili'sChili’s revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter increased 5.5% year over year to $954.1 million. The upside was primarily driven by increased menu pricing and a favorable menu item mix. However, this was partially offset by lower traffic.Chili's restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal fourth quarter came in at 87.1% year over year compared with 88% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily due to sales leverage, menu pricing, favorable commodity mix, lower delivery and off-premise supplies. A rise in commodity costs, advertising expenses and hourly wage rates partially offset this.Chili's company-owned traffic in the quarter declined 7.7% year over year compared with a fall of 5.7% reported in the prior-year quarter.The segment’s company-owned comps increased 6.3% in the fiscal fourth quarter from the year-ago quarter’s levels.At Chili’s, domestic comps (including company-owned and franchised) rose 6% year over year compared with 0.1% rise in the prior-year quarter’s levels.Story continuesMaggiano’sMaggiano’s sales rose 3.5% year over year to $121.2 million. the upside was driven by a rise in menu pricing. However, this was partially offset by unfavorable menu item mix and lower traffic. Comps in the segment increased 9.1% year over year. Traffic in the quarter fell 0.2% year over year against a 17.9% rise reported in the prior-year quarter.Maggiano's company restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal fourth quarter were 82.7% compared with 84% reported in the prior-year quarter.

The restaurant operating margin, as a percentage of company sales, was 13.4% compared with 12.5% reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAs of Jun 28, 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $15.1 million compared with $13.8 million as of Mar 29, 2023.Long-term debt as of Jun 28, 2023, was $912.2 million compared with $930.7 million as of Mar 29, 2023.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.95bUS$9.51bUS$9.79bUS$10.4bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bUS$11.6bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.09%Est @ 3.51%Est @ 3.10%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.62%Est @ 2.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$8.3kUS$8.1kUS$7.8kUS$7.7kUS$7.4kUS$7.1kUS$6.7kUS$6.4kUS$6.1kUS$5.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$71bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.2%) = US$217bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$217b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$100bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$171b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$278, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.183. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McDonald'sStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

We also reviewed Dalio's top 10 stock picks in 2023. You can skip our detailed discussion about Ray Dalio and jump directly to the Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks.After stepping down from official roles last year, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is pursuing his passions and seeking to transfer his wisdom in various ways to help others succeed. He begins each day by closely monitoring the markets and spends 6 to 8 hours per day conducting research, which he refers to as ""digging."" The legendary investor, who founded Bridgewater Associates in his two-room apartment and grew it into one of the largest investment management firms with approximately $195 billion in assets under management, also frequently appears on news channels and YouTube videos. He also remains active on active on Twitter and other social platforms to present his stance on economic, political, and other global challenges. Although he stepped down as co-chief investment officer last year and no longer participates in day-to-day matters to pursue his passions, he still has a significant influence on Bridgewater's investing decisions. He is still on the operating board and serves as the investment committee's mentor. His ability to predict future market movements due to his strong understanding of macroeconomics and global world order has helped his firm make money over the last five decades. He had predicted the 2008 financial crisis as early as 2006. As his firm was well prepared for the impending financial crisis, its flagship Pure Alpha strategy was up 8.7% after fees in 2008. Besides that event, Dalio's firm has a history of making noteworthy moves. In 2022, his firm built over $10 billion in short positions in European stocks because of the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, in 2018, his firm opened $22 billion worth of short positions in Europe and made a $14 billion bet against European stocks in 2020. Story continuesMost recently, following his visit to China in April 2023, the American billionaire published a LinkedIn post about China-US tensions. He advised the world's two largest economies to maintain good political and trade relations because he believed even the prospects of war would be a drag on markets and global economic activity. However, he also warned that both countries are on the verge of war: What I mean when I say that the US and China are on the brink of war is that it appears that they are close to having a sanctions war and/or military war that neither side wants but many believe will probably happen because a) each side is very close to the other’s red lines, b) each side is using brinksmanship to push the other at the risk of crossing each other’s red lines, and c) politics will probably cause more aggressive brinksmanship over the next 18 months. I want to emphasize that by saying that they are on the brink, I don’t mean to say that they will necessarily go over the brink. I mean to say that they are very close to crossing red lines that, if crossed, will irrevocably push them over the brink into some type of war that damages these two countries and causes damage to the world order in severe and irrevocable ways—like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did for Russia and the world, just much bigger. Dalio has also been vocal about his long-held fascination with China. He is also well-liked in China, where his investment firm operates a wealth management business, becoming the largest foreign hedge fund last year with nearly $3 billion in investments, more than doubling the previous year. Since its inception in 2018, Bridgewater's main China fund has generated an annual return of 15.6% through October 2022. In one of his LinkedIn posts, he stated that the Chinese economy needs a big debt restructuring. However, he added that debt restructuring would be easier because the majority of its debt is in its own currency: So, how do those who reduce the debt burdens do it? It primarily depends on whether the debt is in one’s own currency or a foreign currency (if it’s in one’s own currency like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage) and whether it is held by one’s own citizens or foreigners (if it’s held by one’s own citizens like China’s debt is, it’s easier to manage)—though it is never easy. Given these circumstances, it also depends on how the restructuring is done. A well-done restructuring happens in a balanced way. I call that a “beautiful deleveraging.” It balances deflationary defaults/restructurings with inflationary printing of money/debt monetization to spread out the burden. The mechanics of this process are explained in the first chapter of the book linked above, so I won’t try to squeeze them in here.While Bridgewater appears to be doing well in competitive Chinese markets, the firm is continuing to reduce its exposure to Chinese stocks listed on the US stock exchange. Ray Dalio's firm sold nearly a third of its stake in Chinese stocks during the second quarter. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) and Zhihu Inc. (NYSE:ZH) are among the 13 companies that the firm has exited in the second quarter. Dalio's Bridgewater held $480 million in 31 US-listed Chinese companies at the end of the June quarter. Meanwhile, the 13F filing also revealed that Dalio used exchange-traded funds such as the iShares MSCI China ETF and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF to diversify his exposure to China.  What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days - Top 10 Stock Picks in 2023Our MethodologyAs Ray Dalio continues to mentor the investment committee and his philosophy dominates investment moves, paying attention to Bridgewater's stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Bridgewater's second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.What Ray Dalio Is Doing These Days? - Top 10 Stock Picks in 202310. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $234 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 366Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been one of Ray Dalio's favorite stock holdings over the last decade, but the firm has significantly increased its position in the tech giant during the 2022 bear market when its shares were trading at a significantly lower price. Dalio's strategy of buying on the dip worked because Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares have risen by a whopping 50% year to date. The recovery in ad revenue, combined with a focus on AI technology, has increased investor confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). During the company's second-quarter conference call, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the importance of artificial intelligence, stating that the company is working to incorporate AI into its products.In the first half investor letter, Pershing Square Holdings, an investment holding company, explained the reasons for creating a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Here is what the firm stated about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG):“Earlier this year, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. We believe that Google is one of the world’s greatest businesses with deep barriers to entry and massive network effects underpinning its core search business. After having closely followed the company for many years, we had the opportunity to acquire a stake in Google at a highly attractive valuation as misplaced concerns over its competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and its strong growth prospects.Google is the dominant leader in the fast-growing digital advertising market. Google has 85%+ market share in search and, along with YouTube, approximately 50% share of the digital advertising market. With higher and improving returns on investment, we expect digital ads to continue to take market share from traditional ad formats like TV and print, and increasingly drive the total advertising market growth above its historical trend. For example, in retail, rising e-commerce penetration is catalyzing the migration of offline promotion and trade spend dollars into digital ads. With Search and YouTube as two of the highest return and most resilient ad formats, Google is well positioned to benefit from the structural growth in digital ad share across many categories.Similarly, in its Cloud business, Google is a top three player in an oligopolistic market that is in the early stages of a multi[1]year shift of IT workloads from on-premise to cloud and hybrid cloud solutions. These powerful secular tailwinds have enabled Google to grow overall revenues at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the last five years which should continue to support near- double-digit top-line growth in the coming years…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $241 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 175Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Ray Dalio's Bridgewater's strategy of increasing its stake in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) during last year's bear market has so far rewarded his firm. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock is up more than 24% year to date. Dalio's hedge fund maintained its confidence in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by holding nearly one million shares at the end of the June quarter, up 3% from the previous quarter. The latest financial results and outlook from the company indicate that there is still room for growth. Revenue of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) increased by 7% year over year in the June quarter, while earnings per share of $2.16 topped the estimate of $2.12. The second quarter earnings were also up from $2.09 in the previous quarter and $1.98 in the same period last year.   In the second quarter investor letter, Baron Funds, an investment management company, identified Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) as a high-conviction idea in their fund. Here is what the fund stated about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated, and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo, Visa announced its intention to acquire the Brazilian company for $1 billion in late June.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $269 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 60Bridgewater's strategy of buying stocks at low prices has worked in the case of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), as it has for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Throughout late 2020 and early 2021, Ray Dalio's fund steadily increased its position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Although the firm sold some stake in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in late 2022, it again raised its position in the coffeehouse company by 10% in the June quarter to 2.72 million shares. In addition to share price appreciation, Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) healthy dividend yield of 2.20% makes it an attractive stock to hold for the long term. However, some investment management firms are pessimistic about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) performance ahead. The London Company, an investment management company, stated in its second-quarter investor letter that uncertain market conditions could negatively impact the performance of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Here is what the firm said about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX):“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $402 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 83Ray Dalio's hedge fund has been selling its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) over the last few quarters in order to capitalize on the share price gains it has generated over the last three years. The firm reduced its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from approximately 4.7 million shares in the second quarter of 2022 to approximately 2.56 million shares at the end of the June quarter of 2023. Despite this, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is Ray Dalio's seventh largest stock holding, with a total value of $402 million. The fund appears to have benefited from its stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) because shares of the company have risen sharply since it established its position in Q3 2020. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), pays out healthy dividends. It is a dividend aristocrat with a 49-year dividend growth history. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was in the 81 hedge funds in the second quarter, according to data tracked by Insider Monkey. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater is among the largest hedge fund investors in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).6. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $423 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been a major stockholding of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates over the last three years. In the third quarter of 2020, the firm began building a stake in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and by early 2022, its stake had grown to 2.1 million shares. However, since then, Dalio’s firm has been lowering its stake in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to capitalize on the recent share price rally and allocate money to other opportunities. Despite this, the firm still held 1.4 million shares of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) valued at $423 million as of the end of the June quarter, making it the portfolio's sixth largest holding. Like  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is also among the best dividend payers. It has raised dividends in the past 21 consecutive years.  McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was in 68 hedge fund portfolios as of the end of the second quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is among the largest shareholders in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). Click to continue reading and see Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stock Picks in 2023.     Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Reddit10 Best Silver ETFs15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDDisclosure: None.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.4%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Even while not generating a profit, Seagate Technology Holdings is paying out most of its free cash flows as a dividend. Generally paying a dividend without making profits isn't a great idea and we are also worried that there is limited reinvestment into the business.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 55%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.28 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.1% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past five years, it looks as though Seagate Technology Holdings' EPS has declined at around 12% a year. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Story continuesSeagate Technology Holdings' Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Seagate Technology Holdings' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

""Treating the underlying cause of CF as early as possible in life has the potential to slow disease progression, which is why we are pleased the CHMP is supportive of expanding the indication for KAFTRIO to patients as young as 2 years.""In the European Union, KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor is already approved for the treatment of people with CF ages 6 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 88,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.Story continuesAbout KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in A Combination Regimen With IvacaftorIn people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by binding to different sites on the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor is approved in the European Union for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.For complete product information, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics that can be found on www.ema.europa.eu.U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)INDICATIONS AND USAGETRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with TRIKAFTA.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $23.7 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer engineering support, logistics management, product support analysis and integration, maintenance planning, technical data, and support equipment maintenance for the P-8A aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and the governments of Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL and Whidbey Island, WA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and a solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost Boeing’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been getting ample contracts for supplying its defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.7% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT .Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. It also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a 5.6% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT’s 2023 sales implies a 1% improvement from the previous year’s reported number.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of its renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%.

ERJ recently secured an order from Air Peace, a Nigeria-based airline company, for delivering five of its E175 jets valued at $288.3 million. This should boost Embraer’s revenues, starting from 2024, when the deliveries of these jets will commence.With Air Peace, the largest airline in West Africa, upgrading its fleet from the existing 50-seater ERJ145 to 88-seater E175, Embraer may witness more aircraft orders from the airline, like the latest one. This should significantly boost ERJ’s order book and thereby revenues.Growth Prospects of EmbraerSteady growth observed in air passenger traffic over the past few months, wearing down the impacts of the pandemic, has once again bolstered the prospects of the commercial aerospace industry. Also, the ease of traveling restrictions in China has lately added to the recovery of the industry.Per a report released by the International Air Transport Association in July 2023, the recovery of global passenger traffic measured by Revenue Passenger Kilometers (“RPK”) has been strong, reaching 95.6% of the 2019 level.Amid this backdrop, commercial aircraft makers like Embraer continue to witness strong demand for jets worldwide, particularly ERJ’s E-jets. Impressively, in the second quarter, the company delivered 47 E-jets, an increase of 47% compared to the second quarter last year.Considering the favorable trends in the commercial aerospace industry to prevail in the coming days, the outlook for this industry remains bright. Total global RPKs are expected to increase by 20% in 2023.Such solid opportunities prevalent in the air travel business should boost the growth of Embraer’s commercial aviation business, thus boosting its overall revenue generation prospects.Peers to GainApart from Embraer, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that may gain from the flourishing demand for aircraft are as follows:Airbus EADSY: It delivered 189 commercial aircraft in the second quarter, thus registering growth of 21.9% year over year.EADSY expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2023.Story continuesThe long-term earnings growth of Airbus stands at 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales calls for a growth rate of 17.8%.Boeing BA: It remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries.

272,b4d1ab85-72fa-37fc-8ac9-a3d725a45c31,NSC,2023-09-16,Norfolk Southern CEO promises to keep improving safety on the railroad based on consultant's report,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-ceo-promises-keep-201743032.html,1694809063,STORY,['NSC'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Norfolk Southern's CEO pledged to continue working to improve safety after consultant the railroad hired following the fiery Ohio derailment recommended making sure that safety is truly a priority at all levels and continuing many efforts it has already begun.CEO Alan Shaw told the railroad's employees in a letter Thursday that Norfolk Southern will take several immediate steps in response to the initial report Atkins Nuclear Secured delivered including strengthening the way it responds to any safety incident and establishing a dedicated team to work on implementing the consultant's recommendations.The railroad industry has been in the spotlight ever since the February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border prompted evacuations, health worries, a massive ongoing cleanup and calls for reforms.“I know that each of you feels as strongly as I do that we need to do everything we can to prevent accidents that can impact communities like East Palestine in the future,” Shaw said in his letter to employees. “To be an industry leader requires us to raise the bar. And that is exactly what we are doing.”A previous report from the Federal Railroad Administration said that Norfolk Southern had too often been content to do only the minimum required to ensure safety. The Atkins consultant echoed some of the same themes in its recommendations but also said it found “outstanding leaders at all levels devoted to safety” and praised the railroad's strong response to the East Palestine derailment that includes pledging more than $74 million to that community. Just Thursday, the railroad announced a $4.3 million grant to help the city overhaul its water treatment system.Atkins said Norfolk Southern needs to do a better job of making sure everyone throughout the railroad learns the lessons from safety incidents and should continue hiring to fill critical shortages while trying to reduce the pressure on managers and doing more to coach employees to improve instead of disciplining them for minor concerns.Story continuesShaw said this report is just one of the initial steps to improve safety on the railroad and Atkins will continue to recommend improvements over the next couple years. Norfolk Southern also said in the immediate aftermath of the East Palestine derailment that it would add more trackside detectors to help spot mechanical problems before they can cause derailments and work with the rest of the industry to evaluate how to respond to warnings from those detectors.Norfolk Southern and all the major freight railroads also promised to join the Federal Railroad Administration's anonymous safety reporting system, but so far they haven't been able to reach an agreement to do that because they want to retain the ability to discipline workers in certain circumstances.Norfolk Southern has been working to repair its strained relationships with its unions this year by addressing some of their quality of life concerns about the lack of paid sick time and demanding schedules. The consultant recommended that the railroad continue to work with labor leaders to find additional ways to improve safety.Shaw said he's going to establish a new vice president to encourage workers to share more suggestions on how to improve safety and operations although that person will have to find ways to overcome rail workers' fears of retaliation if they do speak out.While working to improve safety, Norfolk Southern also pledged to make improvements to more than 70 of its facilities across 22 states in the eastern United States as part of an effort to improve morale.]"
273,29d6a8ed-e7f0-3dde-8651-a88a41df89b3,NSC,2023-09-16,Norfolk Southern to create executive role as part of safety revamp,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-create-executive-role-193856650.html,1694806736,STORY,['NSC'],"[Norfolk Southern received a report on its safety practices from consulting firm Atkins Nuclear Secured. (Photo: JIm Allen/FreightWaves)Norfolk Southern plans to create an executive role focused on field engagement in response to the initial findings of an independent consultancy that NS hired to scrutinize the eastern U.S. Class I railroad’s safety culture.That role “will work across organizational boundaries, engaging our front-line railroaders for ideas on how to make Norfolk Southern better, identifying further opportunities to enhance working conditions for our colleagues in the field, and strengthening our safety and service culture,” said NS President and CEO Alan Shaw in a Thursday letter to employees about the findings from Atkins Nuclear Secured (ANS).NS (NYSE: NSC) retained ANS to examine the railroad’s safety practices following the Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio. Several days after the derailment, NS and state and local officials decided to vent a tank car carrying vinyl chloride over concern that the car was in danger of exploding.The derailment, which put NS and the freight rail industry in the nation’s hot seat, also prompted federal regulators and the unions to question how precision scheduled railroading (PSR) might have influenced safety at NS and other railroads. PSR is a tool that the railroads use to streamline operations and cut costs.ANS’ report, which NS said was released just at the start of a multiyear process to enhance the railroad’s safety culture and operations, listed four areas where NS might seek to improve. A safety implementation task force will work with ANS on implementing the recommendations.“Moving forward on building an industry-leading, safety-first operation requires everyone across our organization — from management to the craft employees who comprise the backbone of the company — to work together toward a common mission. We will succeed by working collaboratively, deliberately, and with urgency,” Shaw said.The report listed 11 recommendations where there were “key opportunities for improvement,” as well as seven other areas of potential improvement.Story continuesThe full list of recommendations is available here.Shaw summarized the recommendations into an outline with four main points: strengthen collaboration with local leaders and welcome feedback that would create innovative solutions;  enhance post-incident improvement policies by strengthening NS’ fact-finding processes and root cause analysis, then deploying corrective actions accordingly; invest in locations and reporting facilities as a way to improve morale and workplace pride; and expand NS’ field assessment team in order to teach and develop field leaders as they seek to strengthen and reinforce employee safety behaviors.NS seeks to develop its safety implementation plan by October, and it expects to consult with ANS on the implementation of this plan for the next two to three years.ANS’ report echoes some of the observations that the Federal Railroad Administration made last month when the agency released its review of NS’ safety practices. Keeping communication lines open, fostering mutual trust between the company and employees, ensuring adequate training and resources, and developing a more proactive safety culture were some of FRA’s recommendations.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:FRA, OSHA call on Norfolk Southern to review safety practicesNS works to move past $803M hit from Ohio derailmentOhio presses Biden for disaster relief for East PalestineWitness testifies freight car involved in NS train derailment was not inspectedNTSB examines communication gaps at East Palestine train derailment hearingThe post Norfolk Southern to create executive role as part of safety revamp appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Per Stryker, the platform, designed for improved visualization of blood flow and critical anatomy, is expected to have the ability to visualize multiple optical imaging agents at times when it matters most.Per medical personnel familiar with the camera platform, dependable imaging is one of the most critical factors during surgical outcomes.

MA’s shares declined 0.7% on Sep 14, replicating declines in broader markets.The cobranded credit card can be easily applied digitally via the talabat app. Such card launches by Mastercard are meant to offer increased benefits and choices to its cardholders. Benefits in the form of lucrative rewards for day-to-day delivery orders can be obtained by the users of the newly launched card. The recent partnership reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to pave the way for safe and seamless digital transactions and thereby, provide an impetus to the shift to ecommerce on delivery of food and grocery items across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The support of a tech giant like Mastercard, whose digital arm is built with the help of partnerships and substantial technology investments, infuses a sense of confidence and security to MENA’s consumers, riders and restaurants in the greater adoption of digital payments.Moves similar to the latest one are means to expand the payment network of Mastercard, which is integral to its aim of providing greater choice and flexibility in transactions using multiple payment rails, such as cards, real-time payments, account-to-account transactions and crypto. Increased utilization of its card offerings may boost transaction volumes and fetch greater revenues to the tech giant.Apart from infusing greater digitization within the MENA region’s payments landscape, the card launch may strengthen the ties shared between Mastercard and Delivery Hero. The collaboration between the companies was announced in 2020 and Mastercard was entrusted with the responsibility to digitize the payment chain of Delivery Hero’s brands operating across the MENA region. Food order transactions on Delivery Hero’s apps using Mastercard-branded cards have more than doubled over the 2020-2022 period in the region.Story continuesMA’s keen eye to establish a solid footprint in the MENA region is due to its rapidly growing digital economy, spurred by increased Internet penetration and higher usage of smartphones, thereby providing a perfect ground for MA to capitalize on with its suite of affordable payment solutions.Just a day before the recent move was announced, MA partnered with Somalia's Amal Bank, one of the largest in the country in terms of branch network and customers, to launch Classic and Platinum debit cards. The tie-up is meant to promote widespread adoption of digital means across the MENA nation.Shares of Mastercard have gained 31.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 17.1% growth.  MA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are SPX Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:LYB)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-lyondellbasell-120213444.html,1694865733,STORY,['LYB'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at LyondellBasell Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries What's The Opportunity In LyondellBasell Industries?Great news for investors – LyondellBasell Industries is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $162.19, but it is currently trading at US$100 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because LyondellBasell Industries’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of LyondellBasell Industries look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 69% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for LyondellBasell Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since LYB is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LYB for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy LYB. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to UnitedHealth Group's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$22b ÷ US$92b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.24 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirst thing first, we like that UnitedHealth Group has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for UnitedHealth Group's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 11% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is UNH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is UnitedHealth Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 30% (implying that the company retains 70% of its profits), it seems that UnitedHealth Group is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, UnitedHealth Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 25%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that UnitedHealth Group's future ROE will be 25% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that UnitedHealth Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

Regency is well-poised to benefit from its strategically located shopping centers in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas amid this favorable fundamental of the retail real estate market. Its focus on grocery-anchored shopping centers assures dependable traffic and has aided occupancy levels and rent growth in recent quarters.This August, Regency closed the previously announced buyout of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. in an all-stock transaction. This created a combined company with a total equity market capitalization of more than $11 billion and an enterprise value of more than $16 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us now decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price and also check whether this trend will last.Regency continues to benefit from its focus on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Such centers are usually necessity-driven and attract dependable traffic. In the uncertain times, the grocery component has benefited retail REITs, including Regency. Encouragingly, this retail REIT has a high-quality open-air shopping center portfolio, with 80% grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers. Moreover, the company’s focus on necessity, service, convenience and value retailers serving the essential needs of the communities provides it with an unequaled strategic advantage. We expect a year-over-year increase of 3.1% in lease income in the current year.REG’s premium shopping centers are situated in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power, enabling the company to attract top grocers and retailers. Furthermore, the best-in-class operators are opening new locations in its high-quality centers. With more people moving to suburbs due to the post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban shopping center portfolio is expected to garner long-term benefits.These factors have helped the company’s performance, and from the beginning of 2023 through Jun 30, 2023, REG’s same-property base rent grew 4% on a year-over-year basis, aiding same-property net operating income (NOI) growth of 5%, excluding termination fees or collection of 2020/2021 reserves.Regency is also making efforts to improve its portfolio with acquisitions and developments in key markets. Its acquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties is projected to be immediately accretive to core operating earnings. With the combined portfolio comprising 480 properties and encompassing more than 56 million square feet of gross leasable area, the move enhances Regency's geographic diversification, tenant mix, growth prospects and balance sheet strength.As of Jun 30, 2023, Regency’s in-process development and redevelopment projects estimated net project costs of around $410 million at the company’s share. Given REG’s prudent financial management, it is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Regency maintains a healthy balance sheet position. This retail REIT had around $1.2 billion available under its revolving credit facility as of Jun 30, 2023. As of the same date, its pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDAre ratio was 4.9, while the fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.8. Additionally, the company has no unsecured debt maturities until June 2024. This low leverage with limited near-term maturities offers flexibility to REG. Regency also enjoys a large pool of unencumbered assets. As of Jun 30, 2023, 90.4% of its wholly owned real estate assets were unencumbered. With a high percentage of such assets, the company can enjoy accessibility to the secured and unsecured debt markets and maintain availability on the line.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest attractions for REIT investors, and Regency is committed to boosting shareholder wealth. For the 2014-2022 period, the company’s dividend has witnessed a CAGR of 3.8%.Furthermore, in the last five years, Regency has increased its dividend four times. Therefore, given the company’s solid operating platform, scope for growth and decent financial position compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable over the long run.However, higher e-commerce adoption and the efforts of online retailers to go deeper into the grocery business raise concerns for Regency Centers. A high-interest-rate environment adds to the company’s woes.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

292,95d12c2c-2f17-3f54-93ca-c43dc06e5d5a,ADP,2023-09-16,Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automatic-data-processing-nasdaq-adp-120248174.html,1694865768,STORY,"['ADP', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing What Is Automatic Data Processing's Debt?As you can see below, Automatic Data Processing had US$3.10b of debt, at June 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it also had US$2.10b in cash, and so its net debt is US$997.4m.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Automatic Data Processing's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Automatic Data Processing had liabilities of US$42.8b due within a year, and liabilities of US$4.69b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.10b and US$3.01b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$42.4b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Automatic Data Processing has a huge market capitalization of US$102.3b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk. Carrying virtually no net debt, Automatic Data Processing has a very light debt load indeed.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Automatic Data Processing's net debt is only 0.20 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 43.9 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Also good is that Automatic Data Processing grew its EBIT at 19% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Automatic Data Processing can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Automatic Data Processing produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 74% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewAutomatic Data Processing's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its net debt to EBITDA also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Automatic Data Processing's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Automatic Data Processing, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Procter &amp; Gamble, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Procter &amp; Gamble does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Procter &amp; Gamble's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Procter &amp; Gamble is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.7% and 4.4% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$183m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 34% stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Procter &amp; Gamble , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

301,c8b993a0-bcb7-3848-a2e6-05a83c2f8c9e,AAL,2023-09-16,Airline stocks: Three factors impacting the industry,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/airline-stocks-three-factors-impacting-222420323.html,1694816660,VIDEO,"['ALK', 'LUV', 'UAL', 'SAVE', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[A number of airlines including American (AAL), Spirit (SAVE), and Southwest (LUV) have warned about the impact of higher jet fuel costs. Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials Materials and Energy Peter McNally highlights three issues impacting the industry right now. The three issues McNally cites are the increase in international travel, costs, and capacity. Capacity has become an issue, he says, because now that suppliers are delivering planes, there are more seats, and that's putting ""downward pressure"" on fares. ""Airlines have less pricing power now than they do at any point since the recovery began,"" McNally adds.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Airline stocks hitting some turbulence with several major airlines cutting guidance in recent weeks, largely due to higher jet fuel costs. American Airlines now expects third quarter earnings of $0.20 and $0.30 per share. That's sharply lower than its previous estimate of around $0.85 to $0.95 a share.Low cost carrier Spirit now sees revenue between $1.24 billion and $1.25 billion in the third quarter. Southwest, United Airlines, and Alaska all issuing new guidance on how much they're expecting to spend on jet fuel.Joining us now, we've got Peter McNally, Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials, Materials, and Energy. Peter, great to speak with you as always here. If I may summon back into the chat, Southwest specifically here. Because I think they gave a warning that was a little bit more telling about the consumer, especially on that low end here.How much of a warning shot was that to the state of this kind of travel resurgence, that many of these CEOs had said is locked in place, is good to go. We are in a countercyclical recovery on that front?PETER MCNALLY: Well, there's a few things going on here, you know, in the industry. One, I think we've seen in particular this summer, there's been a shift to international. People have been traveling domestically for a few years now since the recovery. And that's where we think we've seen the outperformance in major airlines like United, Delta, and American on their top line, serving those customers.Story continuesBut costs as well is one more factor. And then the third thing that we haven't seen really in four years is capacity. And more planes are being put into service. Airlines have been aggressive in ordering. And finally, Boeing and Airbus are getting their supply chains together. These planes are being delivered. There's more supply of seats, and that's putting some downward pressure on fares here.And we're going into a seasonally softer period for demand. So this is going to be the state of play we think for the next few months in the industry.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Peter, you know, I'm thinking back to last year when we saw really energy prices spike in a big way on the back of the Russia-Ukraine war. Airlines did raise their prices, and yet there was this continued demand from consumers who were in the middle of what we characterize as revenge travel. Is the airlines have that same pricing power this time around, even as they see their own costs add up? Because consumers, as you point out, aren't in the same place.PETER MCNALLY: Now it's different now. The situation has eroded with these additional aircrafts that are coming into service. And yes, fares have gotten high for sure. And people do want to travel. We wouldn't argue that. And we are through at least on the leisure side in terms of passenger numbers where we were in 2019. Business still has a way to go and so does international. But airlines have less pricing power now than they do at any point since the recovery began.BRAD SMITH: You mentioned something really interesting in why customers continue to book and that it's interactional. If more of the bookings are for an interactional-- excuse me-- purpose, then does that lead to a kind of leisure malaise here, of people who are just kind of booking travel for the sake of the experience of it all?PETER MCNALLY: Well, look I mean, there's always a few things to consider here. But I think one thing that should not be underestimated in this is that airlines still don't have change fees. So it's allowing people to book and then have a lot more flexibility on when and where they go.And I think what we were seeing earlier this year was people just booking to make sure that they got a seat, you know, frankly. And, you know, now at this point, like, there are more seats available, made available by these airlines with these new aircraft. And they've paid their labor, you know, whether it's pilots, flight attendants, you know, more money to get these planes in the air. But I think that's kind of the key part of the dynamic now.AKIKO FUJITA: To what extent has the rough experience is probably putting it mildly what we've seen in the summer, airlines being canceled, the constant delays, I mean, how has that been eating into not just the experience but also this travel demand? I mean, have you seen a dent on the back of it? Maybe I'm just speaking from personal experience here.But it is-- you have to wonder how frustrating it is to have to go through repeatedly in the airlines as well as the Department of Transportation has made it very clear, there is a rough patch that's happening right now partly because of staffing, but partly because of other factors as well.PETER MCNALLY: It's been frustrating for sure. But people keep coming back. Our experts would argue this summer that the disruptions really were weather-driven. United was the big one this time. But if we roll back to last Christmas, the Southwest debacle was pretty much self-inflicted. It was an IT system that melted down. It's been something that's kind of plagued the company for years, that our experts would have been citing.Prior to that, it had been getting pilots paid it off and trained to fly these things. But lately it's been more about weather. This could change as demand continues to grow. But people come back. And look, driving isn't that cheap and flying can get you there like pretty quick. But the underlying demand is still there.BRAD SMITH: All right, Peter, we got to leave things there. Of course, we could continue to talk to you all day about this. Third Bridge Global Sector Lead for Industrials, Materials, and Energy. Peter, have a great weekend.PETER MCNALLY: You too. Take care.]"

The fresh investments will be directed to replacing and upgrading 5,000 feet of sewer mains in the City of McKeesport and installing a new vault to store wastewater during significant storm.Pennsylvania American Water’s McKeesport system serves nearly 12,000 customers. Since the acquisition of McKeesport’s wastewater system in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water has already invested in McKeesport’s wastewater infrastructure and plans to invest an additional $35.4 million during the next five years.The amount invested and planned to be invested in the upgrade of the system will improve the reliability of services and the water quality in the Youghiogheny and Monongahela Rivers.Pennsylvania American Water has been expanding its operations through acquisitions and is also making essential investments to upgrade and maintain its acquired assets. In 2022, Pennsylvania American Water invested nearly $490 million to improve our water and wastewater treatment and pipeline systems. The company has made significant investments this year and will continue to do so in the remainder of 2023.Investments: A Must for Aging InfrastructuresTo provide uninterrupted water and wastewater services to millions of customers across the United States, water utilities have to maintain and upgrade their infrastructure. The repair and upgrade of water and sewage pipelines, water treatment plants and storage tanks are quite essential. A vast majority of these essential infrastructures are nearing the end of their effective service lives.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure, like storage tanks and purifying units, needs maintenance at proper intervals.Per the ASCE report, nearly 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost each day in the United States due to water main breaks every two minutes. This wastage of potable water is increasing the cost of operations for water utilities. The pipeline breaks can also increase the risk of contamination of potable water.Story continuesInvestments Coming From UtilitiesLarge water utilities are making investments in upgrading infrastructure, but the highly fragmented water industry remains a major headwind. Small water suppliers lack the financial strength to make essential repairs, which leads to pipeline breaks and interruptions of services in some areas.Water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water Company MSEX, among others, have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve the water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology.California Water Service plans to invest more than $625 million in capital expenditures through 2024.Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG and CWT’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 5.1% and 7.9%, respectively.

Yahoo Finance Reporters Josh Schafer, Alexandra Canal, and Pras Subramanian analyze why American consumers may be choosing not to start the day with a bowl of classic breakfast brands.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: A great story in the Wall Street Journal today talking about cereal sales. This is ahead of General Mills reporting earnings next week. General Mills is the biggest supplier or seller of cereals in the country. But interesting when you take a look at overall cereal sales. So you saw that they jumped 5.2% in 2020. Apparently, during the pandemic, for some reason, we wanted more cereal. And then you go to 2021, down 8.7%. 2022, down 3.9%.To me, it's just because cereal is not that good. And we have better options for breakfast. I don't know what you guys make of this coming down. But I don't know how some of these companies, like, the article really gets into, you know, even for General Mills, how do you keep getting people to eat breakfast with you? What sort of different products can you create? And I think anything even cereal adjacent just isn't really breakfast, and people have slowly realized that.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. I do think there's a shift--JOSH SCHAFER: There's a nutritional value problem here that just exists.ALEXANDRA CANAL: -- a shift to more protein-based breakfast, eggs. I just-- I think the consumers more health conscious than we were in the '80s. Personally, for me, I love breakfast, but I never eat it during the workweek. I love going to brunch on the weekends. But I feel like, when I'm getting up, I'm rushing to get out the door, I don't get hungry right away either. So I'm not going to sit down and have a bowl of cereal.And for people that are rushing to work, too, and do need breakfast, usually they're having a bar. They're grabbing a shake. The act of sitting down and pouring yourself a milk into the cereal bowl and eating the bowl, that takes a lot of time. And I think the convenience factor is something that consumers appreciate more now.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, it's funny, I'm looking at, where are my high protein cereals at? Where is that at? Does it really exist? Unless you kind of order stuff online. The other thing is that kind of what you're talking about right now, Allie and Josh. She was like, we don't eat breakfast. I skip it as a choice.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I don't either.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Trying to like not really go into the fast part of the breakfast, right? Like, we're not eating it, we're not-- we're skipping it. We're going to something else. The other thing that kind of struck me in that article was about how the secret, the dirty little secret about cereal is, like, it's an adult indulgence. Adults buy it to eat at night.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So I will say--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: But that was funny.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I used to get like a few years ago, I would get boxes of Special K, and I would eat them--JOSH SCHAFER: Special K, that was your indulgence?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. But they have a lot of sugar.JOSH SCHAFER: No Captain Crunch? No Cinnamon Toast Crunch?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I'm trying--JOSH SCHAFER: Cocoa Puffs?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I would do the strawberry--JOSH SCHAFER: Special K Strawberry.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --which has a lot of sugar, and I would have that--JOSH SCHAFER: Wild Friday night with Special K strawberry.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I would eat it every now and then.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But it's not that healthy for you. And I think that's what people are starting to realize. And then you see companies like Kellogg's, which is just spinning off their cereal division, like, all right, you go over here. We'll focus on snacks, which is a lot more profitable. So you know, it'll be interesting to see if the future of the cereal can survive.JOSH SCHAFER: I think it's probably being more bars, like Pras was saying, right? And even just--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Remember, there was cereal bars.JOSH SCHAFER: Special K does make bars that are pretty good.ALEXANDRA CANAL: They have the milk, like the frozen milk bars.JOSH SCHAFER: Those were so good. The cinnamon-- they had Cinnamon Toast Crunch ones.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: They had frozen milk bars?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, it was like-- it was like a bar. And it had Fruit Loops. And then there was--JOSH SCHAFER: We solved cereals problem in two minutes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I mean, we had that.JOSH SCHAFER: They just need to bring those back. Those were amazing.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Whoa. OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I'll buy.]"

(AP) — Nebraska authorities said they don't expect any lingering problems related to Thursday's explosion of a railroad shipping container carrying an acid used to make explosives because the chemical largely burned off and any residue was contained at the scene.No one was injured in the blast at Union Pacific's massive railyard in North Platte, and no structures were damaged. A precautionary evacuation of a one-mile area right around the fire only involved a few farmsteads for several hours because the fire happened in the west end of the railyard near the edge of town. The fire didn't even spread beyond the shipping container on top of the one that exploded to the rest of the parked train.North Platte Fire Chief Dennis Thompson said Friday this was the best-case scenario for an incident like this because of its isolated location and the quick response from his hazardous materials team and other agencies, including the railroad's own experts. A team from the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency that happened to be passing through the area on the way to a training session in Western Nebraska even stopped to offer their expertise.“Especially when we look at some of the incidents that we’ve seen recently around the country, this just couldn’t have gone any better,” Thomson said. “When we leave these things with no injuries or significant damage or loss of equipment or anything, or environmental impact, it's a win by all means.”Any railroad incident these days brings to mind the fiery Norfolk Southern derailment that happened in eastern Ohio back in February. That crash prompted a national reckoning on rail safety and a massive cleanup effort that continues in East Palestine, Ohio. But Thursday's incident in the Union Pacific railyard was nothing like that.The perchloric acid inside the container that exploded, which is used to make explosives as well as a variety of food and drug products, dissipated in the air as it burned off, Thompson said. And air and soil monitoring in the area never showed any dangerous levels.Story continuesHe said the other container that burned in the fire likely contained memory foam — not another hazardous chemical.Investigators from the state Fire Marshal's office and the railroad are working to determine the cause of the blast.Union Pacific was able to continue operating part of the railyard throughout the incident, and full operations resumed after the fire was extinguished Thursday evening.The head of the Federal Railroad Administration did recently say that inspectors found an alarming number of defects among the freight cars and locomotives in use at the North Platte railyard, which is the world's largest, during an inspection this summer. But there' wasn't any immediate indication that Thursday's explosion were linked to those defects.Agency spokesman Warren Flatau said Friday the FRA is conducting a full investigation to determine what happened and whether any of the work being done moving other railcars nearby contributed to the explosion.North Platte is a city of about 23,000 people located about 230 miles (370 kilometers) east of Denver and about 250 miles (400 kilometers) west of Omaha.]"

(NYSE:AMP) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-institutional-ownership-ameriprise-financial-120208379.html,1694865728,STORY,['AMP'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Ameriprise Financial's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 16 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Ameriprise Financial. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Ameriprise Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ameriprise Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Ameriprise Financial is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$141m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Ameriprise Financial. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.
