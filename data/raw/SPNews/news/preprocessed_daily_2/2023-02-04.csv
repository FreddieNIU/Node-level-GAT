The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Charles Schwab's shares on or after the 9th of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 24th of February.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Charles Schwab stock has a trailing yield of around 1.3% on the current share price of $79.02. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Charles Schwab has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 24% of its income after tax.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Charles Schwab's earnings per share have risen 17% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Charles Schwab has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Charles Schwab an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. In summary, Charles Schwab appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Charles Schwab and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Further, by selecting stocks near or breaking out to new highs, investors find themselves in favorable trends where buyers have been in control.Three stocks – Nucor NUE, Applied Industrial Technologies AIT, and United Rentals URI – are all heading toward or breaking 52-week highs. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three have found plenty of buyers.In addition, all have witnessed favorable earnings estimate revisions as of late, providing shares the fuel they need. Let’s take a closer look at each one.United Rentals Inc. United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.URI has seen its earnings outlook improve across all timeframes as of late, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI sports a stellar growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar 27% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 10% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on the back of forecasted Y/Y revenue increases of 21% in FY23 and 2% in FY24.And for the cherry on top, URI’s trailing twelve-month return on equity (ROE) of 36% is well above its Zacks Industry average, indicating a higher level of efficiency in generating profit from existing assets.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApplied Industrial TechnologiesApplied Industrial Technologies distributes value-added industrial products, including engineered fluid power components, bearings, specialty flow control solutions, power transmission products, and miscellaneous industrial supplies.Story continuesAIT’s earnings outlook has drifted higher across the board, helping to fuel shares on their run.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the stock does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.9%. While the yield is below its Zacks sector average, AIT’s 3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to even the playing field.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor Nucor is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck, and cold-finished bars in the United States.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Thermo Fisher is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Thermo Fisher imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Thermo FisherThis maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies is expected to earn $23.37 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 0.6%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Thermo Fisher. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Thermo Fisher to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds. First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSE:FDL) is based on the 100 highest yielding stocks that have a history of consistently paying dividends and the ability to continue doing so in the future. The stocks in the Index are weighted based on the total dividends available to investors, and ESG criteria is not considered in the Index calculation. In a world with higher and unpredictable interest rates and inflation, it is likely that investors will seek more stability and return on investment, making dividend-paying stocks more attractive. As a result, the appeal of dividends may increase as investors move away from riskier investments. This shift toward a focus on dividends could be driven by the desire for a steady and reliable source of income, given the uncertain economic conditions. Value stocks are typically associated with established industries, and the focus is on current cash flow and dividends rather than capital growth. Consequently, dividends can play a significant role in driving returns for value stocks, often more so than capital gains.In mid-December, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Bloomberg TV that China reopening could lead to an influx in demand, which would raise the CPI globally and interest rates will continue to rise until inflation is controlled. This could be a bad indicator for stocks in 2023 too. He noted that while the US is experiencing a manufacturing recession, the service sector is going strong, which is different from the overall recessions faced in 2008 and 2020. Kleintop said that despite extreme volatility in 2022, high dividend paying stocks have been an effective strategy to protect investment portfolios, as they outperformed on the downside and in the fourth quarter. Even in a sector as battered as tech, the highest dividend payers are outperforming, and this trend has been observed in the United States, Asia, Canada, and Europe, as per Kleintop. He advised investors to follow the same dividend strategy to deal with a tumultuous 2023 as well. Story continuesSome of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). Our Methodology We scoured the holdings of First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSE:FDL) and selected the top 15 dividend stocks which were the most popular among Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Basically, we listed the best dividend leaders according to hedge funds. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 15 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainBest Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds15.

We are encouraged by these changes and think CAH’s underlying fundamentals and competitive advantages around preventative maintenance screenings and medication management will continue to improve. We believe valuations of healthcare companies like CAH that focus on cost optimization and promote technological efficiency across the supply chain will be rewarded over the long term.”14. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Dividend Yield as of February 3: 8.07% Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States.  The company predicts that its 2023 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $4.98 to $5.13, which indicates a growth rate of 3% to 6% based on the 2022 figure of $4.84. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) also authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to conclude by December 31, 2023.

(NYSE:MO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Altria (MO) shook off the prospects of a ban on menthol and a potential cap on nicotine and gained 20%. We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are available here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the market’s multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x – 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.”13. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Dividend Yield as of February 3: 5.03% 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a global technology company that operates through four business divisions – Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. It is one of the best dividend leaders to monitor. The Q4 2022 revenue of $8.1 billion exceeded Wall Street estimates by $10 million, but the non-GAAP EPS of $2.28 missed consensus by $0.11. The organic sales growth came in at 0.4% on a year-over-year basis. On January 26, Mizuho analyst Brett Linzey maintained a Neutral rating on 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $120 from $130. According to the analyst, 3M's fourth quarter results failed to meet expectations and the start of 2023 is expected to be weak. The analyst also mentioned that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is taking a cautious approach, working to balance their inventory levels and adjusting production to match demand in preparation for a potentially unstable 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) was part of 49 public stock portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 54 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 6.3 million shares worth $703 million. Mayar Capital mentioned 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.12. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Dividend Yield as of February 3: 11.71% Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company that explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas. On January 26, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) announced that Winter Storm Elliott impacted its expected fourth quarter production in the Permian Basin, and it now anticipates reporting an average output of 351 thousand barrels of oil per day and 662 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day for the fourth quarter, compared to the 355 thousand barrels of oil per day and 670 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day that would have been produced without the adverse weather conditions. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He is optimistic about Pioneer as he believes the company will enhance its capital efficiency by prioritizing higher-return projects in 2023. According to the analyst, this shift should refocus investors' attention on Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)’s robust cash return program, which is supported by ""one of the largest reserve bases in U.S. shale.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 49 hedge funds were bullish on Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. It is one of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”11. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Dividend Yield as of February 3: 8.35% Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was incorporated in 1971 and is headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It is an independent energy company that specializes in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. On January 10, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) announced that its fourth quarter production is expected to decline by 2%, or 15 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, as a result of the severe weather conditions that affected its operations in December, particularly in the Williston Basin. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. According to the analyst, Devon's recent acquisitions and existing resources support its aim of achieving annual production growth of up to 5%, but the neutral rating reflects the market's recognition of the stock's recent performance. According to hedge fund sentiment, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the best dividend leaders to invest in. In the third quarter of 2022, 51 hedge funds were long Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $642 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position.

The dividend is payable on February 13, to shareholders of record on February 6.

(NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assetsWe recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team.Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”6.

(NYSE:VZ) but lowered the price target on the shares to $49 from $55.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Timothy Welsh, sold US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$49.15). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of Timothy Welsh's holding.U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

In total, insiders sold US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes U.S. Bancorp Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$123m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At U.S. Bancorp Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought U.S. Bancorp stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walmart shares have more than proved their defensive attributes in the market turmoil that got underway a year ago. The stock is essentially flat over the past year (up +0.2%), which compares to the -7.3% decline for the Zacks Retail sector and -8% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in the last quarterly release. A robust third-quarter show encouraged management to raise its overall guidance for fiscal 2023.However, its consolidated operating income and earnings per share view still suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures.

Story continuesAlibaba’s solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively.The Zacks analyst expects that China commerce and international commerce to be up 11.2% and 7.2% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively. Further, strength across the local consumer services, Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well to the top-line growth.Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, public services and telecommunication industries are driving the cloud computing business. Our estimates suggest cloud revenues to witness a 6.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from the year-ago reported figure.(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-20.3% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing stiff competition is a concern. Besides, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers are an overhang on near-term profitability.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product.

If you want to see more best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.Value stocks are stocks of companies generally considered trading below what many investors think they are worth. Because different investors could view a stock differently, what a stock is worth is subjective. Some investors might view a stock as a value stock while others might find the same stock expensive.To find value stocks, we chose stocks that are included in the The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV).According to the ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) 'seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&amp;P® 500 Value Index (the “Index”).The S&amp;P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value segment in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price ratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.'Value stocks can decline as stocks can always trade for lower than what investors think they are worth. As a ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) declined as a whole last year and it could decline this year if economic data doesn't meet estimates.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. When companies have excess capital, many decide to return the excess capital through a stock buyback or by paying a dividend.When profits change, dividends can change. In good times, many companies increase their dividend when their profits increase. In more difficult times, many companies lower their dividends or suspend them altogether.In terms of the economy in 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of being a little stronger than some expected in terms of Q4 GDP. Inflation has also shown signs of potentially peaking last year.Story continuesIn terms of the effect of increased interest rates on inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on February 1, 2023, ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far.""Nevertheless, Powell also said, ""It would be very premature to declare victory, or to think that we’ve really got this.""If economic data doesn't meet estimates, stocks could always decline, including the best value stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy, we selected value stocks from the 407 holdings of the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) as of February 2, 2023.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they paid dividends and that they had considerable earnings growth potential in the next ten years if they maintained their market share.We then sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy13.

(NYSE:NKE) is one of the world's leading footwear, apparel, and accessories companies with a strong brand whose stock has rallied over 10% year to date as investors anticipate that the company could potentially do better in terms of its financial results in the future. The company also has a dividend yield of 1.05% as of 2/2.Polen Capital commented on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in a Q4 2022 investor letter,“Adobe and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

Berle Professor of Law and Director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School, joins Yahoo Finance Live to examine the impact of Ryan Cohen's stake taken in Nordstrom and the greater activist investor environment in early 2023.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: All right, Nordstrom rallied today after a report that activist investor Ryan Cohen took a big stake in the company. The retailer just the latest target of activist investors. It's grown broadly this year, caused largely by beaten down share prices. Names from Disney and Salesforce to Hasbro have been at the center of it all. For more on this, let's bring in Columbia Law School Professor John Coffee. Nice to see you, sir. So let's start with Mr. Ryan Cohen. What is he after here, and do you think he'll succeed?JOHN COFFEE: Well, his campaign is quite different than the others. When you look at Norman Peltz and Trian going after Disney or Salesforce being attacked by-- actually more than one-- Elliott Management and Star Value, those are the classic engagements. The distinctive feature about Mr. Ryan Cohen's attack is that he doesn't have the capital to take over Nordhaus. And the family of-- the Nordhaus family owns over 30% of the stock. That is an obstacle that means you can't just run over them and win a proxy fight.His strategy has to be to convince the Nordstrom family that he can save their company, that they have to work together. But so far, he's not indicated his strategy. All he's told us is he wants to get one director off the board, someone who used to be the CEO of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, which is now bankrupt, and put himself or his own candidate on the board. That's not a strategic move. That just tells you he's beginning to approach, but his strategy is not yet clear. The strategy is very clear when we talk about Peltz going after Disney or Salesforce being under attack.They also have had declining sale prices for a number of years. And they have major plans to sell off assets. For example, at Disney, there were some who want to spin off ESPN, which is very valuable. But it may be more valuable outside of Disney. This is different. It's distinctive. And we'll have to see how it plays out.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: John, what do you make of the uptick that we've seen in a number of activist investors getting involved with companies when it comes to Salesforce, Disney, now Nordstrom? Is that a trend that you also think is going to continue?JOHN COFFEE: Well, recognize that the common denominator here is a lot of these stocks fell and have fallen for years, partly as a result of the pandemic, partly as a result of other changes. But all retailers had problems with their supply chain. And most of the major media companies are still hung up over what to do with streaming or AI. And they don't have clear visions for the future that shareholders understand.DAVE BRIGGS: So why do you think, broadly speaking, this trend is spreading so fast? Is it just because how beaten down stocks were in '22?JOHN COFFEE: Well, low stock prices attract in activists. Activists don't go after the highest priced stocks. They can't get them up very quickly. They hope that if they announce a new campaign, they can get maybe a 5% or 6% jump just on the first day. And generally, the activists doesn't stay around for more than a year or a year and a half. They're looking for some kind of quick change that the market will put a positive value on.SEANA SMITH: So John, when it comes to Disney with Nelson Peltz, when it comes to Salesforce with Elliott Management, do you think those-- in those two situations, will we actually see change as a result of the activist investor pressure that we are currently seeing today?JOHN COFFEE: Well, they have a strategy. If they implement it, it probably will have some impact. That is the idea of spinning off ESPN is exactly the kind of major change that the management of a company doesn't want to give up on their prized asset. But it's also possible that their prized asset would be worth more outside of the conglomerate of Disney traded on its own. And that will be debated. I'm not going to tell you what to do with ESPN or what to do with Hulu, but those are major strategic questions that are under debate.SEANA SMITH: They certainly are under debate and a debate that we will continue to watch here. John Coffee, thanks so much.]"

We've got Nordstrom, Clorox, and Chipotle. My pick today, Nordstrom. And take a look at this stock, shares surging, up 24%. The move coming after activist investor Ryan Cohen took a stake in the company, is now reportedly pushing for changes. Those include a board shakeup and some cost cuts. Now, according to the Journal, Cohen is, once again, targeting Mark Tritton. He's the former CEO of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Tritton lost his top role at that company following pressure from Cohen.Now, in a statement to Yahoo Finance, Nordstrom said, quote, ""While Mr. Cohen hasn't sought any discussions with us in several years, we are open to hearing his views, as we do with all Nordstrom shareholders. We will continue to take actions that we believe are in the best interests of the company and our shareholders.""Well, analysts, they're weighing in on this. BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel writing that Cohen, quote, ""brings a spotlight that should not be ignored."" The team at Gordon Haskett saying, quote, ""a refresh at the board level is arguably long overdue."" And Jared, by the reaction in the stock today, it looks like the Street agrees.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, for the time being. I wonder when Ryan Cohen is going to start buying call options on JWN, the same way he did with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. By the way, he never really got on that Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond board, did he? He just kind of-- well, the stock went up, and he sold it near the top, almost exactly--DAVE BRIGGS: He manipulated it.JARED BLIKRE: I did-- did you say it? Anyway, it was all perfectly legal.

Xylem (XYL), which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This water and wastewater treatment company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19.85%.For the most recent quarter, Xylem was expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, but it reported $0.79 per share instead, representing a surprise of 19.70%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.55 per share, while it actually produced $0.66 per share, a surprise of 20%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Xylem lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Xylem has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 7, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

So with the pandemic firmly in the rearview mirror, or in this case, wake, is it time for the cruise industry to complete that slow turnaround? Citi leisure and travel analyst James Hardiman says this could be a banner year for the industry. Nice to see you, sir. Why do you say that?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I mean, I think if you think about the rest of the economy, certainly, the rest of the consumer space, everybody has moved on from the pandemic, arguably, years ago, right? It hasn't been nearly as easy for that crew space. And so I think there's a good argument to be made that there's still some pent-up demand here. There were about 50 million people that would have otherwise taken a cruise in 2020 and 2021 and ultimately didn't get to.Now some of those people have gotten back on in the year or so since.

This year's wave season, by all accounts from the work that we do, is off to a much better start. And by all accounts, it's off to a strong start. And so I think that sets the table to have a much more productive year.JARED BLIKRE: Let me ask you about going forward. Now we had over the pandemic, we had a number of habits and behaviors that change. I'm just wondering, for the average person who doesn't, let's say, go on a cruise very often, have they been able to penetrate, or are they relying on repeat customers? I'm just wondering what their TAM currently is versus the general population that may have some lingering misgivings about going on a cruise.Story continuesJAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, it's a fair point. I think it's a critical question. I do think it's safe to say that in the early reopening stages, it was overwhelmingly repeat customers, right? In addition to all of the angst surrounding the pandemic, not a whole lot of people that have never set foot on a cruise ship were willing to sort of add that extra anxiety. I think as we've gotten into late '22 and early '23, we are hearing about new cruisers getting back into the space, which I think is a critical component.You could argue, sort of based on my previous commentary, 50 million people that are sort of regular cruisers, that you don't necessarily need that new customer in the early going. But for this industry to get back to where it would like to get to, you need that new customer. I also think it's worth noting that only about 15 million Americans have ever been on a cruise, right? And so if you think about the TAM being certainly most Americans, they're just scratching the surface. And so it doesn't take a ton of new cruisers to grow that 15 million number pretty dramatically.SEANA SMITH: Well, James, just looking at the price of some of these stocks here since the start of the year, Royal Caribbean, I know you've got a buy rating on that. That stock up 38%, just since January 1. How much of this good news is already priced in? And if it's not, what's the upside potential for that?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I mean, it really depends on how you frame it, right? Since the beginning of the year, these stocks have been on a tear. If you compare it to 2019, right, for an overall market that's up 25%, 30%, Royal Caribbean is just half of what it was trading coming out of 2019. Now that is maybe not an apples to apples comparison because they have layered on a lot of that. But it just goes to show that this is an industry that's been left behind by the rest of the market. And so they have a long way to go playing catch-up here.DAVE BRIGGS: My assumption-- and it could be an incorrect one, James-- they often are-- is the typical cruise customer is just shopping around trying to get the best deal. But you have Royal Caribbean as a buy. So what is their competitive advantage against their competitors?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I mean, price is very important. So you're right from that perspective. But in a lot of instances, not as important as some other factors, most notably the itinerary, right? And Royal Caribbean is arguably the most glocal cruise brand. And I think that helps if you're trying to go to a remote destination, some of the most attractive destinations.I think they're a best bet, and I think they're a good combination of breadth of their offering and also perception of their brand. I would probably put them number one, those two factors combined. But yeah, I think there are a lot of factors. The newness of the ships, right? The features on the ships, and certainly, the destinations play a big role. And RCL is certainly no slouch in that perspective.JARED BLIKRE: James, we got to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights here. James Hardiman.]"

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, our CFO. Please go ahead, sir.James Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company, I wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head Of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter financial performance.Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond specific industrial and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted the full GAAP to non GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses.Story continuesOther than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments that described in our press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the December quarter were $2.169 billion, which was up 4.6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.1%, operating expenses were 20.6% and operating income was a record 47.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $863.7 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.56 and at the high-end of our guidance range.On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 67.8%, total operating expenses were $659.2 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $167.4 million, special charges of $6.5 million and $0.3 million of acquisition related and other costs and share-based compensation of $37.1 million. GAAP net income was a record $580.3 million, resulting at a $1.4 in earnings per diluted share. As compared to a year ago quarter, our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax expense recorded as a result of the capitalization of R&amp;D expenses for tax purposes. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 11.9% in the December quarter. We now expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be about 11% exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.A reminder of what we communicated over the past couple quarters. Our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax rate for a variety of factors including lower availability of tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credits, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&amp;D expenses for tax purposes. We're still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&amp;D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 300 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchips non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2022 was $1.165 billion. We had 152 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 13 days from the prior quarters level.We've increased our raw materials inventory to help protect our internal manufacturing supply lines. We are carrying higher work in progress to help maximize the utilization of constraint equipment, as well as to position ourselves to take advantage of new equipment installations, which should really bottlenecks. We are investing in building inventory for long lived high margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners. We need to take actions to help ensure that our supply lines can feed growth beyond what we expect in the March 2023 and June 2023 quarters and our reported days of inventory is a backward looking indicator. As gross margins rise, the effective days of inventory for the same physical inventory rises.And with every 100 basis points of gross margin growth it creates approximately three incremental days of inventory. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 22 days, which was up 3 days from the prior quarters level. Our cash flow from operating activities was a record $1.278 billion in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $385 million of long-term supply assurance receipts. We are going to adjust these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders as these payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $751.6 million and 34.6% of net sales in the December quarter.As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $288.9 million. We paid down $719.1 million of total debt in the December quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $701.2 million. Over the last 18 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $6.2 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record at $1.106 billion and 51% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.051 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.56 at December 31, 2022, down from 1.84 at September 30, 2022 and down from 2.58 at December 31, 2021.Capital expenditures were $141.3 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $525 million and $545 million, as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and ramp our manufacturing operations accordingly. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvements to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $55.3 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business and the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter.Ganesh?Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results were well above the midpoint of our revenue guidance marked by our disciplined execution as well as our resilient end markets. Net sales grew 4.6% sequentially and 23.4% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all time record are $2.17 billion. The December quarter also marked our ninth consecutive quarter of growth. Non-GAAP gross margins came in above the high-end of our guidance at a record 68.1%, up 38 basis points from the September quarter and up 202 basis points from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin also came in above the high-end of our guidance at a record 47.5%, up 62 basis points from the September quarter and up 283 basis points from the year ago quarter.Due to a rapid increase in net sales over the last 2 years, operating expenses at 20.65% were 185 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth, profitability and durability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was at the high-end of our guidance at a record $1.56 per share, up 30% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 51% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow at 34.6% of net sales for both very strong in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. As Eric mentioned, we have excluded $385 million of long-term supply assurance payments made by customers from our adjusted free cash flow calculation.Since these payments are refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. Net debt declined by $701.2 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 1.56x, exiting the December quarter. During the December quarter, we returned $409.8 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 60% of the prior quarters free cash flow. We expect to get below 1.5x net leverage by the end of the March quarter. And as Steve will share with you later, the Microchip Board has decided to increase the rate at which capital will be returned to shareholders starting in the June quarter. My heartfelt gratitude to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially to the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts and strong sense of ownership are what enabled us to navigate effectively in the midst of turbulent times.Taking a look at our net sales from a product line perspective, our microcontroller net sales were sequentially up 3.5% in the December quarter, and set another all time record. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter microcontroller net sales were up 25.6%. Microcontrollers represented 56.3% of our net sales in the December quarter. Our analog net sales were sequentially up 5.9% in the December quarter, and also set an all time record. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter analog net sales were up 21.2%. Analog represented 28% of our net sales on the December quarter. In the December quarter, our FPGA net sales also achieved a new record. While our overall business remains strong in the December quarter, the consumer appliance and market was weak as was our overall business in China.Our China business was initially impacted by COVID lockdowns and then subsequently impacted by the rapid transmission of COVID when lockdowns were lifted. Both actions adversely impacted our customers operations during the December quarter, resulting in inventory of many customers and distributors being higher than normal. In response to the weaker business environment in China, and a small but increasing number of other customers who have inventory and requested push outs, we took action in the December quarter to delay or redirect some shipments and plan to do more of the same in the March quarter. This is designed to reduce customer and channel inventory overbuilt, but will also increase the inventory on our balance sheet in the near-term.In the medium term, we expect this will give us a better chance to achieve a soft landing and position us well to respond to a stronger demand growth as the macro environment improves. As a result of the uncertain macro environment, and the multiple quarters with a backlog on our books, most of which is non cancelable, our bookings have slowed down as we expected. Given the circumstances we view the bookings slowdown as a positive which will serve to preserve the quality of new backlog that gets placed. Our unsupported backlog which represents backlog customers wanted shipped to them in the December quarter, but which we could not deliver in the December quarter remain well in excess of the actual net sales we achieved. Unsupported backlog did declined slightly for the first time in nine quarters.And we are continuing to work hard to further reduce our unsupported backlog, as well as our lead times to more manageable levels. While we have seen an increase in requests to push out or cancel backlog, these requests remain a small fraction of the very large backlog we have over multiple quarters, and hence they have not had a material effect on our business. Despite supply gradually improving, we expect to have supply constraints from much of 2023. However, in order to achieve a more healthy and sustainable business environment, we are driving to bring average lead times down to 26 weeks or less by the time we get to the second half of 2023. And we will be publishing a customer letter to this effect shortly. We believe there are three reasons why Microchip's business is demonstrating more resilience in the midst of the weakness seen by some other semiconductor companies.First, on the demand side, the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center and communications infrastructure end markets, which make up approximately 86% of our net sales remain solid. The consumer end market, which is about 14% of our net sales is experiencing some weakness, but it's dominated by home appliances which are comparatively more resilient. There are some signs that the data center end market could see some headwinds in 2023. Although our business remains strong, based on the market share gains we have had. And our overall demand remains quite durable, because of the end market mix we have consciously gravitated towards over the years. Second, on the supply side, a vast majority of our products are built on specialized technologies requiring trailing edge capacity.This is the capacity that has been most constrained over the last 2 years, which still remains constrained and where there was less opportunity to over ship to consumption. And last but not least, our laser focus on organic growth through total system solutions and higher growth mega trends for multiple years is giving us increased design momentum, farther share gains and a result in revenue tailwind. If you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15 plus years, you will observe a robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website has details of our performance through the business cycle. We remain cautiously optimistic about navigating to a soft landing for our business and expect our cash generation gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle.SemiconductorPhoto by Yogesh Phuyal on UnsplashLast quarter, we mentioned that Microchip was in the early stages of considering building a 300 millimeter U.S based fab for specialized trailing edge technologies. After a detailed analysis, we have concluded not to move forward with this project. And that our business objectives would likely be better achieved through our relationships with our foundry suppliers with lower execution risk, and a better return on invested capital. The CHIPS Act is already making a positive impact on our business through the investment tax credit, which started on January 1. And with impending capacity expansion grants that we will be seeking with several of our U.S semiconductor factories. We believe that CHIPS Act is good for the semiconductor industry and for America, as it enables critical investments, which will help even the global playing field while being strategically important for American economic and national security.Now, let's get into the guidance for the March quarter. Our backlog for the March quarter is strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, we are also taking active steps to help customers with inventory positions to selectively push out some of their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 1% and 4% sequentially. Further, we expect sequential net sales growth again in the June quarter. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 20.6%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.1% and 68.3% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.6% and 20.8% of sales.We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.3% and 47.7% of sales. And we expect a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.61 per share and $1.63 per share. At the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 20% despite a much higher tax rate than the year ago quarter. Finally, as you can see from our December quarter results and our March quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched 15 months ago, is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. Our Board of Directors and leadership team operate just as long-term owners of the business would thoughtfully making the key investments in people, technology, capacity, culture and sustainability required to thrive in the long-term.While being prudent, pragmatic and nimble about whatever short-term adjustments may be required. We are confident we will effectively navigate through whatever macro business challenges may unfold in 2023. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?Stephen Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter, while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA and all that in a continuing challenging supply environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to 35.8 cents per share. This is an increase of 41.5% from the year ago quarter.During the last quarter, we purchased $229.5 million of stock in the open market. We also paid out $180.3 million in dividends. Thus the total cash return was $409.8 million. This amount was 60% of our actual free cash flow of $682.9 million during the September 2022 quarter. Our pay down of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of December 2022 quarter to 1.56 from 1.84 at the end of September. Ever since we achieved an investment grade rating for a debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.867 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2022 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders.The adjusted free cash flow excludes $385 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when customer fulfill their purchase commitments. The adjusted free cash flow for December quarter was $751.6 million. We plan to return 62.5% or $469.8 million of that amount to our shareholders. The dividend expected to be approximately $196 million, and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $273.8 million. We also want to provide guidance for a planned cash return to shareholders beyond this quarter. We expect our net debt leverage at the end of March quarter to be less than 1.5. Therefore, our Board of Directors decided that beginning with the June quarter, we will accelerate the cash return to shareholders.We laid out a strategy for our cash return to shareholders at an analyst and investor day in November 2021. We began with returning 50% of the free cash flow of the prior quarter and increasing it by 2.5 percentage points every quarter. With these increases, we'll be returning 62.5% of last quarter's adjusted free cash flow to investors this quarter. Beginning in June quarter, we expect to double the rate at which we are increasing the percentage free cash flow return to shareholders. In other words, in June quarter, we expect to return 67.5% of our adjusted free cash flow from March quarter. Then in September quarter, we expect to return 72.5% of adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter. And so on, 5 percentage point increase every quarter.At this rate, we would approach 100% return of our adjusted free cash flow in about eight quarters. We realized that we're still getting a debt burden of $6.62 billion in a rising interest rate environment as some of our debt matures, we will likely be renewing it at a higher interest rate than we are currently paying on such debt. Our strategy of accelerating our cash return to shareholders over several quarters would help us pay down some additional debt and lower our debt service costs.

(NYSE:MET) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2, 2023Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings and Outlook Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2022 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter as well as our near term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&amp;A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&amp;A will promptly end at the top of the hour. With that, over to Michel.Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I look back on 2022, I am pleased with the relevance of our Next Horizon strategy and how it positioned us to absorb the challenges presented in the year and to succeed going forward. 2022 was a year still affected by COVID, and we incurred an impact of more than $650 million pretax. For the year, we saw pretax variable investment income come in 19% lower than our outlook expectation on lower returns in our private equity portfolio. And from a macroeconomic perspective, we felt pressure from rising inflation, a falling equity market and a stronger dollar. Yet despite these hurdles, MetLife performed. Our strategy proved its resilience and our consistent execution driven by discipline and determination paid off in 2022.Story continuesWe delivered an adjusted return on equity of 12.3% for the year, meeting our target for this important metric. We pushed ourselves, driven by our efficiency mindset and succeeded in posting a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. Our strong 2022 free cash flow generation enabled us to hit our 2 year free cash flow ratio target of 65% to 75%. This fueled the return of $4.9 billion of cash to our shareholders. And finally, we ended the year with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, arming us with ample financial flexibility. With our great set of market-leading businesses, good growth prospects around the world and the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow generation, I believe MetLife is very well positioned for the future.When we established our Next Horizon strategy at the end of 2019, we made several 5 year commitments against which we measure ourselves and, more importantly, hold ourselves accountable. I am pleased with our success to date in meeting those commitments. Even more, I am confident that we will beat each one. We committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Today, we are boosting our target adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This reflects, in part, our growth combined with our sustained discipline in pricing our products and in managing our capital. We said we would generate $20 billion over 5 years of free cash flow. We expect to exceed this target. We committed to freeing up an additional $1 billion over a 5 year period to invest in growth and innovation.Again, we are on track to overachieve against this target, and we are reaping the benefit of these investments. When we made these commitments, we did not expect U.S. interest rates to approach the lowest level in history, neither did we contemplate a global pandemic. While the environment may change, our accountability does not. We are also not content to maintain the status quo. We seek to challenge ourselves and push for more to raise the bar. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter 2022 results. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share, which compares to $1.8 billion or $2.17 per share a year ago. We generated strong underwriting results as COVID losses retreated further, while our recurring investment income continues to grow on higher new money rates.This was offset by variable investment income falling below our quarterly outlook expectation and a stronger dollar. Shifting to the full year 2022, the diversification of MetLife's portfolio of market-leading businesses once again proved its value. Most of our businesses and segments have returned to underlying levels of earnings equal to or greater than prior to the pandemic. Our U.S. Group Benefits business is a clear leader in this attractive segment of the life insurance industry. During the year, we grew our Group Benefits PFOs roughly 5% on top of double-digit growth the year prior. Our growth in Group Benefits represents more than $1 billion of new PFOs, bringing full year Group Benefit PFOs to approximately $23 billion. These numbers matter.First, we bring the broader set of products to our customers, life, dental, disability, vision, A&amp;H, legal and pet insurance among many others, more than any other carrier. Second, Group Benefits is a business where you have to make significant investments to keep up with evolving customer and employer expectations. Our scale enables us to make those investments, to add products and capabilities and to further digitize and enhance the customer experience. All of this adds up to drive the growth and persistency we've achieved in our Group Benefits business over the last several years as well as the growth we expect to achieve in the future. Moving to highlights from other segments and businesses. Our Retirement and Income Solutions business produced its strongest year of pension risk transfer volume in our history, more than $12 billion, including our largest ever single deal.Our Asia segment continued to generate strong sales growth, topping 11% on a constant currency basis in a market that remained in COVID's grip for much of the year. And our Latin America segment enjoyed both strong top and bottom line results, particularly in Mexico, as a heightened awareness of the importance of the products we offer, coupled with a flight to quality, drove sales up 26% on a constant currency basis, pushed persistency higher and added to adjusted earnings. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife is well capitalized and has plenty of liquidity, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our U.S. and international insurance businesses are self-funding. Our strong capital and liquidity position allows us to meet our commitments and obligations, but also equips us with the financial flexibility to seize attractive opportunities that may present an unsettled environment.We have built a clear track record in terms of how we deploy capital to its highest use. If we have opportunities to put capital to work organically or via mergers and acquisitions at appropriate risk-adjusted hurdle rates, we will do so. Case in point, we deployed approximately $3.8 billion of capital to support organic new business in 2022. Absent such opportunities, we will return capital to shareholders. In 2022, we paid to MetLife shareholders $1.6 billion of common stock dividends, and we repurchased $3.3 billion of common stock. In January, we purchased roughly an additional $250 million of common stock, and we have around $900 million remaining on our current authorization. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to recognize a true visionary in the history of MetLife.Harry Cayman, MetLife's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998, passed away on December 20 at the age of 89. Harry spent nearly his entire career at MetLife, starting as a junior attorney. As Chairman and CEO, Harry infused MetLife with a new corporate vision and an emphasis on profitable growth, something very much in line with our current focus on responsible growth. Harry's passing reminds us of the debt we owe at MetLife to those that went before us and building this great company since its founding in 1868. In closing, our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its resilience in a changing and shifting environment. Our total shareholder return of more than 19% in 2022 underscores the significant value we created for our shareholders against this backdrop.As we look ahead, our work is not done. We are raising the bar and setting our standards higher. As much as we have accomplished in recent years, I believe there is still much ahead for us to achieve. As the world has opened up, I was able to spend more time on the road than the last half of 2022 since the start of the pandemic. I'm more invigorated than ever to get out and meet face-to-face with our customers, our distribution partners, our employees and our shareholders. I look forward to updating some and introducing others to what we're building up MetLife, a company capable of being a quality compounder across a range of economic cycles. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in 4Q of '22 was $1.3 billion or $88 million higher than adjusted earnings. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by real estate sales, which were partially offset by losses on the fixed maturity portfolio due to normal trading activity in a rising rate environment. Credit losses in the portfolio remain modest. In addition, we had net derivative gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter.For the full year, net derivative losses accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher interest rates in 2022. Overall, our hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate and Other. Adjusted earnings in 4Q of '22 were $1.2 billion, down 28% and down 26% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while higher recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.55, down 23% year-over-year and down 21% on a constant currency basis.Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $400 million versus $20 million in 4Q of '21, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims, as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. Group Life mortality ratio was 87.6% in the fourth quarter of '22, in the middle of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69.4% in Q4 of '22, slightly below its annual target range of 70% to 75% and below the prior year quarter of 74.2%. The non-medical health ratio benefited from favorable disability severity, while dental was in line with expectations.Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were essentially flat year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q4 '21 versus Q4 of '22 resulted in year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 6 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 6% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. For the full year, Group Benefits adjusted PFO growth was 3%, while underlying growth, excluding excess premiums from participating contracts in 2021 versus 2022 was up 5% and within the 2022 target range of 4% to 6%.Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 40% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower variable investment income, mostly due to weaker private equity returns. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 96 basis points and 112 basis points excluding VII, up 21 basis points versus Q4 of '21 and up 11 basis points sequentially, primarily due to income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 23% in 2022. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products.In addition, we had a record sales quarter for structured settlements, demonstrating the strength of product diversification within RIS. With regards to PRT, we completed 6 transactions worth $12.2 billion in 2022, a record year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 63% and down 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. In addition, we had a write-down of a deferred tax asset in China as it was determined that the accumulated tax losses were unlikely to be utilized within the required 5 year statutory period. The write-down of the DTA reduced Asia's adjusted earnings in Q4 of 2022 by $34 million after tax and was accounted for in net investment income due to the equity method of accounting treatment for our China joint venture.While Asia's underwriting was modestly unfavorable versus Q4 of '21, we saw a significant sequential improvement due to lower COVID claims in Japan. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. And sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by FX annuities sold through face-to-face channels in Japan. For the full year, Asia sales were up 11%, exceeding its 2022 guidance of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $181 million, up 45% and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year.In addition, the Chilean encaje, which had a positive 6% return in 4Q '22 versus 4% in the prior year and higher recurring interest margins, were positive contributors. These two favorable items were partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. LatAm's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs are up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 67% and up 112% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting versus Q4 of '21, which had elevated COVID-19-related claims, particularly in the U.K. This was partially offset by less favorable expenses year-over-year.EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $208 million, down 57%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. In addition, less favorable expense margins and adverse equity market performance also reduced adjusted earnings year-over-year. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $219 million versus an adjusted loss of $177 million in the prior year, which excludes favorable notable tax items of $140 million. Higher taxes and lower net investment income were partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the settlement of an IRS audit.Excluding these favorable items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 22%, within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2022. VII was $24 million in the fourth quarter. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the bulk of the VII asset balances, had a negative 0.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. For the full year, VII was $1.5 billion, below our 2022 target range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our private equity portfolio had a positive 7% return in 2022, a solid performance in comparison to the public equity markets with the S&amp;P 500 down 19%.While VII underperformed in 4Q '22, our new money rate increased to 5.66%, which was 150 basis points above our roll-off yield of 4.16%. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2022. On a full year basis, you will note RIS MetLife Holdings in Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income, consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these three businesses. Turning to Page 7. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2021 and 2022. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '22 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in Group Benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs and timing of certain projects.That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2022, our direct expense ratio was 12.2%, below our annual target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.2 billion at September 30 and remained above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.For the 2 year period, 2021 to 2022, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 68% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2022 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2022 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $2.6 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3% sequentially, primarily due to derivative losses and dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings and investment gains. Finally, while our Japan solvency margin ratio dipped below 500% as of September 30, we expect the Japan SMR to be approximately 700% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.As we have discussed on prior calls, our Japan business as well as MetLife overall does better economically in a higher interest rate environment. However, given the asymmetrical nature of how the SMR is calculated, the ratio declines in a rising rate environment as assets are mark-to-market, but not the corresponding liabilities. As a result, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction in December with our Bermuda entity, which has an economic-based solvency regime. This transaction improved the Japan SMR ratio by approximately 250 percentage points. Before I shift to our near-term outlook, starting on Page 9, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 15 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2017 through 2021.This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '22 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, Pages 16 through 19 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 9, our 2023 to 2025 outlook reflects the impacts of the new accounting requirements of long-duration targeted improvement or LDTI. While 2022 actually used for growth rate calculations remain as previously reported on a pre-LDTI basis. In mid-April or roughly two to three weeks prior to the reporting of our 1Q '23 earnings, we plan to provide you with a recasted QFS based on LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022. While there would be certain positive and negative effects depending on product and segment, we do not expect the underlying run rate of adjusted earnings for the firm overall to change materially.Now let's turn to Page 10 for further details on our near-term outlook. We assume COVID-19 to be endemic, consistent with the recent trends that we have been experiencing. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and a potential recession in 2023. Based on the 12/31/22 forward curve, we expect interest rates to rise in 2023. Finally, for purposes of the near-term outlook, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&amp;P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our long-term historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets. We are increasing our adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This increase of 100 basis points from our prior 12% to 14% ROE range is a function of the growing impact of our mix of business and higher new business returns over the last several years as well as the impact of LDTI.Pixabay/Public DomainWe expect to maintain our 2 year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items. Our direct expense ratio guidance for 2023 is being recalibrated to reflect LDTI by approximately 30 basis points to 12.6%. This captures an approximate $1 billion reduction in adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs, due to the change in accounting. This is primarily related to certain annuity contracts within RIS as well as shifting certain variable annuity fees to market risk benefits, which are reported outside adjusted earnings. Since this change in accounting to LDTI will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of 2021, our previously reported direct expense ratios will likewise be recalibrated to put 2021 and 2022 on the same basis as 2023 and beyond.Our VII for 2023 is expected to be approximately $2 billion after applying our historical average returns on asset balances. I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate and Other adjusted loss target is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax in 2023. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 1 point to 22% to 24% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. On Page 11, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $14.7 billion in 2021 to $19 billion expected in 2023.Private equities will continue to hold the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE annual return of 12%, we expect an annual 7% return for real estate and other funds. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now I will discuss our near term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 12. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $750 million in 2022, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%.We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. Keep in mind, these are annual ratios and are typically higher in the first quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health given the seasonality of the business. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. We are increasing the range of our expected annual RIS investment spread by 40 basis points to 135 to 160 basis points in 2023. The majority of this increase is driven by continued expectations of rising interest rates on the short end of the curve and the resulting benefit of interest rate cap income, which we expect to peak in the first half of 2023.In addition, LDTI will contribute approximately 10 basis points to the investment spread calculation while not increasing adjusted earnings. Upon transition to LDTI, the unlocking of future cash flow assumptions to current best estimate increased our deferred profit liability, which is amortized into earnings and will now be included in the spread calculation, reducing other sources of earnings. Overall, the conversion to LDTI will not significantly change RIS run rate adjusted earnings. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline 12% to 14% in 2023, driven by the normal runoff of the business, market declines and the transition to LDTI. Beyond 2023, we expect annual PFOs to decline 6% to 8%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio target to 40% to 45% in 2023 from the prior 45% to 50% target to reflect the impact of lowering policyholder dividend levels.Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2023. Now let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 13. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia's adjusted earnings, excluding $270 million of COVID-19 claims in 2022, to grow at mid-single digits over the near term. For Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by low double digits over the near term. We expect our adjusted earnings to grow high single digits over the near term, excluding roughly $80 million due to favorable market-related factors in 2022.Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. We expect EMEA run rate adjusted earnings to be roughly $55 million per quarter in 2023, reflecting the impact of currency headwinds and then grow by high single digits in 2024 and 2025. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a good quarter to close out another strong year, reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery.Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and Salesforce, Inc. (CRM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walmart shares have more than proved their defensive attributes in the market turmoil that got underway a year ago. The stock is essentially flat over the past year (up +0.2%), which compares to the -7.3% decline for the Zacks Retail sector and -8% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in the last quarterly release. A robust third-quarter show encouraged management to raise its overall guidance for fiscal 2023.However, its consolidated operating income and earnings per share view still suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost inflation, and expects it to remain elevated.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Alibaba have over the last couple of months, reflecting the company's leverage to expectations of a consumer spending rebound in the wake of China ending its zero-Covid policies and associated restrictions.

Story continuesAlibaba’s solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively.The Zacks analyst expects that China commerce and international commerce to be up 11.2% and 7.2% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively. Further, strength across the local consumer services, Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well to the top-line growth.Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, public services and telecommunication industries are driving the cloud computing business. Our estimates suggest cloud revenues to witness a 6.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from the year-ago reported figure.(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-20.3% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing stiff competition is a concern. Besides, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers are an overhang on near-term profitability.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc.

If you want to read about some more hot insurance stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Hot Insurance Stocks To Buy Now.The insurance industry had a challenging year in 2022, with the COVID-19 pandemic leading to an increase in claims for areas such as business interruption and pandemic insurance. Even before 2020, the insurance sector was facing challenges. These challenges then became even more pressing in the year 2022. The 2nd largest insurance company, Ping An Insurance (China), was valued at around $140 billion by the end of 2022, and the price of its stock fell by –6.74% which is quite good compared to the rest of the market. The total insurance industry was worth $1.4 trillion at end of 2022.In 2023, the insurance industry is expected to recover, with a focus on digital transformation and the use of data and analytics. A report by PwC predicts that the insurance industry will invest heavily in technology in 2023. The proliferation of digital platforms, the expansion of distribution channels through strategic alliances and integration options, and the improvement of data analysis are bringing markets together. The availability of regulatory choices will continue to increase and obstacles to market entry will become less of an issue.According to McKinsey, the 2023 outlook remains favorable as a growing number of individuals are recognizing their personal responsibility for their health and retirement expenses. As government debt in developed economies rises and funding shortfalls occur in public health and retirement programs (e.g. Social Security in the US and National Pension System in Japan), a $41 trillion shortfall in global pensions has emerged. Despite this challenge, the industry presents opportunities for insurance providers.Overall, the systemic risk within the insurance industry remains at a moderate level in 2023. However, there is a growing upward trend in the total systemic risk assessments of insurance companies, largely due to elevated exposures to assets that are illiquid, hard to determine in value, and involve over-the-counter derivatives, short-term funding, and intra-financial assets. In 2021, the solvency and financial performance of insurers improved due to favorable conditions in financial markets. However, since 2022, rising geopolitical tensions, inflation, stricter monetary policies, and a deteriorating economic outlook have led to a rise in market, credit, and liquidity risks.Story continuesAccording to experts, Blockchain can benefit insurance companies through cost savings, improved efficiency, increased transparency, and better product and market development. Blockchain enables the real-time sharing of data among parties in a secure and verifiable manner and can also facilitate new insurance practices. The adoption of blockchain represents an opportunity for positive change and growth in the competitive insurance industry. Some of the top insurance stocks to monitor in this context include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET).It’s not surprising that AI can bring about change in the insurance industry as well. According to Forbes, AI will play a major role in transforming the insurance industry. As AI becomes more popular, it is becoming an increasingly important tool for companies in the sector. The use of AI can help companies analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, allowing them to make more informed decisions. The integration of technology, data, AI, and modern design has created a formidable force that is transforming the traditionally policy-focused industry into one that prioritizes the customer experience.Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify insurance stocks that have gained at least 15% year to date in 2023. From this resultant dataset we picked the stocks with highest share price gains.

(NYSE:MET) For Its Next Dividend Without Doing These Checks",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-buy-metlife-inc-nyse-141714966.html,1675433834,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PE']","[MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 2 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase MetLife's shares before the 6th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.50 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.00 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, MetLife has a trailing yield of approximately 2.9% on its current stock price of $69.71. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for MetLife Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. MetLife is paying out an acceptable 72% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's not ideal to see MetLife's earnings per share have been shrinking at 2.2% a year over the previous five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, MetLife has lifted its dividend by approximately 10% a year on average. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever.Story continuesTo Sum It UpIs MetLife worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have been declining and the company is paying out more than half its profits to shareholders; not an enticing combination. This is not an overtly appealing combination of characteristics, and we're just not that interested in this company's dividend.With that being said, if you're still considering MetLife as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. For example, MetLife has 3 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

He expects the new sanctions will play out in a similar way that the EU's crude oil ban has, meaning Russian volumes will not see a meaningful dip as exports are rerouted from Europe to other countries.""Everything we have seen over the last year tells us not to underestimate that Russia hasn't got this figured out,"" Smith said.Meanwhile, a price cap on Russian fuels will also be imposed. Similar to the crude oil price cap, the EU and G7 plan to bar other countries from accessing insurance and shipping services unless they abide by a cap on refined products.But Smith expects the new price cap to be a moot point, as it will likely be too high to be relevant. There are also too many different products with different prices to justify any single price cap, which will make it harder to implement than previous ceilings.Story continuesIn addition to diesel, Russia produces a range of other refined products, including jet fuel and fuel oil, requiring separate price caps for each.Regardless of the price cap, buyers of Russian fuels will likely see discounts when the ban takes effect, Smith predicted.Discounted oil prices have allowed Russia to maintain strong seaborne crude exports even after the December embargo. While Moscow's energy revenue has fallen, the key point is that neither Russian production nor exports have crashed, Smith noted.""You have countries, such as India, that's able to purchase Russian crude at a significant discount, and so they do it,"" he said. ""We've seen a number of EU countries taking crude and diesel from Russia over the last year because of the economics, rather than self-sanctioning. Pricing has driven the energy situation with Russia.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Omnicom Group is:38% = US$1.4b ÷ US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.38.Does Omnicom Group Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Omnicom Group has a superior ROE than the average (12%) in the Media industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Omnicom Group's Debt And Its 38% Return On EquityOmnicom Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.50. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

49,95a587c1-3262-3a25-94b9-3149cb33c297,FE,2023-02-04,FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.39,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-nyse-fe-affirmed-dividend-162305878.html,1675441385,STORY,['FE'],"[FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.39 per share on the 1st of March. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 3.8%, which is around the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, FirstEnergy's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 1,129% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 29.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 57% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.20 total annually to $1.56. This works out to be a decline of approximately 3.4% per year over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. It's encouraging to see that FirstEnergy has been growing its earnings per share at 56% a year over the past five years. EPS is growing rapidly, although the company is also paying out a large portion of its profits as dividends. If earnings keep growing, the dividend may be sustainable, but generally we'd prefer to see a fast growing company reinvest in further growth.Our Thoughts On FirstEnergy's DividendOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While FirstEnergy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, FirstEnergy has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and Salesforce, Inc. (CRM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walmart shares have more than proved their defensive attributes in the market turmoil that got underway a year ago. The stock is essentially flat over the past year (up +0.2%), which compares to the -7.3% decline for the Zacks Retail sector and -8% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in the last quarterly release. A robust third-quarter show encouraged management to raise its overall guidance for fiscal 2023.However, its consolidated operating income and earnings per share view still suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost inflation, and expects it to remain elevated.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Alibaba have over the last couple of months, reflecting the company's leverage to expectations of a consumer spending rebound in the wake of China ending its zero-Covid policies and associated restrictions. The stock is still down over the past year, but it is up an impressive +52% over the last three months compared to the +17.5% gain for the Zacks Retail sector and +11.2% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index. Story continuesAlibaba’s solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively.The Zacks analyst expects that China commerce and international commerce to be up 11.2% and 7.2% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively. Further, strength across the local consumer services, Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well to the top-line growth.Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, public services and telecommunication industries are driving the cloud computing business. Our estimates suggest cloud revenues to witness a 6.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from the year-ago reported figure.(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-20.3% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing stiff competition is a concern. Besides, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers are an overhang on near-term profitability.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pinned at 98 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 12.5%.Q3 PerformanceSealed Air’s third-quarter 2022 earnings increased year over year, while sales remained flat. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, whereas revenues missed the same. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.7%, on average.Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSealed Air Corporation price-eps-surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sealed Air this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Sealed Air has an Earnings ESP of -1.13%. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Factors to NoteSealed Air witnessed a 7% year-over-year overall volume decline in the third quarter of 2022. This was mainly due to muted customer spending amid the ongoing inflationary pressure. This trend is expected to have continued through the fourth quarter and its impacts are likely to get reflected in the company’s results in the quarter.However, the company’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have gained from the sustained demand for packaging of food, beverage and healthcare products, and e-commerce activities. Around 63% of the company’s revenues are generated from the packaging of protein, foods, fluids and goods for the medical and life-sciences industries, while e-commerce sales contribute nearly 11%.In December 2018, Sealed Air had set forth a reformation plan called Reinvent SEE Strategy, along with a fresh restructuring program to boost growth and earnings. The strategy is focused on innovations, SG&amp;A productivity, product-cost efficiency, channel optimization and customer service enhancements. The capabilities, operational disciplines and governance processes established through the Reinvent SEE business transformation are embedded in the company’s ongoing productivity improvement system, SEE Operating Engine.Savings from these initiatives have been aiding the company in delivering sales growth and productivity gains and mitigating supply-chain challenges. This is expected to have driven the operating margin performance in the December-ended quarter.However, SEE has been encountering supply-chain disruptions, higher raw material costs and elevated freight costs associated with the sourcing and movement of raw materials due to overall tight market conditions. These factors are likely to have impacted its margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has been increasing its R&amp;D investments in innovation and automation, which are anticipated to have weighed on its margins.Story continuesSegment EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Food segment’s fourth-quarter net sales is pegged at $883 million, suggesting growth of 0.7% from the prior-year period’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stands at $197 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 3.4%. Lower volumes, owing to food retail market declines across the Americas and EMEA regions, and the adverse impacts of prior supply disruptions are expected to have hurt its performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Protective Packaging segment’s fourth-quarter net sales is pegged at $574 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted EBITDA is pinned at $107 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 15%.The segment’s medical and life sciences portfolio has been gaining from strong demand for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment, coupled with higher demand for temperature assurance packaging solutions. However, lower volume, driven by recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets, and unfavorable currency translation are likely to have offset these tailwinds.Price PerformanceIn the past year, shares of Sealed Air have declined 15.8% against the industry’s growth of 2.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some Industrial Products stocks, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Allegion plc ALLE has an Earnings ESP of +4.19% and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

56,f4e7b980-de6c-3038-a7ca-7a5e2a51a7d0,RL,2023-02-04,Why Ralph Lauren (RL) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ralph-lauren-rl-poised-171005443.html,1675444205,STORY,['RL'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Ralph Lauren (RL), which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry.This upscale clothing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8%.For the last reported quarter, Ralph Lauren came out with earnings of $2.23 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 6.70%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.88 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.30%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Ralph Lauren, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ralph Lauren has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 9, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

QuoteTotal revenues grew 0.4% to $275.5 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $273 million. Excluding currency impacts, revenues jumped 1.8%.

While the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line surpassed the same on the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario. However, shares declined sharply post earnings release owing to a soft outlook due to market uncertainty and high channel inventory levels.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter declined to $2,235 million or $1.98 per share from $3,399 million or $2.98 per share in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line contraction.Quarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $2,684 million or $2.37 per share compared with $3,686 million or $3.23 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseQUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseQUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteRevenuesOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $9,463 million compared with $10,705 million in the prior-year quarter. Despite solid automotive and IoT revenues, the top line decreased on soft demand patterns and elevated inventory levels owing to market uncertainty and macroeconomic woes. However, Qualcomm witnessed strong momentum in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial sectors, along with strength in Snapdragon portfolio within the automotive sector.Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $9,456 million compared with $10,697 million in the year-earlier quarter. The figure missed the consensus mark of $9,563 million.Segment ResultsQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) declined 11% year over year to $7,892 million, as strength in adjacent platforms beyond mobile (automotive and IoT) was more than offset by lower demand in handsets. The company is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets.Automotive and IoT revenues rose 58% and 7%, respectively, to $456 million and $1,682 million, while handset revenues were down 18% to $5,754 million. EBT margin decreased to 28% from 35%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,524 million, down 16% year over year due to lower licensing revenues. EBT margin declined to 73% from 77%.Story continuesCash Flow &amp; LiquidityQualcomm generated $3,095 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal first quarter compared with $2,057 million a year ago. At quarter-end, the company had $4,808 million in cash and cash equivalents and $15,431 million of long-term debt. The company repurchased 11 million shares for $1.3 billion during the quarter.Q2 GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $8.7-$9.5 billion due to rapid deterioration in demand and high channel inventory. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $2.05-$2.25 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $1.53-$1.73 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.25 billion and $1.45 billion.

It hit 1 million users in as little as five days and this week was declared the fastest-growing app in history, growing more quickly than social media mainstays including Instagram and TikTok.OpenAI, the company that created the advanced chatbot, has become similarly high-profile, attracting a $10 billion investment from Microsoft last month that put it on track for a $29 billion valuation. With the sky seemingly the limit for ChatGPT and its potential applications, Sam Altman, the Stanford dropout who cofounded OpenAI in 2015, says the advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI) ChatGPT eventually aspires to be is still in its infancy. And if things go the right way for OpenAI, it could even upend the economic model Altman was rebelling against when he first started the company.“I think that if AGI really truly fully happens, I can imagine all these ways that it breaks capitalism,” Altman said in an interview with Forbes published Friday.When Altman cofounded OpenAI, he and a group of early investors including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel set out to counter Google’s growing hegemony in the artificial intelligence space. Google had just completed its $500 million acquisition of DeepMind, the London-based A.I. startup that two years ago achieved a major breakthrough by cataloging almost every known protein in the human body.Opposing the notion that a single tech giant could monopolize A.I. research for years to come, Altman says that OpenAI’s mission was the opposite: Democratize artificial intelligence and distribute its benefits as evenly as possible by continuously sharing with the world the company’s work, research, and even its patents.“Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact,” the company announced in a 2015 statement at launch.Story continuesWhen Microsoft confirmed it was extending its partnership with OpenAI last month, CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement that the two companies share an ambition to “democratize A.I. as a new technology platform.”But skeptics can’t help but notice OpenAI is beginning to behave a lot less anticapitalist than it used to now that its financial fate is intertwined with Microsoft, which is virtually in charge of the A.I. startup until OpenAI is able to pay back the tech giant’s initial investment plus interest. The internal conflict over OpenAI’s identity in the months and years to come is central to Fortune magazine’s latest cover story by Jeremy Kahn with reporting by Michal Lev-Ram and Jessica Mathews. Khan spoke with several former employees at OpenAI who left the company because of “cultural and strategic shifts,” including a reduced emphasis on democratizing A.I.OpenAI announced this week it would trial a monthly subscription plan for ChatGPT, while Altman wrote on Twitter in December that he would “have to monetize it somehow at some point.”In his interview with Forbes, Altman said he still believes OpenAI can balance between its goal of democratization and its new moneymaking interests. “I think capitalism is awesome. I love capitalism,” he said, adding that while he sees capitalism as the best economic model out of a bad bunch, he still hopes “we find a way better one.”He reiterated the idea that no single company should own artificial intelligence and hoard its benefits, and added that he is doing everything he can for OpenAI to avoid becoming that.“We've tried to design a structure that is, as far as I know, unlike any other corporate structure out there,” he said. “If we really, truly get AGI and it breaks, we'll need something different [in company structure].”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

What’s worse, iPhone sales, which make up more than half of Apple’s total revenue, declined 8% year-over-year to $65.7 billion.For any other company, those results would have been a disaster. Just look at Amazon (AMZN), which reported a full-year net loss of $2.7 billion. As of Friday, shares of the e-commerce giant were off more than 4%. Microsoft (MSFT)? After announcing slowing cloud growth last week, its shares were down about 1%. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, were off more than 1% after the company reported declining ad sales.You’d think Apple would face the same kind of reckoning on Wall Street as its peers. But as of noon Friday, shares of the iPhone maker were up more than 3%. The reason? Apple’s report wasn’t as bad as it could have been. In fact, despite a decline in iPhone, Mac, and Wearables revenue, there was good news as well.The standout from the report was that Apple’s install base now comprises a whopping 2 billion devices. The iPhone install base in particular is at an all-time high, and saw double-digit growth in emerging markets, with CFO Luca Maestri specifically calling out both Mexico and India during the company’s earnings call. And that, he said, helped push the company’s Services revenue to a record of $20.8 billion.Apple CEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 14 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 7, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaWhat’s more, Apple said the number of paid subscribers for its various services topped out at 935 million users. That’s 150 million more than the company had a year ago and four times as many as it recorded five years ago.Apple has been pushing its services growth for years as a means to help offset its dependence on iPhone sales, and with the business now raking in $20.7 billion in Q1, it’s the company’s second largest money maker behind the iPhone.“Both paid and transacting accounts grew double-digits [year-over-year]...which tells us that Apple continues to penetrate the installed base and increase monetization,” BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note following Apple’s report.Story continuesAs Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring pointed out in his own investor note, Apple’s ecosystem growth means that there is still “meaningful room to increase spend per user.”Apple’s gross margins are also expected to come in between 43.5% and 44.5% in the coming quarter, something that Wedbush’s Dan Ives says is a result of Apple’s push to bring more of its device components, including its chip development, in house.What’s more, Apple CEO Tim Cook says that iPhone production is back to normal following worker protests over COVID lockdowns at a Foxconn plant in China in November and December. That should address at least some of the decline in iPhone sales moving forward.There still could be trouble aheadThat’s not to say that the story out of Cupertino is sunshine and rainbows. Apple is still a company that lives and dies on the spending habits of consumers, and with consumer confidence low, Mohan says there is concern about end market demand for Apple’s products.The decline in iPhone sales wasn’t just a supply problem, either. According to IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, smartphone shipments declined 18% in Q4, on slowing demand for phones as consumers pull back on spending following the boom companies saw during the pandemic.What’s more, Apple is forecasting that Mac and iPad sales will decline double digits in the coming quarter. And that’s after Apple released new MacBook Pros and Mac minis with the company’s latest M2 Pro and M2 Max chips. New computers would normally drive sales growth, but it looks like they simply can’t match the same increases Apple saw last year.Still, unlike its other Big Tech cohorts, Apple’s business has seemingly remained resilient enough to keep it from having to lay off any of its employees.

MSFT stock went on to get a favorable reception. Alphabet beat, but didn’t benefit as a result.Meta also beat on EPS and revenue, but we all know that the ‘loud cheers’ for its report weren’t a result of the positive EPS and revenue surprises.What seems to be front and center for the market appears to be expense trends and guidance. The market is well aware of the challenging macro backdrop and expected these results to validate the evolving macroeconomic environmentThis came through in the Microsoft report that kick-started the Q4 reporting cycle for the group showing decelerating cloud trends and serious challenges on the PC front. The cloud growth at Amazon and Alphabet reconfirmed the trends established by Microsoft.By far the biggest differentiator among these mega-cap players appears to be the market’s perception of expense control. This was the market’s biggest worry with Meta and they seem to have done an excellent job of revising the narrative in their favor. Alphabet and Amazon made the right noises on that front, but the market doesn’t seem to be convinced that they are doing all they can to get on top of the issue.For example, Alphabet has already announced lay-offs and noted on the call that they are slowing the pace of hirings, but they ended up exiting 2022 Q4 with a net addition to payrolls. Apple, on the other hand, seems to have a lot of credibility on this count, with the company’s gross margin outlook for the current period (2023 Q1) confirming that view.   Story continuesAs noted before, it is clear now that none of these players’ profitability is Teflon coated and immune from cyclical forces. Apple may be getting a pass on its quarterly report, with one-off factors like China’s Covid restrictions that have since been lifted and FX headwinds causing most of the shortfalls. But the consumer decision to purchase the company’s pricey phones and other devices will also always remain a discretionary choice and vulnerable to economic forces.Looking at the ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ as a whole, Q4 earnings in the aggregate are down -28% from the same period last year on +1.4% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth is expected to resume next year, as you can see in the chart below that shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis. For 2023, the group is expected to bring in +3.8% higher earnings on +6% higher revenues.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for the group have been steadily coming down, with the Q4 results and associated guidance adding to the trend. The aggregate 2023 earnings estimate for the group has come down by -8.5% over the last three months, with the current full-year 2023 earnings growth estimate of +3.8% down from +11.8% over the period.Market participants see the big challenge for the group to be centered around margin pressures, a function of their still-heavy payrolls, particularly for Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. One could say that if they move into the management mode of other blue chip operators by getting on top of their expenses, they can help strengthen their profitability.In addition to the group’s margin challenge, there are two key factors that will drive their profitability over the next two years.The first factor is the unusual impact of Covid on their profitability in the last two years. You can see some of that from the 2021 growth figures in the above chart. The chart below shows the aggregate dollar earnings for the group in the last 6 years and estimates for the next two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe have highlighted above the two years that benefited from the Covid effects. The question now is whether the +58% jump in 2021 earnings brought forward profits from 2022 and 2023 only, or will the issue be with us in 2024 as well?The second factor is related to the impact of macroeconomic forces on these companies’ profitability. Microsoft’s business was affected not only by the slump in PC demand, a function of post-Covid adjustment, but also by growth deceleration in the cloud business. We are seeing similar cloud-centric challenges in the Amazon and Alphabet reports as well.This cloud deceleration is a direct result of companies cutting back on the so-called enterprise spending, on top of digital advertising spending. The market was earlier under the impression that cloud spending was effectively immune from economic forces and will not experience any cuts. The numbers from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet show otherwise.This brings us back to evaluating the seemingly Teflon-coated status of Apple’s gadgets and services.I am of the opinion that once the Fed’s tighter policy regime produces cracks in the labor market, we will end up discovering that consumers rationally deferred replacing their older devices with newer ones. We are not there yet because the labor market is rock solid, but we could very well reach that stage at either of the coming two quarterly reports.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 3rd, we now have Q4 results from 251 S&amp;P 500 members or 50.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these 251 index members are down -7.5% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.With 96 index members on deck to report Q4 results this week, we will have seen results from more than 69% of all the index members by the end of the week.The comparison charts below put the EPS and revenue beats percentages in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q4 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With results from more than 28% of S&amp;P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q4 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.The Earnings Big PictureThe chart below shows the expected 2022 Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectation in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, as we have been flagging for some time now.

The caricatures were part of a media campaign that Charlie Hebdo said was intended to support anti-government protests in the Islamic nation.Representatives for the Iranian and French governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A press officer for Charlie Hebdo said the magazine had no comment on the matter ""for the moment.""Iran publicly vowed an ""effective response"" to the ""insulting"" cartoons, and summoned the French envoy in Tehran, while also ending activities of the French Institute of Research in Iran and saying it was re-evaluating France's cultural activities in the country.The hack-and-leak targeting Charlie Hebdo was part of a wider digital influence operation with techniques matching previously identified activity linked to Iranian state-backed hacking teams, Microsoft researchers said in a report. The group responsible is the same one that U.S. Department of Justice officials earlier identified as having conducted a ""multi-faceted campaign"" to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Microsoft said. Iran denied the claims at the time.Amid Iran's criticism of the Khamenei cartoons, a group of hackers calling itself ""Holy Souls"" posted on an online forum that they had access to the names and contact details of more than 200,000 Charlie Hebdo subscribers. In their post, they said they would sell the information for 20 bitcoins ($470,000).A sample of the leaked data was later released and verified as authentic by the French newspaper Le Monde.Story continues""This information, obtained by the Iranian actor, could put the magazine's subscribers at risk for online or physical targeting by extremist organizations,"" the Microsoft researchers said.To amplify their operation, the Iranian hackers used Twitter accounts with fake or stolen identities to criticize the Khamenei cartoons. Two accounts impersonating a Charlie Hebdo editor and a technology executive also posted the leaked data before Twitter banned them, Microsoft said.Twitter’s press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco; Editing by Daniel Wallis)]"

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Starbucks' shares before the 9th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of February.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.53 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.12 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Starbucks has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current stock price of $104.3. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Starbucks's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Starbucks Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Starbucks is paying out an acceptable 70% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Starbucks generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (89%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's positive to see that Starbucks's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Starbucks, with earnings per share up 7.5% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Starbucks has delivered an average of 20% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Starbucks? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.However if you're still interested in Starbucks as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Starbucks. To that end, you should learn about the 5 warning signs we've spotted with Starbucks (including 2 which shouldn't be ignored).If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

A spokesperson did not respond to confirm the latest year-over-year price increase, but as of Q4 2022 prices at the chain were up 5% on a 12-month period.Overall, North America same-store sales increased by 10% as well, driven by a 9% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in comparable transactions. The increase in the average ticket is ""related to pricing is analyzation from pricing moves we took last year,"" she said.""Our pricing was taken largely in line with our inflationary pressures, so this year, the ticket is benefiting from the analyzation of that when we caught that,"" Ruggeri added.It appears that higher prices are here to stay for the interim future with relief expected in the back half of the year.""In the back half of the year, we'll start to see pricing return more towards historical levels and so we'll see a moderation of our ticket and an increase to our overall transaction,"" she said.Starbucks reaffirmed its full-year guidance of 7%-9% of U.S. same-store sales with expectations to see more of a balance between the ticket size and transaction.Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said prices are rising at a slower pace during his latest press conference.

However, both top and bottom lines increased year over year. Following the results, the company’s shares moved down 1.8% in the after-hour trading session on Nov 3, 2022.Discussion on Earnings, Revenues &amp; CompsIn the quarter under review, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 75 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 2.6%. However, the bottom line increased 4.2% year over year from an adjusted EPS of 72 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Quarterly revenues of $8,713.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,805 million by 1%. However, the top line increased 8.2% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by growth in comparable store sales and net-new store on a year-over-year basis.This and solid performances in global licensed store businesses added to the positives. Global comparable store sales increased 5% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by a 7% rise in average tickets.In the fiscal first quarter, Starbucks opened 459 net new stores worldwide, bringing the total store count to 36,170.Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseStarbucks Corporation price-eps-surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteOverall Margin Falls in Q1On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin in fiscal first quarter was 14.4%, down from 14.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily caused by inflationary pressures and sales deleverage (related to COVID-19 restrictions in China).Higher investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training) were added concerns. However, this was partially offset by strategic pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets (outside China).Segmental DetailsStarbucks has three reportable operating segments — North America, International and Channel Development.North America: This segment’s fiscal first-quarter net revenues were $6,551.3 million, up 14% year over year. The segment benefited from 10% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales. Average ticket and transaction increased 9% and 1%, respectively.The operating margin in the North American segment was 18.5% compared with 18.9% reported in the prior-year quarter. A rise in commodity and supply-chain costs (on account of inflationary pressures) and investments in labor growth acted as headwinds. These were partly offset by strategic pricing and sales leverage.International: This segment’s fiscal first-quarter net revenues were $1,680.1 million, down 10.4% year over year, primarily due to a 13% decline in comparable store sales (owing to suppressed mobility in China) and a 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The decline was marginally overshadowed by net new store openings (8% year over year), higher product sales and royalty revenues.The operating margin in the segment contracted 1700 basis points (bps) year over year to 14.3%. The downside can be attributed to sales deleverage in China. However, this was partially offset by lapping amortization expenses, business mix and sales leverage across markets outside China.In the fiscal first quarter, comps in China declined 29% year over year (compared with a 16% fall reported in the previous quarter).

78,7d03cce5-a6c9-33e5-adaf-48e1dfa412f5,PH,2023-02-04,Why You Might Be Interested In Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-parker-hannifin-124427395.html,1675514667,STORY,['PH'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Parker-Hannifin's shares on or after the 9th of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 3rd of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.33 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.32 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Parker-Hannifin has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current share price of $350. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Parker-Hannifin's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Parker-Hannifin has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Parker-Hannifin has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 24% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 29% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Parker-Hannifin earnings per share are up 5.9% per annum over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Parker-Hannifin has delivered an average of 12% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Parker-Hannifin got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Parker-Hannifin is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Parker-Hannifin is halfway there. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Parker-Hannifin is facing. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Parker-Hannifin that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

84,a4d768d3-d3d2-3c5d-a103-b58503aa355d,XEL,2023-02-04,4 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-prospering-electric-141702424.html,1675433822,STORY,"['PPL', 'ED', 'XEL', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Company AEP, with a large investment to expand renewable operations, widespread transmission and distribution assets and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include Xcel Energy XEL, Consolidated Edison ED and PPL Corporation PPL.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years has resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 and 26% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 57 GW and 59 GW to be added in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 and further to 17% in 2024. The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, 2023 electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1% in 2023 and rise more than 1% in 2024, EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 is due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In February 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate a range of 4.50%-4.75%. This is the eighth increase in interest rates since March 2022, with more expected to come in 2023.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Since March 2022, earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up 1.9%. Looking at the upward earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are showing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Utility Electric Power industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 and its own sector over the past 12 months.

The company said it will be able to maintain production until an agreement with the union is reached.The strike was the latest of a rash of labor disputes at U.S. manufacturing facilities, often stoked by frustrations that wages are not keeping pace with inflation while corporations are reaping massive profits.ADM last month reported a record-large fourth-quarter profit and forecast continued strong earnings in 2023.""ADM is refusing to offer these workers wages and benefits on par with what union members receive at other union facilities,"" J.P. Fyans, Local 916 president, said in a media statement.ADM has offered the members ""an extremely competitive proposal"" and continues to negotiate with the union in good faith, said company spokesperson Jackie Anderson.""We have a robust plan in place to maintain production levels until we can reach a satisfactory resolution,"" she said.The Decatur site, ADM's global headquarters until a move to Chicago a decade ago, houses a soybean crushing plant and one of the largest corn wet mills in the world.

Technology is being used to automate and streamline manufacturing operations, with the ultimate goal of maximizing efficiency and reducing costs. Industrial software products can range from simple data tracking and analysis platforms to complex process control systems that utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence.The industrial software industry is also changing the way companies think about their operations. By leveraging the power of industrial software, companies can create a data-driven culture that is focused on continuous improvement. This shift in mindset can help companies gain a competitive edge by improving their operational efficiency and reducing costs. Today, industrial software is used in a variety of industries, ranging from manufacturing and engineering to power generation and healthcare.An Analysis of the Global Industrial Software Industry: Size, Drivers, Challenges, and Regional InsightsAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global industrial software market was worth $92.58 billion in 2021, and is expected to grow to $157.41 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 9.25% from 2022 through 2027.The industrial software market is experiencing expansion due to the increasing popularity of industrial cloud computing technology. With cloud computing, IT services are accessible via web-based applications instead of connecting to a server directly. Industrial cloud computing allows the transmission of data to the software programs that automate workflows and the applications used on computers or mobile devices. Additionally, the growth of the market is attributed to various factors, such as the rise in spending on software, the development of industry 4.0, the increasing need for operational efficiency, the growing electronics industry, and the digital transformation of businesses.Story continuesMoreover, the industrial software market is expected to grow due to the integration of AI with industrial software, the rising adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and the implementation of digital twins. Businesses use digital twins to reduce equipment failure risk and automate repairs. This leads to scalable, cost-effective, and agile supply chain operations.However, there are some challenges the global industrial software industry is faced with. These include hefty initial investments and cybersecurity. While the integration of cloud, mobile, IoT, and AI streamlines industrial processes, it also creates greater security, compliance, and data protection challenges. IoT and cloud computing help industrial software run smoothly but these technologies also make data more vulnerable to getting hacked.According to the Research and Markets, North America held the largest market share of the industrial software market in 2021 due to increasing adoption of industrial software by SMEs, and the increased investments by vendors in tech-driven software. The Asia Pacific region is expected to expand over the forecasted period due to a booming manufacturing industry and SMEs. Additionally, government support for IT infrastructure in the region is expected to fuel market growth further.The industrial software industry is expected to continue to grow as companies continue to look for ways to improve their operations. As technology advances, the demand for more efficient and effective industrial software solutions will increase. As a result, companies are investing in new software products and solutions to help them meet the growing demand for industrial software.

93,bf2a2ff6-25ee-3437-a75b-a6b5c778b7c5,PM,2023-02-04,12 Countries that Export the Most Tobacco in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-export-most-tobacco-171532451.html,1675444532,STORY,"['BTI', 'PM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the twelve countries that export the most tobacco in the world. For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries that Export the Most Tobacco in the World. Tobacco is one of the more controversial plants today, as the prevalence of cigarettes and other forms of smoke-able tobacco have been known to cause different kinds of cancers. Tobacco is not only directly smoked, it is also used in hookahs, sheeshas, and chewing tobacco.The global tobacco industry is worth billions of dollars. According to a research report from Grand View Market Research, the global tobacco market was worth a stunning $849 billion in 2021. Between 2022 and 2030, the research firm expects the sector to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.4% to be worth more than a trillion dollars by the end of the forecast period. This growth comes despite the rising knowledge of the harms of tobacco consumption and a myriad of different alternative products flooding the market. The research firm rather cynically points out that the coronavirus pandemic ended up helping the industry. While the disease itself is of the respiratory system - which is damaged by smoking - Grand View Market Research believes that the stress of the pandemic caused people to smoke more, and cigarette companies will benefit from this higher usage.Commenting on the market trends, the research firm outlines that tobacco firms spend a whopping $8.9 billion in advertising in 2019, which amounted to $1 million being spent every hour. It adds that while developed countries are seeing a reduction in smoking, emerging economies such as those Thailand and India are seeing an uptick in smoking, as their youth populations grow. Cigarettes are by far the most commonly consumed tobacco products, as they represented 86% of the overall revenue in 2021.These days, both large tobacco firms such as Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) and other smaller firms are paying attention to smokeless cigarettes - some of which are called electronic cigarettes. While only a recent trend, e-cigarettes have been around since the early 1960s. These alternative tobacco products are of several different kinds. Some of these heat tobacco to generate inhalable nicotine, while others shun nicotine entirely and switch to a nicotine liquid to generate vapor. The global heated tobacco market was worth $4.16 billion in 2021 according to a research report from Research and Markets, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR ranging between 10% and 11% between 2022 and 2027.Story continuesTraditional tobacco firms are eager to make a strong entry into the next generation product (NGP) market. Almost all have acquired stakes in or completely bought firms making these products. The earliest mover was Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB.L) which created a subsidiary called Fontem Ventures in 2012. Fontem is an e-cigarette manufacturer, and Imperial expanded its presence in the sector by acquiring the blu e-cigarette in 2014 after having already bought another e-cigarette company a year earlier. The crown 'jewel' of the e-cigarette industry, Juul Labs, also saw a 35% stake being acquired by the maker of Marlboro Cigarettes in 2019.In terms of technology, the tobacco industry is also utilizing technology to improve farming practices. For instance, Cropin Technology provides solutions that enable tobacco farmers and the big companies that buy their products to ensure that the supply chain is free from child labor. This is achieved via digitally registering the farmer, profiling them, and tracking the field staff. Additionally, the firm's technology also allows farmers to digitally monitor their fields for pests, monitor weather, and set timelines for harvesting and packaging the products. The Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets are crucial tools in this avenue and has allowed Chinese tobacco firms to manage warehouses by pre-assigning slots to brands, managing warehouse climate, efficiently picking, packing, and sorting the products, and creating optimal production environments.Given its size, the tobacco industry is home to some of the largest companies on the planet. Alongside some that are already mentioned, other big players are British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI), Japan Tobacco Inc. (OTCMKTS:JAPAF), and China Tobacco International (HK) Company Limited (HKG:6055.HK).12 Countries that Produce the Best Tobacco in the WorldCopyright: andresr / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We have used trade data from the United Nations and the World Trade Organization to sift out the largest tobacco exporters on Earth. There is one surprising Asian country in our list of the top 5 countries that export the most tobacco. Can you guess which country is the number 1 tobacco exporter in Asia?12 Countries that Export the Most Tobacco in the World12. Republic of IndiaTobacco Exports in 2021: $911 million The Republic of India is an Asian country that is the second most populous country in the world. India exported $911 million worth of tobacco in 2021, marking a 2% drop since 2017 but an 8% annual growth. Tobacco is produced in several Indian states, such as Gujrat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Karnataka, and Bihar. Gujrat is the largest tobacco producing state, with a 45% share of the market. India's largest tobacco companies are ITC Limited (NSE:ITC.NS), Godfrey Phillips India Limited (NSE:GODFRYPHLP.NS), and VST Industries Limited (NSE:VSTIND.NS). Put together, the industry makes India one of the top exporters of tobacco in the world.11. NetherlandsTobacco Exports in 2021: $1.1 billionThe Netherlands, also known as Holland, is a prosperous Northwestern country that is one of the most developed nations in the world. Like some other countries on our list, Holland is also dominated by the big tobacco companies - nearly all of which have a presence in the country. Additionally, due to its colonial history, the Netherlands also has its own tobacco company, Koninklijke Theodorus Niemeyer BV, which was a family owned business that first started selling tobacco in the 1800s. Koninklijke Theodorus Niemeyer BV is now a part of British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI). Tobacco is produced all over the country, in regions such as Wageningen, Gelderland, Nijkerk, and Elst. The Dutch government is quite strict with its tobacco laws and is currently passing legislation to ensure plain packaging for e cigarettes and cigars, and also banning the sale of non tobacco flavored e cigarette liquids.10. Republic of IndonesiaTobacco Exports in 2021: $1.14 billionThe Republic of Indonesia is an Asian and Oceanic island country. Commonly called a 'Tiger Cub' economy, the country has seen some economic growth over the past few decades. Indonesia is also believed to have the highest smoking rate in the world, which has sometimes been as high as 67% among adults. Naturally, it's unsurprising that Indonesia has its own type of cigarette called the Kretek. These are unfiltered cigarettes that are made of tobacco, cloves, and other flavors. Some of the largest Indonesian tobacco firms are PT Bentoel Internasional Investama Tbk (IDX:RMBA.JK), PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk (owned by Phillip Morris), PT Perusahaan Rokok Tjap Gudang Garam Tbk (IDX:GGRM.JK), and PT Djarum - a pureplay kretek manufacturer.9. United States of AmericaTobacco Exports in 2021: $1.17 billionThe United States of America, or the U.S., is the world's only superpower and the largest economy in nominal terms. Tobacco is produced in several American states, such as North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia. Tobacco production in the U.S. has been going on for centuries, with the first plantations having started before the American War of Independence, and at one time, tobacco was also used as a means of barter. Two of the world's largest tobacco companies, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) are American, and others include R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) and Liggett Group. Naturally, the large firms also make America one country with the most tobacco exports in the world.8. Dominican RepublicTobacco Exports in 2021: $1.2 billionThe Dominican Republic is a Caribbean country that is the most prosperous in the region. When it comes to the tobacco world, the country is known primarily for its cigars, with rolled tobacco representing close to 10% of the Dominican Republic's exports. Some varieties of local tobacco are San Vicente, Piloto Cubano, and Olor Dominicano. All of these are used in cigars, and one of the largest Dominican cigar companies is Quesada Cigars which started its business in the 1800s after a family debt was paid in tobacco.7. Federative Republic of BrazilTobacco Exports in 2021: $1.4 billionThe Federative Republic of Brazil, or simply Brazil, is the largest country in Latin and South America, alongside being one of the most developed in the region. It is also the world's second largest tobacco producer, coming second to China and producing 762,266 tons in 2019. Brazilian tobacco is named after the region that it is grown in, and some popular types are Mata Fina, Arapiraca, and Brazilian-Sumatra. Brazil's largest tobacco company, Souza Cruz S.A., is a British American Tobacco subsidiary.6. RomaniaTobacco Exports in 2021: $1.5 billionRomania is a Central European country with a high GDP per capita of $38,097. Tobacco use is quite common in the country, with an estimated 27% of all adults thought to smoke. The Romanian tobacco industry is dominated by big tobacco companies, and the first company to set up shop in the country was Japan Tobacco Inc. (OTCMKTS:JAPAF). This has also led to a near wipeout of the local industry, which often produced cigarettes and products unique to Romania. One popular Romanian cigarette was the Carpați - which was produced in six factories. To make things interesting, each factory produced its own variant, which then led to a rare occasion where smokers preferred the factory instead of the cigarette.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and Salesforce, Inc. (CRM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walmart shares have more than proved their defensive attributes in the market turmoil that got underway a year ago. The stock is essentially flat over the past year (up +0.2%), which compares to the -7.3% decline for the Zacks Retail sector and -8% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in the last quarterly release. A robust third-quarter show encouraged management to raise its overall guidance for fiscal 2023.However, its consolidated operating income and earnings per share view still suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost inflation, and expects it to remain elevated.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Alibaba have over the last couple of months, reflecting the company's leverage to expectations of a consumer spending rebound in the wake of China ending its zero-Covid policies and associated restrictions. The stock is still down over the past year, but it is up an impressive +52% over the last three months compared to the +17.5% gain for the Zacks Retail sector and +11.2% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index. Story continuesAlibaba’s solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively.The Zacks analyst expects that China commerce and international commerce to be up 11.2% and 7.2% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively. Further, strength across the local consumer services, Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well to the top-line growth.Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, public services and telecommunication industries are driving the cloud computing business. Our estimates suggest cloud revenues to witness a 6.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from the year-ago reported figure.(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-20.3% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing stiff competition is a concern. Besides, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers are an overhang on near-term profitability.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started.However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. The Fed Chairman said “While recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path.” Powell hinted at a few more interest rate hikes in 2023.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors will try to safeguard their portfolios.

If you want to see more best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.Value stocks are stocks of companies generally considered trading below what many investors think they are worth. Because different investors could view a stock differently, what a stock is worth is subjective. Some investors might view a stock as a value stock while others might find the same stock expensive.To find value stocks, we chose stocks that are included in the The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV).According to the ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) 'seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&amp;P® 500 Value Index (the “Index”).The S&amp;P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value segment in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price ratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.'Value stocks can decline as stocks can always trade for lower than what investors think they are worth. As a ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) declined as a whole last year and it could decline this year if economic data doesn't meet estimates.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. When companies have excess capital, many decide to return the excess capital through a stock buyback or by paying a dividend.When profits change, dividends can change. In good times, many companies increase their dividend when their profits increase. In more difficult times, many companies lower their dividends or suspend them altogether.In terms of the economy in 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of being a little stronger than some expected in terms of Q4 GDP. Inflation has also shown signs of potentially peaking last year.Story continuesIn terms of the effect of increased interest rates on inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on February 1, 2023, ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far.""Nevertheless, Powell also said, ""It would be very premature to declare victory, or to think that we’ve really got this.""If economic data doesn't meet estimates, stocks could always decline, including the best value stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy, we selected value stocks from the 407 holdings of the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) as of February 2, 2023.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they paid dividends and that they had considerable earnings growth potential in the next ten years if they maintained their market share.We then sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy13.

Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Goldman Sachs in FocusBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 7.6%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $2.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.71% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.47% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.39%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, GS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $33.32 per share, with earnings expected to increase 10.84% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some stocks to sell per Burry, go directly to Michael Burry Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks He Sold.There are few hedge fund managers on Wall Street who command as much attention during an economic slowdown as Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management, the renowned investor of The Big Short fame who rose to stardom after accurately predicting the financial crisis of 2008 and making hundreds of millions from shorting the housing market. Burry, who manages a 13F stock portfolio worth just $41 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022, has repeatedly warned investors in the past few months that the stock market is about to crash. Burry held stakes in top stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in the past year or so but sold off these positions entirely in the second quarter of 2022, trying to shield his fund from the impact of the slowing economy. Burry recently tweeted that the market was mimicking the patterns seen in 2007. He also teased his followers on Twitter by saying that they had no idea how many shorts bets he had on this collapse. The stocks that Burry sold off in the past few months have been severely impacted by the macro slowing of the economy. Of the 10 stocks that he sold off in the second and third quarter of 2022, seven have witnessed their share prices decline by more than 10% in the past year. Of the three remaining stocks, one is down in the past six months and the other one year-to-date. Only one of these stocks, Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST), is trading up by more than 20% in the past twelve months. Our MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the investment portfolio of Scion Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The stocks which the hedge fund sold off completely in the past few months were selected. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. It is important to clarify that Burry, in the past few months, has repeatedly warned of a looming market crash, advising investors to prepare for a crisis unlike anything seen before. He sold off his entire portfolio in the second quarter of 2022 to shield his fund from the impact of such a crash. Story continuesMichael Burry Stock Portfolio: 10 Stocks He SoldMichael Burry of Scion Asset ManagementMichael Burry Stock Portfolio: Stocks He Sold10. Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22    Decline in Share Price Over Past Year: 10%  Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH) operates as an outdoor sporting goods retailer in the United States. On September 1, Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $0.36, beating market estimates by $0.10. The revenue over the period was $351 million, down 3.0% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating market estimates by $12.73 million. Burry bought a stake in the firm in the first quarter of 2022 but sold it during the second quarter. On September 26, B. Riley analyst Eric Wold maintained a Buy rating on Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH) stock and raised the price target to $16 from $14, noting that management plans to accelerate store growth in the coming years with the flexible store format.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 22 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $105.9 million in Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH), compared to 20 in the previous quarter worth $108.8 million.Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH) is one of the stocks feeling the heat of an economic slowdown. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Merion Road Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“During the quarter I added to Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPWH). SPWH is an outdoor sporting goods retailer with about half of its revenue coming from hunting &amp; shooting products (guns, ammo). I initiated our position back in December following their failed merger with Great Outdoors on the grounds of anti‐trust concerns. It appeared that the stock was being sold off indiscriminately by merger arbitrageurs and valuation seemed attractive, particularly after adjusting for the receipt of a $55mm termination payment and unwind of excess inventory.While the dust has largely settled from an investor base perspective, SPWH remains attractively priced with a few upcoming catalysts. Fundamentally the company is well-positioned. Following the tragic Parkland school shooting two large competitors to SPWH, Dicks Sporting Goods and Walmart decided to exit the category; their absence makes the competitive landscape for SPWH a lot more favorable than in prior years. Furthermore, it is no surprise that gun and ammo sales during covid experienced tremendous growth. Unlike prior cycles, however, this wave saw an increase in new gun buyers rather than purchases by existing owners. SPWH estimates that over the past 18 months the industry created 12mm new firearm owners; using a prior base of 100mm, this implies an increase to their addressable market of 12%. The company is executing many other internal initiatives including store expansion, omnichannel growth (e‐comm up to 15% of revenues), loyalty programs (at 3mm members) and new co‐branded credit cards…(read more)9. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25     Decline in Share Price Over Past Year: 12%  Stellantis N.V.

(NASDAQ:NXST) with 965,922 shares worth more than $161 million.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Richie Capital Group, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Nexstar Media Group (NXST up 24.8%) – The television broadcasting and digital media company surged during the quarter after presenting at an investor conference where management pointed to a strong 2022 for both political advertising and retransmission. They have exposure to more than 80% of markets with competitive mid-term political races. NXST is developing new ad categories such as sports betting and they are focused on expanding digital ad revenue and providing digital solutions to local advertisers.

(NYSE:OVV) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Oil and gas exploration and production company Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) fell as oil prices faded late in the quarter due to aggressive Fed rate hikes and growing credit fears in emerging markets, a source of demand growth for oil. Although oil and fuel product inventories remain scarce, the Fed has been so aggressive with rhetoric and tightening that the dollar rose sharply and investor sentiment shifted toward anticipating a recession. Ovintiv is a self-help improvement story as it lowers debt levels through cash generation and asset sales while detailing plans to buy back shares more aggressively and pay a higher dividend.”6. Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59    Decline in Share Price Over Past Year: 22%  Global Payments Inc.

MAT is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.3% and 0.5%, respectively.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 27 cents compared with 53 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. In the past 30 days, earnings estimates for the current quarter have been revised downward by 2 cents. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $1.65 billion compared to the prior year’s reported value, suggesting a decline of 7.6% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteThe company’s fourth-quarter performance might have been dampened by a decline in sales in North America and international sales. We expect North America and international sales to decline 10.9% and 10.2% year over year to $911.8 million and $692.6 million, respectively. The dismal performance of Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends), Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, Other (primarily Games and Other) and Dolls (including Barbie) categories are likely to have negatively impacted North America sales.Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteCost inflation may have negatively impacted the company’s operations due to a rise in raw materials and ocean freight costs, which, in turn, may have weighed on the company’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. In fourth-quarter 2022, we expect the adjusted gross margin to decline to 46.9% from 49.3% in the prior-year quarter.However, international sales from Hot Wheels, Lightyear and Jurassic World are likely to aid the company’s results in the quarter to be reported. Favorable pricing actions and incremental realized savings from the Optimizing for Growth program bode well.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mattel this time around.

Its adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.1% but decreased 26.8% from the year-ago quarter. The company’s net sales topped the consensus mark by 5.1% but declined 2% from the prior-year level.Its earnings surpassed the consensus mark in each of the trailing 10 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Leggett’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has remained stable at 48 cents per share over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 37.7% decline from the year-ago earnings of 77 cents per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $1.22 billion, suggesting an 8.5% fall year over year.Factors to NoteLeggett’s business is expected to have lackluster trade sales and earnings in fourth-quarter 2022 thanks to persistent supply chain disruptions and chemical, semiconductor, labor, and transportation-related woes. Also, supplier production disruptions and logistics challenges are likely to have added to the negatives. The company expects the fourth quarter to be slightly lower than the third quarter, primarily due to further reductions in steel rod production in response to the slowing steel market.Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseLeggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated Quote For the fourth quarter, net sales are expected to be within $1.15–$1.25 billion and earnings per share are anticipated to be between 42 cents and 57 cents. This reflects an almost 10% and 35.7% year-over-year decline, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bedding Products’ trade sales (accounting for 48.4% of total 2021 revenues) is pegged at $546 million, indicating a decrease of 15.6% from $647 million in the year-ago period.The consensus estimates for trade sales from the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment (comprising 31.9% of total revenues) are pegged at $393 million, indicating a 6.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s $421.6 million.Organically, the consensus estimate for total sales is likely to decline 9% versus the 3% decline reported a year ago.Nonetheless, its systematic inorganic drive — which has been strongly contributing to top line growth — should have aided total sales. Also, strong demand in the Specialized Products segment, particularly in Automotive, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders, a favorable selling price, and Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition are likely to have added benefits. Raw material-related selling price increases and a focus on containment of fixed costs are expected to have supported growth.For Specialized Products (comprising 19.7% of total revenues), the consensus estimate for the segment’s trade sales is pegged at $279 million, indicating an improvement of 5.7% year over year from $264 million.Story continues What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Leggett this time around.

The bottom line also climbed 5% year over year.Total revenues of $3,130 million were up 2% from a year ago and beat the consensus mark of $3,120 million and our estimate of $3,079.9 million.

111,6d1fb9c5-d2fb-38bc-b61b-dd5682adb6cf,AIG,2023-02-04,Should Value Investors Buy American International Group (AIG) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-american-international-144002757.html,1675435202,STORY,"['AIG', 'CNO']","[Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.American International Group (AIG) is a stock many investors are watching right now. AIG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.58, which compares to its industry's average of 9.68. Over the past year, AIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.69 and as low as 7.98, with a median of 10.07.AIG is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.96. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AIG's industry has an average PEG of 1.58 right now. Over the past 52 weeks, AIG's PEG has been as high as 1.47 and as low as 0.84, with a median of 1.03.Investors should also recognize that AIG has a P/B ratio of 1.12. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.12. Within the past 52 weeks, AIG's P/B has been as high as 1.18 and as low as 0.66, with a median of 0.88.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AIG has a P/S ratio of 0.74. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.89.Investors could also keep in mind CNO Financial Group (CNO), an Insurance - Multi line stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.CNO Financial Group also has a P/B ratio of 2.30 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.12. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.30, as low as 0.53, with a median of 0.94.These are only a few of the key metrics included in American International Group and CNO Financial Group strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, AIG and CNO look like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

112,985b5432-27fd-3e21-baf2-c3c377a2dee3,AIG,2023-02-04,"After Plunging -7.05% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why the Trend Might Reverse for American International Group (AIG)",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plunging-7-05-4-weeks-143502844.html,1675434902,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group (AIG) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 7.1% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why AIG Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of AIG shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.82. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for AIGThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AIG in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 3.3% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, AIG currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.1%. At the constant exchange rate (“CER”), revenues decreased 7%. Additional sales from newly-acquired businesses contributed approximately 240 basis points of growth.The quarterly sales were significantly impacted due to the implementation of a new warehouse management system. The company had previously withdrawn its guidance for full-year 2022 in November last year, citing temporary disruption due to implementation of this new warehouse management software. It is intended to increase the efficiency and performance of its primary distribution facility. However, the new software created shipping disruptions that lasted longer than originally projected.CONMED Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCONMED Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCONMED Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | CONMED Corporation QuoteFull Year ResultsCONMED reported full-year revenues of $1.01 billion, up 3.4% year over year.

Research and development expenses rose 7.6% year over year to $12.2 million.The company recorded an operating loss of $1.1 million against operating profit of $37.2 million in the prior-year quarter.2023 Guidance MaintainedCONMED announced updated guidance for revenues and EPS in 2023. The company now expects reported revenues to be between $1.170 billion and $1.220 billion for full-year 2023, implying growth of 14.3% over 2022. Previously, it expected revenues to be between $1.170 billion and $1.230 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $1.21 billion.Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected in the range of $3.20-$3.45 compared with the previous expectation of $3.20-$3.50. Current EPS guidance indicates an anticipated improvement of 20.8-30.2% year-over-year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $3.37.It expects foreign exchange to have unfavorable impact on the top line growth by 150 and 200 basis points in 2023. EPS is likely to be impacted negatively by 20-25 cents due to currency rates.Shares of CONMED were down 4.1% during after-hours trading on Feb 2, following the significantly lower-than-expected earnings, and lower revenues and EPS outlook for 2023. However, the company’s shares have gained 5.7% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOur TakeCONMED exited the fourth quarter on a weaker note, wherein earnings and revenues missed their respective consensus mark significantly. The current decline in revenues and EPS is most likely due to the implementation of the new system, which hampered the company’s ability to ship customer orders. Although the disruption during the implementation phase will gradually improve, duration of the system’s successful integration is yet to be seen. The company is steadily resolving the issues and clearing its backlog of orders created due to the software-related disruption. Management, on the fourth-quarter earning,s call stated that the company’s global shipping volumes are at or above normal daily volumes. We expect sales and EPS to improve significantly as the system-related disruption wanes.Meanwhile, the acquisition of In2Bones and Biorez last year is likely to bring additional sales for CONMED in 2023. Revenues from these two companies’ businesses exceeded management’s expectation so far.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, CONMED carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Neogen, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of 15 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents per share.

115,4d6272f0-a320-33ec-b337-a5b93e6b74fd,NFLX,2023-02-04,Analyzing Disney Stock with Q1 Earnings Looming,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyzing-disney-stock-q1-earnings-224210317.html,1675464130,STORY,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[Disney DIS shares have climbed 27% to start 2023 with the company scheduled to release its first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings report on Wednesday, February 8.After such an impressive and extensive rally, the report will be critical to any further upside left in Disney stock in the near term. And investors may be pondering what lies ahead for the media and entertainment conglomerate.Let’s take a look at what’s going on with Disney stock in the week leading up to its fiscal Q1 report.Momentum After a tremulous 2022 for many tech and consumer discretionary stocks, these equities have rallied to start the new year as signs of inflation beginning to ease have served as a catalyst along with the possibility of a less hawkish fed.This has led to Disney and Netflix NFLX, its primary competitor in terms of streaming content, both skyrocketing in the last month, with their Consumer Discretionary sector up +18% year to date. Still, Disney’s performance over the last three months has lagged behind its Consumer Discretionary peers, making its fiscal Q1 report crucial to regaining its dominance in the sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus for Disney’s Q1 earnings is $0.69 per share, which would be a -35% decline from Q1 2022 EPS of $1.06. Also, with the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.67 per share, this indicates that Disney could fall short on its bottom-line expectations by -3.37%.On the top line, Q1 sales are forecasted to be $23.33 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. This reflects that Disney continues to struggle with tougher operating conditions and broader economic challenges as its bottom line is expected to dip despite YoY quarterly sales growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverall, Disney earnings are expected to rise 9% in FY23 and climb another 36% in FY24 at $5.27 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline over the last quarter. Sales are forecasted to be up 9% in FY23 and rise another 7% in FY24 to $97.11 billion. Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSubscriber Growth Along with overall top and bottom-line growth, Wall Street will be monitoring the growth of Disney’s streaming services among its Direct-to-Consumer segment. While its Direct to Consumer services are not profitable yet, subscriber growth has been very intriguing in terms of the long-term outlook it could have for the company.However, last quarter the operating loss among the segment increased from - $0.8 billion to -$1.5 billion, and it will be important to see if Disney was able to contract these losses during Q1.The increase in the operating loss was due to a higher loss among Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu. Still, the subscriber growth among Disney+ in particular continues to be compelling following its launch in 2019 with the service striving to rival Netflix subscriptions.During Q4, Disney+ subscribers grew by 8% to 164.2 million with the company stating the service should be profitable when it reaches 260 million subscribers. Disney estimates it could hit this target by 2024 and eventually dethrone Netflix as the king of subscription videos on demand (SVODs).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation &amp; Historical PerformanceTrading at $110 per share and 28.5X forward earnings, Disney stock trades nicely below its decade-long high of 134.4X and closer to the median of 19.8X with its industry average at 25.2X.Over the last year, Disney stock is still down -21% to underperform the Consumer Discretionary sectors -16%, while also lagging the S&amp;P 500’ and Netflix’s -8% performances. In the last decade, Disney’s +105% has also trailed the benchmark, and Netflix’s stellar +1363% performance but topped the Consumer Discretionary sectors’ +51%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineHeading into its fiscal Q1 report, Disney stock lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the moment. This is in correlation with the declining earnings estimates for the current quarter, Fiscal 2023, and FY24. After such an impressive start to the new year Disney stock may be due for a pullback and there could be better opportunities despite the stock still trading attractively relative to its past.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Brooke DiPalma is here with the buzz ahead of the big game. It is exciting to see how early they roll out the ads to generate the excitement.BROOKE DI PALMA: Earlier and earlier. And for me, as we discussed before this segment, I'm not really here for the game. I'm here for the commercials, for the food--DAVE BRIGGS: Fair. That's fair.BROOKE DI PALMA: --for the entertainment.DAVE BRIGGS: Most are.BROOKE DI PALMA: But it's amazing to see just how much these food and beverage companies are bringing to the table and just how much they're spending to bring these commercials to the table. So I spoke to one marketing professor who said for a 30-second ad, you're looking at $7 million. Add $2 million for production. Add $2 million to promote that on social media. Add $2 million for promotions. And if you're going to add another 30 seconds, make that $14 million on top of the 6, and call that $20 million for a one-minute ad on Super Bowl Sunday.Now before the game even starts, these marketing professors say that you should actually already see your return in investment. So that's pretty amazing to see how much you're investing. And just know that before it actually even airs, you should see how much you paid, $20 million already back. Now if we take a look at some of the big names here, partnerships is going to be a big deal this Super Bowl Sunday. We saw General Motors team up with Netflix, but ironically, we also saw Michelob Ultra team up with Netflix, promote their ""Full Swing,"" the documentary.- What are y'all watching?- ""Full Swing."" It's a new golf show on Netflix.Story continues- Come on, Justin.BROOKE DI PALMA: So partnerships are really key here. When you think about other partnerships that we're going to see, it's the Molson Coors ad that teams up with DraftKings, both intended to meet a more consumer-friendly, buzzy audience, looking to draw attention here then maybe they want to get from their primary audience.And another company that we're hearing a lot of buzz ahead of the Super Bowl is M&amp;M's, ahead of their official rebranding to M&amp;Yeahs with Maya Rudolph. Now, apparently, that's drumming a lot of buzz, but apparently, it might be a publicity stunt here. And we did not hear back from M&amp;M, so there's lots of speculation about that. According to a TV measurement analytics company, this is already performing 88% more. That's that people are engaging 88% more than this time last year with M&amp;M's ad. So whether it's a publicity stunt or not--DAVE BRIGGS: It is.BROOKE DI PALMA: --it's working.SEANA SMITH: It is. It is a publicity stunt. But it's clearly working. So Brooke, you just laid out how much it costs for all of these brands to advertise--BROOKE DI PALMA: Insane.SEANA SMITH: --during the Super Bowl. Clearly, not everyone's doing it. Some people are trying to drum up some of their own excitement.BROOKE DI PALMA: That's right.SEANA SMITH: You've got them out right here.BROOKE DI PALMA: Yeah, well, people are just saying, forget the Super Bowl Sunday, and let's just go straight to the product. So here in front of us, we have Kraft Heinz Ketchup. Their logo is 57. I'll put this right back there so you guys can see it. It's 57. And they're saying, forget the Roman numerals. They're putting out a sweepstakes asking consumers, should we just forget them? In addition to that, Hormel Chili coming out with this chili cheese beer. They teamed up with a local brewery to do this. Let's all pass it around. Let's have a taste. But essentially, they're just saying that packaged food companies aren't performing as well on Super Bowl Sunday as maybe they used to be when there wasn't social media. And so now these companies like Hormel and like Kraft Heinz are opting for new ways.DAVE BRIGGS: So just--SEANA SMITH: Oh, this tastes interesting.DAVE BRIGGS: Just, again, in case you missed it, this is chili cheese beer from Hormel.SEANA SMITH: I thought it was going to be a lot better. I thought it was going to be good.BROOKE DI PALMA: It does taste like-- it actually does smell like chili. It really does.SEANA SMITH: It tastes a little too much like chili.BROOKE DI PALMA: It really does. It tastes like--SEANA SMITH: Let's have your review.BROOKE DI PALMA: Is there such thing as a chili broth? Because that's what it tastes like.JARED BLIKRE: Whew.BROOKE DI PALMA: Jared--DAVE BRIGGS: I don't mind that.JARED BLIKRE: You know, I'm actually--SEANA SMITH: It's a weird aftertaste.JARED BLIKRE: --pretty glad that I don't drink anymore because it sounds a little bit scary. So I'm just going to let you get--- OK, we have that product placement expert that--BROOKE DI PALMA: Oh, my God.DAVE BRIGGS: It's an acquired taste.SEANA SMITH: It is.BROOKE DI PALMA: But these are already sold out online, Hormel Foods confirmed. And so when you think about just how much excitement this drummed up, maybe it'll get people to go down the condiment aisle as opposed to not.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: It's growing on me in like 30 seconds.SEANA SMITH: Oh, it's growing on you. Yeah, I don't know if it's just the time that it's Friday, and I'm kind of in the mood for a drink, or if I-- or if this is--JARED BLIKRE: Let me smell this.SEANA SMITH: --growing on me.BROOKE DI PALMA: It smells a little like chili.SEANA SMITH: It smells a little-- yeah, it tastes a little bit too much like the real thing.BROOKE DI PALMA: Certainly a new way to drum up excitement ahead of the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: It is, and it's working. We're talking about it right here on the show.DAVE BRIGGS: Miller and Coors executives join us Monday to talk about--BROOKE DI PALMA: Ooh.DAVE BRIGGS: --their first Super Bowl ad in 30 years.BROOKE DI PALMA: With Draft Kings.JARED BLIKRE: Somebody has to take the empty, right?SEANA SMITH: There we go. All right, Brooke, thanks so much.BROOKE DI PALMA: Thank--]"

He expects the new sanctions will play out in a similar way that the EU's crude oil ban has, meaning Russian volumes will not see a meaningful dip as exports are rerouted from Europe to other countries.""Everything we have seen over the last year tells us not to underestimate that Russia hasn't got this figured out,"" Smith said.Meanwhile, a price cap on Russian fuels will also be imposed. Similar to the crude oil price cap, the EU and G7 plan to bar other countries from accessing insurance and shipping services unless they abide by a cap on refined products.But Smith expects the new price cap to be a moot point, as it will likely be too high to be relevant. There are also too many different products with different prices to justify any single price cap, which will make it harder to implement than previous ceilings.Story continuesIn addition to diesel, Russia produces a range of other refined products, including jet fuel and fuel oil, requiring separate price caps for each.Regardless of the price cap, buyers of Russian fuels will likely see discounts when the ban takes effect, Smith predicted.Discounted oil prices have allowed Russia to maintain strong seaborne crude exports even after the December embargo. While Moscow's energy revenue has fallen, the key point is that neither Russian production nor exports have crashed, Smith noted.""You have countries, such as India, that's able to purchase Russian crude at a significant discount, and so they do it,"" he said. ""We've seen a number of EU countries taking crude and diesel from Russia over the last year because of the economics, rather than self-sanctioning. Pricing has driven the energy situation with Russia.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

(NEE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nee-attracting-140002318.html,1675432802,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[NextEra Energy (NEE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Have returned -8.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +9% change. The Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, to which NextEra belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.NextEra is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.39 indicates a change of +8.7% from what NextEra is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NextEra is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of NextEra, the consensus sales estimate of $6.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +116.9%. The $27.05 billion and $29.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +29.1% and +9.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNextEra reported revenues of $6.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.2%. EPS of $0.51 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.33%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.NextEra is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about NextEra. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He expects the new sanctions will play out in a similar way that the EU's crude oil ban has, meaning Russian volumes will not see a meaningful dip as exports are rerouted from Europe to other countries.""Everything we have seen over the last year tells us not to underestimate that Russia hasn't got this figured out,"" Smith said.Meanwhile, a price cap on Russian fuels will also be imposed. Similar to the crude oil price cap, the EU and G7 plan to bar other countries from accessing insurance and shipping services unless they abide by a cap on refined products.But Smith expects the new price cap to be a moot point, as it will likely be too high to be relevant. There are also too many different products with different prices to justify any single price cap, which will make it harder to implement than previous ceilings.Story continuesIn addition to diesel, Russia produces a range of other refined products, including jet fuel and fuel oil, requiring separate price caps for each.Regardless of the price cap, buyers of Russian fuels will likely see discounts when the ban takes effect, Smith predicted.Discounted oil prices have allowed Russia to maintain strong seaborne crude exports even after the December embargo. While Moscow's energy revenue has fallen, the key point is that neither Russian production nor exports have crashed, Smith noted.""You have countries, such as India, that's able to purchase Russian crude at a significant discount, and so they do it,"" he said. ""We've seen a number of EU countries taking crude and diesel from Russia over the last year because of the economics, rather than self-sanctioning. Pricing has driven the energy situation with Russia.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

And now, to comments from Qualcomm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Cristiano Amon.Cristiano Amon: Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and short-term challenges impacting the semiconductor industry, we delivered revenues of $9.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.37 per share, including year-over-year growth in QCT Automotive in IoT. QCT revenues of $7.9 billion were down 11% year-over-year as a result of weaker handset demand and inventory drawdown. In the current quarter, combined auto and IoT revenues represent 27% of total QCT revenues, reflecting continued progress on revenue diversification. QTL delivered $1.5 billion in revenues within Q1. As the handset industry continues to experience reduced demand, we are now expecting elevated channel inventory levels to persist at least through the first half of calendar 23.Story continuesIn addition, multiple end industries within IoT are also experiencing weaker-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels. Given the current macroeconomic and demand environment, we're implementing further spending reductions and streamlining operations without losing sight of the significant growth and diversification opportunities ahead. This is consistent with our commitment to actively manage operating expenses as indicated during our last earnings call. Combined with the actions we have already taken in the quarter, we expect to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses by approximately 5% relative to a run rate exiting fiscal 22. Despite near-term headwinds, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Our leading technologies, such as advanced wireless connectivity; high-performance, low-power compute and on-device intelligence are enabling the ongoing trends of digital transformation across industries.From a product and technology perspective, we believe we are in the strongest position in our history. Our strategy is working, and we remain focused on expanding our addressable market to approximately $700 billion in the next decade and firmly establishing Qualcomm as the connected processor company for the intelligent edge. I will now provide key highlights from across our business. In automotive, the industry continues to evolve at an unprecedented rate, driven by the adoption of digital technologies. The software-defined vehicle is at the core of this transformation, offering automakers a significant opportunity to deliver enhanced connectivity, improved safety and security features, increased levels of autonomy as well as new business models and revenue streams.We believe the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is the industry's preferred purpose-built platform to help drive this innovation for the next generation of vehicles. At CES, we announced Snapdragon Ride Flex, which enables digital cockpit, advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving functions to coexist on a single SoC, a first for the automotive industry. Automakers and Tier 1s can now scale a unified center compute and software-defined vehicle architecture across their portfolio. We also demonstrated our expansion into two-wheelers with the latest infotainment and cloud connected digital services to enhance safety and deliver a more personal experience for riders. Our solutions also enable OEMs and fleet providers to deliver over-the-air updates, subscription services, remote diagnostics, geofencing, theft protection and more.We are very proud of the progress we have made in automotive, and we believe that we are the best positioned technology partner to help drive this industry into the future. In handsets, our recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform begins a new era of AI accelerated experiences for smartphones. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 includes our first ever AI-powered camera processor that enables real-time semantic segmentation for photos and videos. A dedicated 5G AI processor that can enhance 5G data speeds, coverage, latency and battery life and an updated general purpose AI engine with a larger tensor accelerator for increased formats. We are also pleased to enable the world's first satellite-based two-way capable messaging solution for Android smartphones.Snapdragon Satellite will provide global connectivity for messaging, utilizing Iridium's weather-resilient L-band spectrum and will initially be available on next-generation premium smartphones using Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 within the second half of 2023. Yesterday, I was pleased to join Samsung's Unpacked event, where they launched the Galaxy S23 family of smartphones, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform for Galaxy globally. This premium platform features accelerated performance and unique customizations made possible by our expanded strategic partnership with Samsung. The Galaxy S23 represents the first smartphone announced from this partnership. In IoT, which is poised to become our largest addressable market, our revenue stream spans across three categories: consumer, edge networking and industrial.In consumer IoT, our next-generation PC platform with integrated custom Oryon CPUs and upgraded AI engine has sampled on time and is exceeding our internal KPIs, delivering disruptive CPU performance per watt across tiers. In addition, Snapdragon's AI capabilities and leading battery life opens unique new possibilities for differentiated user experiences for the modern workforce. Key examples are Windows Studio Effects, including portrait blur, eye framing and noise cancellation with voice focus. Together with Microsoft, we're broadly engaged with the app ecosystem and are pleased that native applications have been launched for Windows on Snapdragon by market-leading ISVs such as Zoom, Amazon Prime Video, VMware Carbon Black, Cisco AnyConnect and CrowdStrike.Additionally, as Adobe announced at our Tech Summit, its creativity suite of apps, including Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Fresco and Acrobat will run natively on Snapdragon. We're now engaged with major PC OEMs with multiple platform design wins across their product road maps for consumer and commercial. In edge networking IoT our Wi-Fi infrastructure and networking products continue to gain share, led by strength in enterprise Wi-Fi access points and carrier gateways. We see several trends that are favorable to our Wi-Fi solutions. Wi-Fi mesh networking continues to grow in popularity worldwide, increasing the number of Wi-Fi chipsets installed per home. The hybrid work trend appears to have had lasting impacts on enterprise networking with workers relying on real-time collaboration tools regardless of whether they are in the office or remote.Broadband internet service providers are turning increasingly to a modular software development model, creating new opportunities for Qualcomm in next-generation home gateway routers, and the transition from Wi-Fi 6 and 6E to Wi-Fi 7, which we're currently leading across home, enterprise and carrier segments. In 5G, fixed wireless access, we're encouraged by the significant momentum in India following the recent 5G auctions. Operators have publicly stated their ambition to provide broadband services to 100 million homes using 5G FWA. Qualcomm is well positioned to enable the 5G FWA ecosystem in India with our leading product portfolio on 5G millimeter wave-based high-power CPEs complemented by small cell and compact macro cell infrastructure modem RF platforms.We are currently working with CPE and infrastructure OEMs on the commercial rollout in India, spanning both millimeter wave and sub-6 spectrum. In industrial IoT, digital transformation is still in the early phases, and the scale of the opportunity for Qualcomm in the long term across many verticals is significant. In the tracking and logistics space, we believe we have established one of the largest ecosystems of manufacturing partners. Last month, we announced a new IoT optimized modem, the QCX216 for applications such as smart utility meters, trackers, e-mobility, parking meters, home automation and security and other location-based solutions. The QCX216 reduces power consumption by up to 80% versus the previous generation solution while also enabling customers to design modules with an up to 40% lower cost structure.In retail, our point-of-sale solutions continue to drive the transition from traditional terminals to full-feature Android-based terminals. We have shipped over 70 million Snapdragon devices since 2016 into handheld and desktops point-of-sale terminals worldwide. In enterprise video collaboration, we're leading this rapidly growing segment, powering many of the key OEMs such as Poly, Logitech, Nit, Cisco, Bose, AVer and Alibaba. These are just a few examples of our traction within industrial, and we remain excited about the growth prospects as digital transformation accelerates. In summary, the overall long-term growth opportunity for Qualcomm remains unchanged as demand for technology extends to virtually every device at the edge. Our track record of innovation provides a unique perspective and capability to be at the forefront of the digital transformation across new and diverse end markets.I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.SoftwareAkash Palkhiwala: Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining our call during a busy earnings week. I'll start with our first fiscal quarter results. Consistent with our prior guidance, we delivered revenues of $9.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.37. QTL recorded revenues of $1.52 billion and EBT margin of 73%, reflecting slightly lower global handset units. QCT revenues were $7.9 billion and EBT margin was at the high end of our guidance range at 28%. Handset revenues of $5.8 billion reflected the impact of industry-wide headwinds we had previously communicated. IoT revenues were up 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, mainly driven by growth from our edge networking products. Automotive continued its momentum with year-over-year revenue growth of 58% to $456 million, driven by the adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis.Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than our guidance, decreasing 6% sequentially, which includes the benefit of certain cost actions we outlined last quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In addition, we expect to receive a majority of the transaction price of $1.5 billion on the completion of the sale of Veoneer's active safety business to Magna by SSW Partners. We expect the transaction to close by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.1 billion to stockholders, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $842 million in dividends, in line with our capital return program. Lastly, our GAAP EPS results included a $0.10 benefit from the U.S. tax requirement to capitalize and amortize R&amp;D expenses.This benefit is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I'll provide an update on short-term cyclical headwinds facing the semiconductor industry. The environment continues to be dynamic with challenging macroeconomic conditions and COVID headwinds in China, driving industry-wide demand weakness. Given this uncertainty, we are incorporating a negative bias for 3G, 4G, 5G handset volumes for calendar 23 relative to calendar 22. The impact of broadening demand weakness across handsets and IoT products and the easing of supply constraints has contributed to elevated channel inventory. Based on our current assessment, we expect QCT customers to continue to draw down on inventory, at least through the second and third fiscal quarters.At this point, we're optimistic that the demand and channel inventory may normalize during the second half of the calendar year, and we remain in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunity when it occurs. While our business is not immune to the macro environment, we are confident in our ability to navigate this landscape. As Cristiano summarized, we have continued to expand our actions to reduce operating expenses beyond the initiatives we previously outlined. While we are reducing spending on handsets and SG&amp;A, we continue to fund our diversification investments in IoT and automotive, which is consistent with our long-term strategy for the business. The initial benefit of these actions is reflected in our fiscal first quarter results and second quarter guidance.Overall, we are targeting a combined 5% reduction in non-GAAP operating expenses relative to our fiscal 22 exit rate. Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.7 billion to $9.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.05 to $2.25. The midpoint of our guidance includes an assumption of lower end market demand and the continued drawdown of channel inventory. We are forecasting QTL revenues of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion and EBT margins of 66% to 70%, reflecting a sequential seasonal decline in handset units. In QCT, we estimate revenues of $7.4 billion to $8 billion and EBT margins of 25% to 27%. We expect handsets and automotive revenue to be flat sequentially, offset by a reduction in IoT revenues due to the factors I just outlined.We estimate non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2.25 billion. This reflects the typical calendar year increases for certain employee-related costs, offset by the savings from our cost reduction actions. In closing, with the uncertainty of the macro environment, we will remain focused on operating discipline and managing the factors we control. Our diversification strategy is on track, as evidenced by our design win pipeline across IoT and automotive customers. In addition, our long-term secular growth opportunity remains unchanged. We are focused on executing on our strategy, enabled by our leading technology road map and best-in-class product portfolio. Thank you. Back to you, Mauricio.Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan: Thank you, Akash.

Operating profits were also under pressure. Really, this quarterly weakness driven by pressure on the handset business. That is, of course, things we've seen in the likes of Apple last night as well. IPhone sales are under pressure as well. But Citi's saying this is a difficult time in handsets. And if you take the handset business and the internet of things business for Qualcomm, that makes up about 77% of their fiscal first quarter sales what they just reported.- Yeah, and that's something that investors are looking to more and more, and the company has really touted more and more is outside of the handset business, what else is working? Initially, the Qualcomm shares actually went up after they reported their results. Automotive sales were up 58%. You mentioned connected devices I believe up 7%.However, if you're thinking about the overall revenue of the company's $9.46 billion, automotive sales is $456 million. Connected devices is $1.68 billion. In other words, yes, those areas are growing, but they're still very small as a proportion of the total company.- That's compared to an excess of $5.7 billion for the Q1 fiscal 2023.- For the handsets.- For handsets. Yeah, exactly. And so, really thinking about how they continue to not just move more into the automotive landscape, or at least kind of lessen the dependency on that handset business knowing how much Apple, how much Samsung, how much some of the other manufacturers have proven that they are ready to throw their weight around and, perhaps, have a little bit more vertical integration.That's a red flag for Qualcomm, right now at least. And so, just a larger question of where you continue to have that demand generated in this near term as well, given the shift that you've seen from some of those large historical purchasers from the business too.]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Expedia (EXPE) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.99 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 9, 2023.EXPE has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.34%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85.EXPE is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Wingstop (WING) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Wingstop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 22, 2023. WING's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.42 a share 19 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wingstop is $0.41, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.51%.Story continuesEXPE and WING's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Per the agreement, the company aims to repurchase $500 million of the common stock.The agreement is part of Northrop’s intent to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2023, signifying business strength and the ability to continue generating profits and return excess cash to shareholders. NOC expects to complete the transaction by the second quarter of 2023.Can NOC Continue to Boost Shareholder Return?Northrop’s commitment to returning 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders is backed by the consistent order inflow, a strong backlog, rising product demand and its ability to deliver products that address an increasingly complex security environment.These factors boost the company’s cash flow generation capacity, thus enabling it to bolster shareholder return. In this context, it is imperative to mention that NOC’s backlog at the end of 2022 increased 4% from 2021, reflecting the company’s capability to steadily perform and generate cash.Additionally, Northrop’s bottom line improved 25% year over year, while its sales increased by 16% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022, signifying increased profitability and higher demand for products. This enables the company to cheer investors with increased dividends and share repurchases.The company increased its dividend by 10% in 2022, which was the 19th consecutive increase. NOC delivered more than $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases.Going forward, Northrop expects sales in the range of $38-$38.4 billion in 2023, suggesting about 4.5% growth from the 2022 reported figure at the midpoint. Adjusted earnings are projected in the range of $21.85-$22.45 per share.The company expects adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.85-$2.15 billion in 2023. This implies an increase of 25% from the 2022 reported figure at the midpoint.Story continuesMoreover, NOC’s capital deployment plan supports its business strategy. In 2022, the company invested more than 7% of revenues in Research &amp; Development and capital expenditures to enhance the capability and capacity of its products, capitalizing on the growing demand through improvised products and augmenting its earnings prospects and the ability to generate excess cash.Backed by such business strength and financial stability, one may expect Northrop to continue to bolster shareholder returns. Moreover, the recent increase in defense spending by the U.S. government and its allies may provide an edge to the company to amplify its returns and shareholder return.Peer MovesDefense companies that have enhanced their share repurchase program or increased dividends for shareholders to show financial strength are as follows:Lockheed Martin LMT delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 through share repurchases of $7.9 billion and paid out dividends of $3 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program and retired approximately seven million shares under the agreement.The long-term earnings growth rate of LMT is pegged at 6.9%. Shares of Lockheed Martin have increased 19.2% in the past year.In December 2022, Raytheon Technologies RTX authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of the outstanding common stock. The new authorization replaces the company's previous program.RTX has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%. Raytheon’s shares have delivered 19.2% in the past year.In October 2022, L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:WEC) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 2, 2023Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year End 22 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with these statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. The replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.Gale Klappa : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for calendar year 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2022 earnings of $4.45 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes. But I'm pleased to report to you that we delivered an exceptional year on virtually every meaningful measure from employee safety and customer satisfaction to growth in earnings per share.Story continuesThree major factors really shaped our strong results for 2022: favorable weather; solid performance from our infrastructure and transmission segments; and steady execution of our capital plan, as we paved the way for an energy future that's affordable, reliable, and clean. On the regulatory front, as you may know, we saw balanced and credit supportive results from our Wisconsin rate reviews in December, despite a little bit of noise in the process. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And last month, on January 6th, we filed rate requests with the Illinois Commerce Commission for our gas utilities in Illinois. I would point out that home heating bills in Chicago are currently below those of other major U.S. cities, like New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.And we expect that to continue with this filing. Scott will provide you with more detail in just a moment. Turning now to our ESG progress plan that we updated for you in November. It's the largest five-year investment plan in our history, totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability, and growth. We expect the plan to drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the period 2023 through 2027. The key part of the plan is a major commitment to renewable projects, both in our regulated business and in our infrastructure segment. In fact, earlier this week, we announced that our infrastructure group will acquire an 80% ownership interest in Phase 1 of the Samson Solar Energy Center. Located in Northeast Texas, Samson I has a capacity of 250 megawatts.It entered commercial service in May of last year and has a long-term power purchase agreement with AT&amp;T. Pending final regulatory approval, we plan to invest approximately $250 million for our portion of Samson I. We expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter of this year. Samson I, as you may know, is the first of 5 phases being developed by Invenergy. Overall, Samson is the largest solar project under construction in the United States today, and we're pleased to take part in Phase 1. Now, as you know, one of our goals is to help shape the future of clean energy. And today, we're announcing an important pilot project with the Electric Power Research Institute and a company called CMBlu Energy. CMBlu is a German designer of long duration battery storage using common low-cost, environmentally-friendly materials.In simple English, it's a green battery. This 1 to 2 megawatt hour pilot project will be one of the first of its kind on the United States electric grid. Our plan is to test the durability of this battery system. We believe it can store energy for up to twice as long as the typical batteries in use today. We plan to launch the project at our Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee in the fourth quarter of this year when temperatures turn cold. The results will be shared in early 2024 across the industry. And now, let's switch gears and take a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 52,000 private sector jobs in 2022, and in December, the unemployment rate in the state dropped to 3.2%. That's well below the national average. We believe the current strength and remarkable diversity of the Wisconsin economy positions us well as we move forward in 2023.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations, and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.Scott Lauber: Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand for the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The commission authorized return on equity of 9.8% for all our Wisconsin utilities. It approved an increase in the equity component of our capital structure to 53%. We'll also continue the earning sharing mechanism to provide benefits to Wisconsin customers if our performance exceeds our forecast. And as Gail mentioned, we now have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. At Peoples Gas, we are not seeking an extension of the automatic bill adjustment rider known as QIP, after it expires at the end of this year.We plan to return to the traditional rate making process to recover the cost of necessary infrastructure improvements. Our rate request would continue to support those key capital investments. Peoples Gas operates one of the oldest natural gas delivery networks in the United States. And as you may recall, an independent engineering study found that over 80% of the iron pipes in the system are approaching the end of their useful life. We are modernizing the system to ensure safety and reliability and to reduce methane emissions. With natural gas prices declining, we project customer bills will remain largely flat as the new rates take effect in 2024. You may also recall we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources last November.We are seeking an overall increase of 8.1%, primarily driven by capital investments. Interim rates went into effect January 1st. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of our regulatory capital projects. Our Red Barn wind development is on track to come online within the next few months in Wisconsin with an expected investment of $160 million. This project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system. Work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect the solar parks to go into service this year, assuming timely release of the panels. We also received regulatory approval for our purchase of the Darien Solar-Battery Park, with plans for 225 megawatts of solar capacity and 68 megawatts of battery storage.We expect this facility to go into service in 2024. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. And just last month with an investment of approximately $75 million, we closed our purchase of the Whitewater combined cycle plant, a 236 megawatt facility. As a reminder, we previously received energy and capacity from this natural gas unit under a purchase power agreement. In the natural gas business we have been working to bring high quality renewable natural gas to our customers. We signed another contract in January, which brings us to a planned total of 1 billion cubic feet of RNG that'll enter our system annually. We expect RNG to flow this year, supporting our aggressive goals to reduce methane emissions. Outside our utilities, we continue to make good progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment.The Thunderhead Wind Farm in Nebraska is now in service. In addition, we expect to complete the acquisition of Sapphire Sky in Illinois in the coming weeks as commercial operation begins. And as Gale noted, we're excited about our plans to add the Samson I solar project in our infrastructure segment before the end of the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.Suwin/Shutterstock.comGale Klappa: Great, Scott. Thank you very much. We're confident that we can deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023. As you recall, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share. The midpoint $4.60 a share represents growth of 6.7% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And as we've discussed, we expect to fund our capital plan without any need to issue equity. And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so you can expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.Xia Liu: Thanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2022 earnings of $4.45 per share increased $0.34 per share or 8.3% compared to 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2022 results on page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.19 compared to 2021. Weather drove a $0.04 increase in earnings compared to 2021. Rate base growth contributed $0.41 to earnings, and lower day-to-day O&amp;M expense resulted in a $0.02 improvement and achieved our goal for the year. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense related to continued capital investment and a $0.12 increase in fuel expense, mainly driven by higher natural gas costs.In terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.1%. Small commercial and industrial sales increased 0.5%, while residential and large commercial and industrial sales stayed relatively flat. Overall, our sales mix was stronger than our forecast. Our sales projections for 2023 can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the earnings package. Overall, we are projecting relatively flat electric and gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.07 compared to 2021. If you recall, $0.05 related to the resolution of historical appeals that we discussed on our third quarter earnings call. As previously discussed, beginning with the third quarter of 2022 and going forward, we are recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity.Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.14 in 2022 compared to 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits as a result of stronger wind production and the addition of our Jayhawk wind farm that went into commercial operation at the end of 2021. In addition, recall that we recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution earlier in 2022 from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and lower gains recognized on our investment in the clean energy fund. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&amp;M. Overall, we improved on our 2021 performance by $0.34 per share.Looking now at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $28 million. And total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.7 billion in 2022, a $324 million increase as compared to 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan. Finally, let's look at our earnings guidance. In terms of first quarter 2023 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.72 per share. This forecast takes into account the fourth warmest January on record since the 1880s and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Remember, last year, we earned $1.79 per share in the first quarter, which included $0.02 of favorable weather, $0.03 from the Southwest Power Pool settlement and $0.03 from our investment in the clean energy fund.And for the full year 2023, we're reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. We're also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the next five years. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.Gale Klappa: Xia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call.See also 12 Best One Dollar Stocks To Buy and 13 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:WEC) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.78 on the 1st of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.3%. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, WEC Energy Group's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 18.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 61% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.12. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 10% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.We Could See WEC Energy Group's Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that WEC Energy Group has grown earnings per share at 7.4% per year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.In SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think WEC Energy Group's payments are rock solid. While WEC Energy Group is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ALE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ALE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.35, while WEC has a forward P/E of 20.68.

If you want to see more best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.Value stocks are stocks of companies generally considered trading below what many investors think they are worth. Because different investors could view a stock differently, what a stock is worth is subjective. Some investors might view a stock as a value stock while others might find the same stock expensive.To find value stocks, we chose stocks that are included in the The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV).According to the ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) 'seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&amp;P® 500 Value Index (the “Index”).The S&amp;P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value segment in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price ratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.'Value stocks can decline as stocks can always trade for lower than what investors think they are worth. As a ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) declined as a whole last year and it could decline this year if economic data doesn't meet estimates.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. When companies have excess capital, many decide to return the excess capital through a stock buyback or by paying a dividend.When profits change, dividends can change. In good times, many companies increase their dividend when their profits increase. In more difficult times, many companies lower their dividends or suspend them altogether.In terms of the economy in 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of being a little stronger than some expected in terms of Q4 GDP. Inflation has also shown signs of potentially peaking last year.Story continuesIn terms of the effect of increased interest rates on inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on February 1, 2023, ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far.""Nevertheless, Powell also said, ""It would be very premature to declare victory, or to think that we’ve really got this.""If economic data doesn't meet estimates, stocks could always decline, including the best value stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy, we selected value stocks from the 407 holdings of the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) as of February 2, 2023.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they paid dividends and that they had considerable earnings growth potential in the next ten years if they maintained their market share.We then sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy13.

(NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

171,97e57dc0-e4f6-3910-8819-ece91cee4643,RSG,2023-02-04,The 7 Best ‘Waste’ Stocks for Dumpster-Diving Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-waste-stocks-dumpster-224432364.html,1675205072.0,STORY,"['WCN', 'CNM', 'WM', 'RSG', 'QRHC', 'CLH']","[Although waste stocks to buy might not represent the first avenue for most investors seeking profits in a possibly resurgent market cycle, it might be among the most logical. With the pace of inflation slowing, consumer spending may rise relative to last year. If so, greater consumption would translate to more waste products, bolstering the dumpster-diving sector.Another factor that could potentially lift waste management stocks centers on the lack of alternatives. Just because you throw your trash products per their appropriate compartments, the act itself doesn’t really mean anything. Companies in this specialty must still pick up your rubbish and dispose of it some way, somehow.Plus, this particular segment of the management industry covers many areas, from residential trash to wastewater services. Fundamentally, it’s a permanently relevant sector – appropriate for both good times and bad. On that note, below are waste management stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMWaste Management$154.73WCNWaste Connections$132.90RSGRepublic Services$124.82CLHClean Harbors$130.30AMBPArmagh Metal Packaging$5.62CNMCore &amp; Main$22.07QRHCQuest Resource$6.90Waste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comObviously, we can’t have a discussion about waste management stocks without mentioning Waste Management (NYSE:WM). As with other publicly traded securities, WM didn’t enjoy the best performance in 2022. Presently, shares gained only a bit more than 1% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, that’s a much better performance than the benchmark S&amp;P 500, which dropped nearly 10% during the same period.Fundamentally, this slow-and-steady approach symbolizes why investors appreciate Waste Management. Whether a bull market, bear market or something in between, people will continue to generate waste products. Someone has to step in and take care of the constant buildup, providing predictability in the company’s revenue channels.Story continuesPresently, Wall Street analysts rate WM as a consensus hold, which doesn’t particularly sound encouraging. However, their average price target of $169.20 implies nearly 11% upside potential. Even better, hedge fund sentiment rates as very positive. Therefore, investors should look into WM as one of the waste management stocks to buy.Waste Connections (WCN)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockProviding garbage pickup and dumpster rental services for businesses in the U.S. and Canada, Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN) should enjoy significant upside if the broader economy normalizes. If not, the company will still command relevance, which makes waste management stocks such an intriguing idea. What’s more, WCN specifically gained over 5% in the trailing year, underscoring its demand predictability.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, WCN rates as significantly undervalued. Objectively, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1%, beating out over 60% of the competition. On the bottom line, Waste Connection’s net margin pings at 11.6%, above 75% of sector players. About the only major weakness is its balance sheet, which overall features middling stability.Nevertheless, perhaps the most important takeaway centers on Wall Street’s assessment. Per covering experts, WCN rates as a consensus (and unanimous) strong buy. Also, their average price target implies potential upside of 15%, making WCN one of the waste management stocks to consider.Republic Services (RSG)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA competitor to Waste Management and Waste Connections in the disposal service segment, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) did take a hit compared to other companies in the field. In the trailing year, RSG slipped 3% of equity value. However, in the past five years, RSG shot up 81.5%, beating out the former two waste management stocks.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, RSG features a modestly undervalued profile. To be fair, sales growth slipped in 2020, impacting the longer-term trajectory. However, in the third quarter of 2022, Republic posted revenue of nearly $3.6 billion, up roughly 23% against the year-ago period. Moreover, the company enjoys solid profit margins. In particular, its net margin of 11.2% beat out over 73% of its rivals.Presently, Wall Street analysts rate RSG as a consensus moderate buy. Conspicuously, their average price target implies upside potential of almost 18%. That’s quite robust for waste management stocks, making it worthy of consideration.Clean Harbors (CLH)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Norwell, Massachusetts, Clean Harbors (NYSE:CLH) provides environmental and industrial services, including hazardous waste disposal for companies. The enterprises Clean Harbors serve include Fortune 500 entities, small waste generators and federal, state, provincial and local governments. If you think it’s a relevant business, you’d be right. In the trailing year, CLH gained a whopping 38%.Better yet, it’s still going strong, moving up 12% in the year so far. Now, because of the enormous price hike, Gurufocus.com rates CLH as fairly valued. Still, it offers some potent stats. For instance, the company’s three-year free-cash-flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 20.8%, exceeding over 67% of industry competitors. Also, its return on equity (ROE) of over 23% reflects an extremely high-quality business enterprise.Currently, Wall Street analysts rate CLH as a consensus strong buy. It would have been unanimous save for one hold rating. Also, their average price target of $140 implies upside potential of 10%. Thus, it still has legs as one of the waste management stocks to buy.Ardagh Metal Packaging (AMBP)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA leading global supplier of sustainable, infinitely recyclable, metal beverage cans to brand owners, Ardagh Metal Packaging (NYSE:AMBP) might not be a household name here in the U.S. However, as global populations rise and broader consumption habits increase, sustainability will become a critical issue. To be sure, investors didn’t see it that way in 2022, with AMBP losing 42% in the trailing year. Still, in the new year, it’s up almost 11%.On the fiscal side, Ardagh carries notable risks. Objectively, the market prices AMBP at nearly 15-times forward earnings. That’s conspicuously higher than the industry median of 12 times. Also, its balance sheet could use some work. Nevertheless, on the optimistic front, Ardagh’s ROE stands at a stratospheric 65%. This indicates superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits.Presently, Wall Street analysts rate AMBP as a consensus moderate buy. Just as importantly, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment for Ardagh pings as very positive. For risk takers, AMBP could be one of the waste management stocks to buy.Core &amp; Main (CNM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBased in Missouri, Core &amp; Main (NYSE:CNM) is a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products, and related services in the U.S. At the moment, the company operates approximately 300 branches nationwide. Despite relevancies as one of the indirect waste management stocks to buy, CNM slipped nearly 10% in the trailing year.However, that doesn’t appear to be the main storyline for Core &amp; Main. In the year so far, CNM gained 11% of equity value. Even better, the company enjoys a series of attractive fiscal attributes. First, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.5%, above over 85% of the competition. Second, it’s a profitable enterprise, featuring a net margin of 5.52% (above 65% of rivals).As a bonus, the market prices CNM at a forward multiple of 10. In contrast, the sector median pings at 14.8. Finally, Wall Street analysts rate CNM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target implies upside potential of nearly 29%, making CNM one of the waste management stocks to consider.Quest Resource Holding (QRHC)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhile a relative unknown among waste management stocks, Quest Resource Holding (NASDAQ:QRHC) deserves closer examination. Per its website, Quest Resource manages companies’ operational waste streams by delivering tailored waste solutions that increase efficiencies, maximize landfill diversion, improve their bottom line and help meet business and sustainability goals. In the trailing year, QRHC gained slightly over 5%.Even more impressive, since the January opener, QRHC jumped up 10%. To be sure, prospective investors will require significant belief in the underlying narrative. For instance, the company’s Altman Z-Score sits in the distressed zone. As well, on a trailing-12-month basis, Quest’s net margin is in negative territory.Still, that’s not the whole story. Currently, the market prices QRHC at a forward multiple of 14.14. And it also prices shares at a trailing sales multiple of 0.48. Both stats come in under their respective sector median values. Finally, Wall Street pegs QRHC as a consensus moderate buy. Further, with an average price target of $12.50, the implication is that shares will nearly double from here.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

A federal appeals court dismissed J&amp;J’s JNJ bankruptcy filing related to its talc lawsuits. The European Commission approved Sanofi SNY and Regeneron’s Dupixent for a new indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEarnings Update: Pfizer’s fourth-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Pfizer issued its financial guidance for 2023.Revenues are expected in the range of $67.0 to $71.0 billion, indicating an operational decline of 29%-33% from the 2022 level. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, reflecting an operational decline of 48%-51% from the 2022 level. However, Pfizer’s 2023 outlook fell well below market expectations due to steep declines expected in revenues from its COVID-19 products as a result of lower demand. Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer expects its revenues to rise 7% to 9% on an operational basis in 2023.Merck’s fourth-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Sales of its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Lagevrio were better than expected backed by higher demand in outside U.S. market. Though sales of key products cancer drug, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine rose in the quarter, they were less than our expectations. Keytruda sales of $5.45 billion rose 19% year over year while sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 6% year over year in the year.Merck issued a fresh earnings and sales outlook for 2023. Merck expects revenues to be in the range of $57.2 - $58.7 billion in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $6.80 and $6.95.Lilly reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating earnings estimates but missing on sales. Sales rose 9% year over year due to higher sales of key drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance and others and contribution from the recently approved diabetes drug, Mounjaro. Lilly revised the financial guidance for 2023, which it provided in December 2022, reiterating the revenue guidance range of $30.3 billion and $30.8 billion while increasing its earnings expectations from $8.10-$8.30 to $8.35-$8.55 per share.Story continuesNovartis’ fourth-quarter results were also mixed. It beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues. Sales in the Innovative Medicines unit rose 3% at constant currency, driven by the strong growth of products like Entresto, Kesimpta, Pluvicto and Kisqali. Sales in the Sandoz division were flat as higher volumes were offset by lower price. The company issued its financial guidance for 2023. It expects sales to grow in the low-to-mid single-digit range and core operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit range in 2023.Novo Nordisk also beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues.

J&amp;J faces numerous lawsuits, which allege that its baby powder and other talc products contain asbestos that causes cancer. LTL Management, which was established to manage claims in the cosmetic talc litigation, filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection in North Carolina to resolve J&amp;J’s talc-related claims in 2021. The J&amp;J subsidiary is now prevented from transferring over 38,000 claims for its talc-based products out of trial courts and into a bankruptcy court. The appeals court believes that LTL Management was solely created to file for Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) protection. The court stated that only a debtor in financial distress can seek protection under bankruptcy laws.Per the precedent passed by the appeals court, LTL Management is backed by J&amp;J, an entity with a triple-A-rated payment obligation and holds billions in cash reserves, and therefore has ample financial resources to fulfil such claims.FDA Approves Lilly’s New Lymphoma Drug, Jaypirca: The FDA granted accelerated approval to Lilly’s BTK inhibitor, pirtobrutinib (100 mg &amp; 50 mg tablets) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma in adult patients previously treated with at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor.

The approval was based on data from the phase I/II BRUIN study, which showed that treatment with Jaypirca led to an overall response rate of 50% in the abovementioned patient group, with 13% of patients achieving a complete response. Jaypirca is the second of five new medicines that Lilly expects to launch by 2023 end. The other product already launched is Mounjaro for type II diabetes.Sanofi/Regeneron’s Dupixent Gets EU Approval for Eosinophilic Esophagitis: The European Commission approved Sanofi and Regeneron blockbuster medicines, Dupixent (dupilumab) for treating adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory disease.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at 5 Biggest Industrial Software Companies in the World.The industrial software industry is a rapidly growing field, driven by the need to stay ahead of the curve in industrial process optimization. Technology is being used to automate and streamline manufacturing operations, with the ultimate goal of maximizing efficiency and reducing costs. Industrial software products can range from simple data tracking and analysis platforms to complex process control systems that utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence.The industrial software industry is also changing the way companies think about their operations. By leveraging the power of industrial software, companies can create a data-driven culture that is focused on continuous improvement. This shift in mindset can help companies gain a competitive edge by improving their operational efficiency and reducing costs. Today, industrial software is used in a variety of industries, ranging from manufacturing and engineering to power generation and healthcare.An Analysis of the Global Industrial Software Industry: Size, Drivers, Challenges, and Regional InsightsAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global industrial software market was worth $92.58 billion in 2021, and is expected to grow to $157.41 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 9.25% from 2022 through 2027.The industrial software market is experiencing expansion due to the increasing popularity of industrial cloud computing technology. With cloud computing, IT services are accessible via web-based applications instead of connecting to a server directly. Industrial cloud computing allows the transmission of data to the software programs that automate workflows and the applications used on computers or mobile devices. Additionally, the growth of the market is attributed to various factors, such as the rise in spending on software, the development of industry 4.0, the increasing need for operational efficiency, the growing electronics industry, and the digital transformation of businesses.Story continuesMoreover, the industrial software market is expected to grow due to the integration of AI with industrial software, the rising adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and the implementation of digital twins. Businesses use digital twins to reduce equipment failure risk and automate repairs. This leads to scalable, cost-effective, and agile supply chain operations.However, there are some challenges the global industrial software industry is faced with. These include hefty initial investments and cybersecurity. While the integration of cloud, mobile, IoT, and AI streamlines industrial processes, it also creates greater security, compliance, and data protection challenges. IoT and cloud computing help industrial software run smoothly but these technologies also make data more vulnerable to getting hacked.According to the Research and Markets, North America held the largest market share of the industrial software market in 2021 due to increasing adoption of industrial software by SMEs, and the increased investments by vendors in tech-driven software. The Asia Pacific region is expected to expand over the forecasted period due to a booming manufacturing industry and SMEs. Additionally, government support for IT infrastructure in the region is expected to fuel market growth further.The industrial software industry is expected to continue to grow as companies continue to look for ways to improve their operations. As technology advances, the demand for more efficient and effective industrial software solutions will increase. As a result, companies are investing in new software products and solutions to help them meet the growing demand for industrial software.

179,b42ac53f-de9f-3d8c-828b-b8a4a26d0ef6,ROK,2023-02-04,4 Stocks With Sales Growth for Guaranteed Returns in 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-sales-growth-guaranteed-124412432.html,1675428252,STORY,"['ROK', 'ALK', 'CBOE', 'DE']","[After a highly disappointing 2022, this year has started on a solid note. All three major indexes – the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – ended the first month of 2023 in green. But to think the macroeconomic concerns have faded is wrong. While the recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary about entering the stock market, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. Hence, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Deere &amp; Company DE, Rockwell Automation, Inc. ROK, Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE and Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK are worth considering.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more scrutinized than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continued bottom-line expansion usually requires strong sales growth.Yet, sales growth alone doesn’t show much about a company’s prospects. Hence, taking into account a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a practical investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Selecting the Potential Winning StocksTo shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow of more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Illinois-based Deere is the world’s largest producer of agricultural equipment, manufacturing agricultural machinery under the iconic John Deere brand name. DE is currently the world leader in precision agriculture and remains focused on revolutionizing agriculture with technology.Deere’s expected sales growth rate for 2023 is 13.5%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.Rockwell Automation, based in Milwaukee, WI, provides industrial automation and information solutions worldwide. ROK has a wide network spanning more than 100 countries.Rockwell Automation’s expected sales growth rate for fiscal 2023 is 10.9%.

180,46c6f506-cac9-34a8-b3c6-bb559fbfea9e,WMB,2023-02-04,Williams Companies' (NYSE:WMB) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-nyse-wmb-upcoming-122549100.html,1675513549,STORY,['WMB'],"[The board of The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 5.3% on the 27th of March to $0.4475, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.425. The payment will take the dividend yield to 5.3%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies Williams Companies' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, Williams Companies' profits didn't cover the dividend, but the company was generating enough cash instead. Generally, we think cash is more important than accounting measures of profit, so with the cash flows easily covering the dividend, we don't think there is much reason to worry.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 25.7% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 82% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.historic-dividendWilliams Companies Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.70. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.5% a year over that time. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.Williams Companies' Dividend Might Lack GrowthInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Williams Companies has grown earnings per share at 23% per year over the past five years. EPS has been growing well, but Williams Companies has been paying out a massive proportion of its earnings, which can make the dividend tough to maintain.In SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Williams Companies' payments are rock solid. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Williams Companies (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Russian forces used Belarus as a launch pad for their abortive attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, at the start of the war nearly a year ago but Belarus has ruled out joining the conflict.Havas said the Turkish aviation industry received warning letters from the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the letter was to respond to U.S. export controls related to the Ukraine war.""In that respect, we are running a due-dilligence process to identify risks and consequences to our business and stakeholders. As a result of this, we may find ourselves unable to serve some or all of your flights,"" the Havas letter said.As part of sweeping Western sanctions and export controls on Moscow, the United States restricted licensing, parts and services - from new airframes and engines to cupholders and fuel - on planes of U.S. origin like Boeing jets, or that contain up to 25% U.S. materials.Havas asked Russian and Belarusian airlines for a list of aircraft that contain less than 25% of U.S. origin technology, advising them to plan flights to be operated with those planes.Havas will only serve aircraft that contain less than 25% of U.S. origin technology, in the case that U.S. authorities issue an order denying export privileges to the airline operating the flight, it said.Havas, Turkey's largest airport ground services provider, operates in many airports including the biggest cities Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Antalya.In December, officials from the U.S. administration held a two-day workshop in Turkey to warn Turkish companies that they could be breaching U.S. war-time restrictions on Moscow when they provide an array of services to arriving Russian aircraft including handling, refuelling and new parts at airports.

At a time when advances in technology and medicine can make a real difference, far too many regions and populations are still left out.Initiated in 2000 by the Union for International Cancer Control, World Cancer Day on February 4 is a time to advocate for change and rally support for a global community of oncology patients, families, advocates, volunteers, educators, doctors, and researchers. The 2023 campaign theme, ""Close the care gap,"" focuses on equity and accessibility.According to Illumina's chief medical officer, Phil Febbo (himself an oncologist), doctors are painfully aware of the barriers, gaps, and inequities barring progress for patients. ""In the cancer clinic, it is heartbreaking when we run out of treatment options for patients,"" he says. ""It's ten times worse when cancer patients don't have access to existing treatments. I left clinical practice and joined Illumina to improve the standard of care and ensure all cancer patients, regardless of their demographic or location, have access to technologies and treatments that improve outcomes.""On this World Cancer Day, we at Illumina want to recognize a few of the many ways our friends, collaborators, and partners around the globe are working to close the cancer care gap:By bringing screening to Malaysia's rural populationsDr. Melissa Lim Siaw Han, university lecturer/researcher and founding member and committee member of SCAN; Kuching, Malaysia:""At the Society for Cancer Advocacy and AwareNess (SCAN) Kuching, I am closing the cancer care gap by ensuring that the marginalized population of Sarawak [a state in Malaysia] is not left behind. Rural populations are usually diagnosed at later stages and less likely to receive timely, let alone appropriate, treatments to ensure their chance at survival. It is our duty as patient organizations to ensure that ‘Where you live should not determine if you live.'Story continues""One of our recent pilot projects of an early breast cancer detection outreach program was to Kampung Rantau Panjang on December 10, 2022. Twenty-seven women from the small village turned up for the screening. We focus on breast cancer clinical examination, breast cancer awareness education, high blood pressure, and blood sugar testing. Most Malaysian women living far away from the city are of lower education level and do not receive proper awareness about breast cancer. They are afraid to find out about breast cancer due to their fear of losing their husbands if they fall sick or lose their breasts. We hope to one day diminish this stigma by educating all women that ‘early detection saves lives,' and often, also their breasts.""By providing accessible information in BrazilSimone Lehwess Mozzilli, founder and CEO, Instituto Beaba, São Paulo, Brazil:""Beaba is an institute with the mission of demystifying cancer and informing patients in an accessible and appropriate way about the disease and treatment, so our main pillars to close the care gap are based on information, communication, and education. Beaba created educational tools, such as the guide ""Beaba of Cancer,"" distributed free of charge to children and adolescents in oncologic treatment. We inform and engage patients and their families, increasing adherence to their care and improving the quality of life.""The scientifically validated material has already been distributed to more than 13,000 patients in more than 150 institutions throughout Brazil, which are trained to use the material. The next step will be the development and validation of the guide in Braille, with the support of Illumina.""By advocating for early prevention in the USJody Hoyos, CEO, Prevent Cancer Foundation, Alexandria, Virginia (US):""The Prevent Cancer Foundation is closing the care gap by advocating for access to new innovations in early detection, such as multi-cancer early detection (MCED) screening tests. Right now, the gap in routine cancer screening is a big one. Routine screening is available for only five types of cancer, which leaves the vast majority of cancers without available screening tests. When it comes to cancer, it's so important to have time on your side-when cancer is detected early, nine of every 10 cancer patients will live five years or longer.""MCED is a groundbreaking new type of cancer screening test that utilizes advances in genomic science and machine learning to transform cancer detection. The Prevent Cancer Foundation has been leading more than 400 organizations in advocating for these tests so there will be a pathway in place for Medicare coverage once the tests are approved by the FDA and shown to have clinical benefit. We want seniors, who are at increased risk of cancer because of their age, to have access to these tests as soon as possible.""By supporting adolescent and young adult patients in SingaporeDr. Eileen Poon Yi Ling, consultant, Adolescents and Young Adults Oncology (AYAO) Singapore Programme, National Cancer Centre Singapore:""At National Cancer Centre Singapore - Adolescent and Young Adults Oncology (AYAO), we are closing the care gap by actively seeking to improve the dearth of age-appropriate education for our cancer patients [ages 16 to 39] and health care workers. We have done this by holding our public webinars in the last two years, and just concluding our inaugural international AYAO symposium for health care workers. We will also be launching our mobile application this year to bridge the information gap for our patients!""By changing the standard of care in IrelandProfessor Owen Smith CBE, University College Dublin and principal investigator, National Children's Research Centre:""It was a true pleasure to have been involved in shaping the National Strategy for accelerating genetic and genomic medicine in Ireland. It is now entering the implementation phase, and with all the best will in the world it will take a number of years to be fully realized. In the meantime, we are about to embark on a research study looking at combined whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing (WGTS) in parallel to standard-of-care on all children and young adolescents (zero to 16 years) with cancer in Ireland, to see if the WGTS can replace current testing. This study has taken a number of years in planning with colleagues in health service, academia, and industry. My commitment to this study has been 100%, as I believe WGTS will be the new standard of care for child, adolescent, and young adult cancer.""By instituting precision oncology in SwedenFelix Haglund de Flon, associate professor, clinical pathologist; Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden:""I'm closing the care gap by establishing comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with sarcoma treated at the Karolinska University Hospital. It is a great team effort including doctors, nurses, scientists, and patients to push our understanding of the sarcoma genome and its impact on diagnostics and treatment.""Visit the World Cancer Day website to learn more, find an organization to support, and join us in thanking our partners and friends. ""I applaud these organizations for their work in closing the cancer care gap,"" Febbo adds.

If you want to read about some more hot insurance stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Hot Insurance Stocks To Buy Now.The insurance industry had a challenging year in 2022, with the COVID-19 pandemic leading to an increase in claims for areas such as business interruption and pandemic insurance. Even before 2020, the insurance sector was facing challenges. These challenges then became even more pressing in the year 2022. The 2nd largest insurance company, Ping An Insurance (China), was valued at around $140 billion by the end of 2022, and the price of its stock fell by –6.74% which is quite good compared to the rest of the market. The total insurance industry was worth $1.4 trillion at end of 2022.In 2023, the insurance industry is expected to recover, with a focus on digital transformation and the use of data and analytics. A report by PwC predicts that the insurance industry will invest heavily in technology in 2023. The proliferation of digital platforms, the expansion of distribution channels through strategic alliances and integration options, and the improvement of data analysis are bringing markets together. The availability of regulatory choices will continue to increase and obstacles to market entry will become less of an issue.According to McKinsey, the 2023 outlook remains favorable as a growing number of individuals are recognizing their personal responsibility for their health and retirement expenses. As government debt in developed economies rises and funding shortfalls occur in public health and retirement programs (e.g. Social Security in the US and National Pension System in Japan), a $41 trillion shortfall in global pensions has emerged. Despite this challenge, the industry presents opportunities for insurance providers.Overall, the systemic risk within the insurance industry remains at a moderate level in 2023. However, there is a growing upward trend in the total systemic risk assessments of insurance companies, largely due to elevated exposures to assets that are illiquid, hard to determine in value, and involve over-the-counter derivatives, short-term funding, and intra-financial assets. In 2021, the solvency and financial performance of insurers improved due to favorable conditions in financial markets. However, since 2022, rising geopolitical tensions, inflation, stricter monetary policies, and a deteriorating economic outlook have led to a rise in market, credit, and liquidity risks.Story continuesAccording to experts, Blockchain can benefit insurance companies through cost savings, improved efficiency, increased transparency, and better product and market development. Blockchain enables the real-time sharing of data among parties in a secure and verifiable manner and can also facilitate new insurance practices. The adoption of blockchain represents an opportunity for positive change and growth in the competitive insurance industry. Some of the top insurance stocks to monitor in this context include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET).It’s not surprising that AI can bring about change in the insurance industry as well. According to Forbes, AI will play a major role in transforming the insurance industry. As AI becomes more popular, it is becoming an increasingly important tool for companies in the sector. The use of AI can help companies analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, allowing them to make more informed decisions. The integration of technology, data, AI, and modern design has created a formidable force that is transforming the traditionally policy-focused industry into one that prioritizes the customer experience.Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify insurance stocks that have gained at least 15% year to date in 2023. From this resultant dataset we picked the stocks with highest share price gains. We reported the number of hedge funds in each of these stocks, so you can determine which insurance stocks that hedge funds think are the best investments. The list is ranked in ascending order of year-to-date performance of each stock. 10 Hot Insurance Stocks To Buy Nowaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashHot Insurance Stocks To Buy Now10.

Quote Skyworks’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 2.13% on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Likely to Have Influenced Q1 PerformanceRobust uptake of 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E solutions is likely to have driven Skyworks’ top line in the fiscal first quarter. Demand has been driven by a growing need for high-speed connectivity amid the pandemic-induced surge in hybrid work environments, video-streaming and web-based learning trends.Accelerated 5G deployment globally has been a tailwind for Skyworks. Emerging use cases of 5G in end-markets like automotive and industrial IoT, and technologies like virtual reality, gaming and telemedicine are expected to have driven demand for Skyworks’ 5G solutions.Moreover, momentum for Skyworks’ bulk acoustic wave (""BAW"") filters, particularly in mobile and broad markets, is likely to have driven the top-line performance. The company has been witnessing significant design wins for BAW-enabled devices.However, challenging macroeconomic conditions, rising inflation, the adverse effect of the COVID-related lockdown in China and the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on European sales are anticipated to have limited Skyworks' top-line growth.Moreover, shrinking demand for smartphones is expected to have weighed on top-line growth as well as margin expansion in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Per the agreement, the company aims to repurchase $500 million of the common stock.The agreement is part of Northrop’s intent to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2023, signifying business strength and the ability to continue generating profits and return excess cash to shareholders. NOC expects to complete the transaction by the second quarter of 2023.Can NOC Continue to Boost Shareholder Return?Northrop’s commitment to returning 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders is backed by the consistent order inflow, a strong backlog, rising product demand and its ability to deliver products that address an increasingly complex security environment.These factors boost the company’s cash flow generation capacity, thus enabling it to bolster shareholder return. In this context, it is imperative to mention that NOC’s backlog at the end of 2022 increased 4% from 2021, reflecting the company’s capability to steadily perform and generate cash.Additionally, Northrop’s bottom line improved 25% year over year, while its sales increased by 16% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022, signifying increased profitability and higher demand for products. This enables the company to cheer investors with increased dividends and share repurchases.The company increased its dividend by 10% in 2022, which was the 19th consecutive increase. NOC delivered more than $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases.Going forward, Northrop expects sales in the range of $38-$38.4 billion in 2023, suggesting about 4.5% growth from the 2022 reported figure at the midpoint. Adjusted earnings are projected in the range of $21.85-$22.45 per share.The company expects adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.85-$2.15 billion in 2023. This implies an increase of 25% from the 2022 reported figure at the midpoint.Story continuesMoreover, NOC’s capital deployment plan supports its business strategy. In 2022, the company invested more than 7% of revenues in Research &amp; Development and capital expenditures to enhance the capability and capacity of its products, capitalizing on the growing demand through improvised products and augmenting its earnings prospects and the ability to generate excess cash.Backed by such business strength and financial stability, one may expect Northrop to continue to bolster shareholder returns. Moreover, the recent increase in defense spending by the U.S. government and its allies may provide an edge to the company to amplify its returns and shareholder return.Peer MovesDefense companies that have enhanced their share repurchase program or increased dividends for shareholders to show financial strength are as follows:Lockheed Martin LMT delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 through share repurchases of $7.9 billion and paid out dividends of $3 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program and retired approximately seven million shares under the agreement.The long-term earnings growth rate of LMT is pegged at 6.9%. Shares of Lockheed Martin have increased 19.2% in the past year.In December 2022, Raytheon Technologies RTX authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of the outstanding common stock. The new authorization replaces the company's previous program.RTX has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%. Raytheon’s shares have delivered 19.2% in the past year.In October 2022, L3Harris Technologies, Inc. LHX declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share on the common stock and approved an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total current authorization to $4.5 billion.L3Harris’ long-term earnings growth rate is 2.7%.

203,05bed8e3-4199-313a-8111-bc8b9d4f403c,NKE,2023-02-04,13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-value-dividend-stocks-182114715.html,1675448474,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'GSBD', 'NKE', 'BLK', 'JNJ', 'CSX', 'WMT', 'LOW', 'PG']","[In this article, we take a look at 13 best value dividend stocks to buy. If you want to see more best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.Value stocks are stocks of companies generally considered trading below what many investors think they are worth. Because different investors could view a stock differently, what a stock is worth is subjective. Some investors might view a stock as a value stock while others might find the same stock expensive.To find value stocks, we chose stocks that are included in the The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV).According to the ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) 'seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&amp;P® 500 Value Index (the “Index”).The S&amp;P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value segment in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price ratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.'Value stocks can decline as stocks can always trade for lower than what investors think they are worth. As a ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) declined as a whole last year and it could decline this year if economic data doesn't meet estimates.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. When companies have excess capital, many decide to return the excess capital through a stock buyback or by paying a dividend.When profits change, dividends can change. In good times, many companies increase their dividend when their profits increase. In more difficult times, many companies lower their dividends or suspend them altogether.In terms of the economy in 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of being a little stronger than some expected in terms of Q4 GDP. Inflation has also shown signs of potentially peaking last year.Story continuesIn terms of the effect of increased interest rates on inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on February 1, 2023, ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far.""Nevertheless, Powell also said, ""It would be very premature to declare victory, or to think that we’ve really got this.""If economic data doesn't meet estimates, stocks could always decline, including the best value stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy, we selected value stocks from the 407 holdings of the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) as of February 2, 2023.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they paid dividends and that they had considerable earnings growth potential in the next ten years if they maintained their market share.We then sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy13.

Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

204,1591fcfd-8280-3915-9f3e-8beecf4b7d04,NKE,2023-02-04,Is Nike (NKE) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-nke-buy-wall-street-143002672.html,1675434602,STORY,['NKE'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nike (NKE).Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NKE Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $3.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nike may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more hot healthcare stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.The rise of consumer prices has often lagged behind healthcare inflation, which includes costs for doctor visits, surgeries, and prescription drugs. This trend has been especially noticeable during economic downturns, where overall inflation slows while medical prices still rise 2-3%. However, in 2022, the US saw an inflation rate not seen in decades. Even top health stocks like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)  were affected by this. As healthcare delivery systems faced higher costs due to shortages in areas such as nursing and supplies, consumers felt the same financial pressures during the year.The healthcare industry faces tough conditions in 2023 due to persistently high inflation and labor shortages. However, a McKinsey report predicts improvement efforts will help the industry overcome these challenges starting in 2024. Certain segments are expected to see higher growth as shifts in profit pools will be affected by several different factors.The McKinsey report suggests that there will be ongoing growth for healthcare services and technology (HST) profit pools. 2023 is expected to bring robust growth in the sector as providers and payers increase technology adoption. The estimated CAGR for 2021 to 2026 is 10%, reaching $81 billion by 2026. This is an increase from last year’s July estimate, driven by higher demand from payers and providers seeking improved efficiency. This growth makes HST the fastest-growing sector in healthcare. The biggest boost will come from software and platforms. The pharmacy services sector faced worker shortages and inflationary pressure in 2022. However, 2023 is expected to bring growth. The growth rate is projected to remain steady from 2021 through 2026, reaching $65 billion in profit pools by 2026 from $55 billion in 2021. This growth is mostly due to continued drug utilization and higher specialty drug prices but is partially offset by reimbursement pressure, declining profit margins, and increased specialty generic and biosimilar growth.Story continuesAI utilization in healthcare &amp; medicine is surging in 2023. Machine learning can offer data driven CDS to healthcare professionals, leading to increased revenue prospects. AI-powered computers can analyze data at a faster pace, potentially resulting in quicker research advancements. According to Insider Intelligence, AI in healthcare is projected to grow at an annual rate of 48% between 2017 and 2023. The utilization of AI in healthcare holds great promise for enhancing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare expenses. With a growing population, the demand for health services is expected to rise.Prnewswire.com forecasts that the global telemedicine market will reach $197.55 billion at a CAGR of 24.12% in 2023-2028. Telemedicine offers many benefits, including reducing healthcare costs, improving efficiency and profitability, and providing patients with improved access to medical services. In recent years, telemedicine has seen significant growth. It enables patients to connect with doctors from a distance, reducing the financial burden of healthcare. As a result, many healthcare providers are eager to adopt digital health technologies to take advantage of these benefits.Total health expenditure is expected to continue on an upward trend across the globe for the next five years. This growth is closely correlated with industry revenues in the health insurance world. However, McKinsey has cautioned that macro uncertainty will persist in part because the enhanced premium subsidies created by the American Rescue Plan Act have expired, and as a result, pricing and consumer participation may face headwinds in the coming months. Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify healthcare stocks that have gained at least 2% year to date in 2023 and have an average 3-month volume of more than 5 million as of January 31. From this resultant dataset we picked the stocks with highest volumes and share price gains. The list is ranked in ascending order of average 3-month share volume. We also listed the number of hedge funds in each stock so that you can identify the healthcare stocks that are favored by hedge funds.10 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by CDC on UnsplashHot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now10.

A federal appeals court dismissed J&amp;J’s JNJ bankruptcy filing related to its talc lawsuits. The European Commission approved Sanofi SNY and Regeneron’s Dupixent for a new indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEarnings Update: Pfizer’s fourth-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Pfizer issued its financial guidance for 2023.Revenues are expected in the range of $67.0 to $71.0 billion, indicating an operational decline of 29%-33% from the 2022 level. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, reflecting an operational decline of 48%-51% from the 2022 level. However, Pfizer’s 2023 outlook fell well below market expectations due to steep declines expected in revenues from its COVID-19 products as a result of lower demand. Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer expects its revenues to rise 7% to 9% on an operational basis in 2023.Merck’s fourth-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Sales of its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Lagevrio were better than expected backed by higher demand in outside U.S. market. Though sales of key products cancer drug, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine rose in the quarter, they were less than our expectations. Keytruda sales of $5.45 billion rose 19% year over year while sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 6% year over year in the year.Merck issued a fresh earnings and sales outlook for 2023. Merck expects revenues to be in the range of $57.2 - $58.7 billion in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $6.80 and $6.95.Lilly reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating earnings estimates but missing on sales. Sales rose 9% year over year due to higher sales of key drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance and others and contribution from the recently approved diabetes drug, Mounjaro. Lilly revised the financial guidance for 2023, which it provided in December 2022, reiterating the revenue guidance range of $30.3 billion and $30.8 billion while increasing its earnings expectations from $8.10-$8.30 to $8.35-$8.55 per share.Story continuesNovartis’ fourth-quarter results were also mixed. It beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues. Sales in the Innovative Medicines unit rose 3% at constant currency, driven by the strong growth of products like Entresto, Kesimpta, Pluvicto and Kisqali. Sales in the Sandoz division were flat as higher volumes were offset by lower price. The company issued its financial guidance for 2023. It expects sales to grow in the low-to-mid single-digit range and core operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit range in 2023.Novo Nordisk also beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues. The Diabetes and Obesity Care segment’s sales rose 20% at CER, while sales in the Rare disease segment were down 2% at CER. In 2023, the company expects sales and operating profit to grow in the range of 13-19% at CER.Appeals Court Rejects J&amp;J’s Bankruptcy Claim in Talc Lawsuits: An appeals court rejected J&amp;J’s bankruptcy filing via its subsidiary LTL Management LLC related to its talc lawsuits. J&amp;J faces numerous lawsuits, which allege that its baby powder and other talc products contain asbestos that causes cancer. LTL Management, which was established to manage claims in the cosmetic talc litigation, filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection in North Carolina to resolve J&amp;J’s talc-related claims in 2021. The J&amp;J subsidiary is now prevented from transferring over 38,000 claims for its talc-based products out of trial courts and into a bankruptcy court. The appeals court believes that LTL Management was solely created to file for Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) protection. The court stated that only a debtor in financial distress can seek protection under bankruptcy laws.Per the precedent passed by the appeals court, LTL Management is backed by J&amp;J, an entity with a triple-A-rated payment obligation and holds billions in cash reserves, and therefore has ample financial resources to fulfil such claims.FDA Approves Lilly’s New Lymphoma Drug, Jaypirca: The FDA granted accelerated approval to Lilly’s BTK inhibitor, pirtobrutinib (100 mg &amp; 50 mg tablets) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma in adult patients previously treated with at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Jaypirca. The approval was based on data from the phase I/II BRUIN study, which showed that treatment with Jaypirca led to an overall response rate of 50% in the abovementioned patient group, with 13% of patients achieving a complete response. Jaypirca is the second of five new medicines that Lilly expects to launch by 2023 end. The other product already launched is Mounjaro for type II diabetes.Sanofi/Regeneron’s Dupixent Gets EU Approval for Eosinophilic Esophagitis: The European Commission approved Sanofi and Regeneron blockbuster medicines, Dupixent (dupilumab) for treating adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory disease. With the approval, Dupixent has become the first and only targeted medicine indicated for people aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis in the country. Dupixent was approved by the FDA for eosinophilic esophagitis in patients aged 12 years and above in May 2022. Dupixent is now approved to treat five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis, in both Europe and the United States.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.5% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, Pfizer rose the most (0.2%), while Lilly declined the most (5%).In the past six months, Merck has risen the most (19.2%), while Pfizer declined the most (11.1%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: JNJ Q4 Results Mixed, MRK Keytruda Prostate Cancer Study Ends)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for the Q4 results of AstraZeneca and AbbVie and regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-trending-140002210.html,1675432802,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +14%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 34.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.09 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.1%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.77 indicates a change of +16.7% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $7.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.9%. The $27.53 billion and $29.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.5% and +7.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

214,80052c6a-6e1f-3d02-acca-326362c31544,IBM,2023-02-04,Don't Race Out To Buy International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) Just Because It's Going Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-race-buy-international-business-123957618.html,1675514397,STORY,['IBM'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase International Business Machines' shares before the 9th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.65 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.60 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, International Business Machines stock has a trailing yield of around 4.8% on the current share price of $136.94. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether International Business Machines's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. International Business Machines paid out a disturbingly high 334% of its profit as dividends last year, which makes us concerned there's something we don't fully understand in the business. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (69%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.Story continuesIt's good to see that while International Business Machines's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Extraordinarily few companies are capable of persistently paying a dividend that is greater than their profits.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're discomforted by International Business Machines's 20% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, International Business Machines has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.9% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. International Business Machines is already paying out 334% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.Final TakeawayHas International Business Machines got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been shrinking in recent times. Additionally, International Business Machines is paying out quite a high percentage of its earnings, and more than half its cash flow, so it's hard to evaluate whether the company is reinvesting enough in its business to improve its situation. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with International Business Machines. We've identified 4 warning signs with International Business Machines (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us), and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

215,a8cb6066-c08e-35c6-92e3-90547d60b19a,IBM,2023-02-04,CFOs reveal what key moves helped propel their careers forward,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cfos-reveal-key-moves-helped-114939646.html,1675424979,STORY,['IBM'],"[Good morning,Today is Part 5, and the finale, of our week-long series on what it takes to become a CFO. We shared the skill sets and tech tools that modern CFOs will need, along with a peek into the career journeys of current finance chiefs.Last week, in CFO Daily, I asked finance chiefs to respond to the questions: What is the most important thing you did before landing your first CFO position? What made you ready to take on the role? And many of you took the time to answer!CFOs in health and financial services industriesAfter almost 14 years in investment banking at JP Morgan, and moving from associate to vice president to managing director, I knew that I wanted to do something different. I was also the proud mother of twin 5-year-old boys at the time. I mustered the courage to take a yearlong sabbatical. I really had time to reflect on what I wanted next in my career. At the end of my sabbatical, with a little luck and good connections, I became CFO for JP Morgan’s commercial banking business. —Karen Parkhill, EVP and CFO at MedtronicThe key to getting your first CFO job I would say is patience. There are a lot of jobs out there with the CFO title (and lots of headhunters calling about them) but they are not all equal. I found it important to wait for an opportunity that balanced the right industry, position profile that matched with my experiences, size, and ultimately, location. —David Phillipps, EVP and CFO, EquinoxI took my first CFO job after having been a banker. So I learned everything from the ground up. Whether you’re the CFO of a business unit, a region, or a company, you need to make sure your relationship with the CEO is one built on trust, common views, and vision. —W. Dave Dowrich, senior executive vice president and CFO at TIAAI am retired now from over 40 years in medical devices. The important things to me over the years were: understanding the products and the operations side of the business; developing trust at all levels of the organization; really becoming a trusted partner of the CEO; setting a high bar for performance and integrity; and understanding the numbers. —Ron Stevenson, CFO, retiredStory continuesCFOs in the tech industryI was very intentional in my career in building a development path to become the CFO of a public or pre-IPO company. I made sure that I gained experience leading corporate FP&amp;A and investor relations. Managing investors and external key stakeholders in all its aspects is also key for a public company CFO. —Tiziana Figliolia, CFO, HootsuiteOne of the most important things I did before becoming the CFO of Workday was a heat experience with my organization’s product and technology team. A heat experience is a high-stakes, high-stress assignment that pushes you outside your comfort zone and demands you grow as a leader. After nearly five years as a leader in corporate finance for Workday, I became the general manager of our financial management applications organization—a 600-member technology organization 10 times the size of my previous finance team. Up until that moment, all my experience was in more traditional corporate finance and FP&amp;A roles, but I leveraged this unique opportunity to gain valuable experience. —Barbara Larson, CFO, WorkdayOne of the most beneficial pivots I made in my career was stepping out of a core finance role for three and a half years in 2015 to lead the next evolution of IBM as SVP, transformation and operations. I had the opportunity to work on IBM’s transformation—redesigning IBM’s operating model to align with fundamental market shifts and driving new, agile ways of working. But at the core of this role, I learned more about the importance of culture, our people, talent, skills and processes. Tackling the responsibilities of the transformation role and driving value through the organization helped me look at everything with a new perspective, one that has carried through to my current role as CFO. —Jim Kavanaugh, SVP and CFO, IBMTaking high-risk assignments. At one point in my career, I recall my boss asking me to step out of a role I loved to build a shared services operation. I did not have a strong background in accounting and was not thrilled with the assignment. However, in hindsight, I greatly appreciate that rotation. —Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, EVP of finance and CFO, Analog DevicesThere’s a stereotype that finance teams spend all their time in spreadsheets, but building relationships was my most important step in getting to the CFO’s office. —Jennifer Grunebaum, CFO, DevoIf I had to pick one word that was the most important thing I did to prepare me for today, that would be ""change."" I actually looked for changes at each step that allowed me to have more influence on the businesses that I was a part of. When the opportunity to join Red Hat as SVP and CFO came up, I was excited because it was a ‘two-for’—a new network to apply my skills and also a different stage company to drive growth and value. —Robert Leibrock, CFO, Red Hat It is a given that you should have a high degree of business acumen, but the importance of networking, building relationships and working collaboratively with business leaders in your industry cannot be overstated as essential steps towards becoming a successful CFO. —Kirsty Godfrey-Billy, CFO, XeroOne of the most significant changes I witnessed over this time is the increasing prominence of data analytics as finance technology has grown in sophistication. Seeing this shift, I prioritized integrating data into my decision-making as my career progressed. —Jeremy Klaperman, CFO of RhoI do think my investment banking role was helpful in learning critical thinking, and having exposure to multiple leadership styles, due diligence processes and industries. Also, having a diverse set of experiences across strategy roles, finance roles and leadership roles. — Katie Rooney, CFO, Alight SolutionsBefore landing my first position, I worked in financial planning and analysis, accounting, sales, and investor operations—for both public and private companies, including Google, Apple, Adobe, and Looker. I developed cross-functional business knowledge and valuable leadership skills. —Razzak Jallow, CFO, FloQastGoing into investor relations at Microsoft was one of the best career decisions I made prior to stepping into the CFO role elsewhere. It gave me insight into investor expectations and how to better communicate business performance beyond a spreadsheet. —Bill Koefoed, CFO, OneStream SoftwareI started my career as an auditor at KPMG and worked over 10 years on several large public companies. I was fortunate to jump to VP finance of a publicly-traded radio broadcast company and led over two dozen M&amp;A transactions. This fast-paced environment provided the experience and confidence for me to take the next step as CFO. —Omar Choucair, CFO, TrintechThere are three key things that prepared me most to become CFO: developing a deep understanding of how a SaaS business works; developing executive presence; and constructing a financial narrative about the business that we could strive to execute on consistently over time. —Tony Tiscornia, CFO, Coupa SoftwareBefore I became a CFO, I purposefully spent four years of my career outside of finance as the general manager of three different business units for my last company. In that role, I was tasked with managing teams in sales, marketing, and even product and engineering. Investing the time to really understand the functional areas outside of finance was the single most important thing I did before landing my first CFO position. —Chirag Shah, CFO, Kong Inc.Before becoming a CFO, I was fortunate enough to travel around the world with my CRO. This allowed me to understand how sales, product and engineering all came together, and some of the challenges they faced. —Brian Robins, CFO, GitLab Developing a strong background in various operations roles is key and ultimately placed me in a position to succeed as a CFO. —Chris Jodoin, CFO and COO, EverestLabsTwo things helped me prepare for my role as CFO: mentorship and stepping outside of my comfort zone. —Kevin Rubin, CFO, AlteryxTaking new and challenging roles to diversify my skill set has been instrumental for me throughout my current position as CFO. —Libby Merrill, CFO, ThreatX My willingness to speak up and raise my hand for a project or role prepared me to be a CFO, even when I was afraid I didn't have all the needed experience. —Angela Pierce, president, CFO, Anaconda, Inc.You can view all of this week's stories here.

Brooke DiPalma is here with the buzz ahead of the big game. It is exciting to see how early they roll out the ads to generate the excitement.BROOKE DI PALMA: Earlier and earlier. And for me, as we discussed before this segment, I'm not really here for the game. I'm here for the commercials, for the food--DAVE BRIGGS: Fair. That's fair.BROOKE DI PALMA: --for the entertainment.DAVE BRIGGS: Most are.BROOKE DI PALMA: But it's amazing to see just how much these food and beverage companies are bringing to the table and just how much they're spending to bring these commercials to the table. So I spoke to one marketing professor who said for a 30-second ad, you're looking at $7 million. Add $2 million for production. Add $2 million to promote that on social media. Add $2 million for promotions. And if you're going to add another 30 seconds, make that $14 million on top of the 6, and call that $20 million for a one-minute ad on Super Bowl Sunday.Now before the game even starts, these marketing professors say that you should actually already see your return in investment. So that's pretty amazing to see how much you're investing. And just know that before it actually even airs, you should see how much you paid, $20 million already back. Now if we take a look at some of the big names here, partnerships is going to be a big deal this Super Bowl Sunday. We saw General Motors team up with Netflix, but ironically, we also saw Michelob Ultra team up with Netflix, promote their ""Full Swing,"" the documentary.- What are y'all watching?- ""Full Swing."" It's a new golf show on Netflix.Story continues- Come on, Justin.BROOKE DI PALMA: So partnerships are really key here. When you think about other partnerships that we're going to see, it's the Molson Coors ad that teams up with DraftKings, both intended to meet a more consumer-friendly, buzzy audience, looking to draw attention here then maybe they want to get from their primary audience.And another company that we're hearing a lot of buzz ahead of the Super Bowl is M&amp;M's, ahead of their official rebranding to M&amp;Yeahs with Maya Rudolph. Now, apparently, that's drumming a lot of buzz, but apparently, it might be a publicity stunt here. And we did not hear back from M&amp;M, so there's lots of speculation about that. According to a TV measurement analytics company, this is already performing 88% more. That's that people are engaging 88% more than this time last year with M&amp;M's ad. So whether it's a publicity stunt or not--DAVE BRIGGS: It is.BROOKE DI PALMA: --it's working.SEANA SMITH: It is. It is a publicity stunt. But it's clearly working. So Brooke, you just laid out how much it costs for all of these brands to advertise--BROOKE DI PALMA: Insane.SEANA SMITH: --during the Super Bowl. Clearly, not everyone's doing it. Some people are trying to drum up some of their own excitement.BROOKE DI PALMA: That's right.SEANA SMITH: You've got them out right here.BROOKE DI PALMA: Yeah, well, people are just saying, forget the Super Bowl Sunday, and let's just go straight to the product. So here in front of us, we have Kraft Heinz Ketchup. Their logo is 57. I'll put this right back there so you guys can see it. It's 57. And they're saying, forget the Roman numerals. They're putting out a sweepstakes asking consumers, should we just forget them? In addition to that, Hormel Chili coming out with this chili cheese beer. They teamed up with a local brewery to do this. Let's all pass it around. Let's have a taste. But essentially, they're just saying that packaged food companies aren't performing as well on Super Bowl Sunday as maybe they used to be when there wasn't social media. And so now these companies like Hormel and like Kraft Heinz are opting for new ways.DAVE BRIGGS: So just--SEANA SMITH: Oh, this tastes interesting.DAVE BRIGGS: Just, again, in case you missed it, this is chili cheese beer from Hormel.SEANA SMITH: I thought it was going to be a lot better. I thought it was going to be good.BROOKE DI PALMA: It does taste like-- it actually does smell like chili. It really does.SEANA SMITH: It tastes a little too much like chili.BROOKE DI PALMA: It really does. It tastes like--SEANA SMITH: Let's have your review.BROOKE DI PALMA: Is there such thing as a chili broth? Because that's what it tastes like.JARED BLIKRE: Whew.BROOKE DI PALMA: Jared--DAVE BRIGGS: I don't mind that.JARED BLIKRE: You know, I'm actually--SEANA SMITH: It's a weird aftertaste.JARED BLIKRE: --pretty glad that I don't drink anymore because it sounds a little bit scary. So I'm just going to let you get--- OK, we have that product placement expert that--BROOKE DI PALMA: Oh, my God.DAVE BRIGGS: It's an acquired taste.SEANA SMITH: It is.BROOKE DI PALMA: But these are already sold out online, Hormel Foods confirmed. And so when you think about just how much excitement this drummed up, maybe it'll get people to go down the condiment aisle as opposed to not.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: It's growing on me in like 30 seconds.SEANA SMITH: Oh, it's growing on you. Yeah, I don't know if it's just the time that it's Friday, and I'm kind of in the mood for a drink, or if I-- or if this is--JARED BLIKRE: Let me smell this.SEANA SMITH: --growing on me.BROOKE DI PALMA: It smells a little like chili.SEANA SMITH: It smells a little-- yeah, it tastes a little bit too much like the real thing.BROOKE DI PALMA: Certainly a new way to drum up excitement ahead of the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: It is, and it's working. We're talking about it right here on the show.DAVE BRIGGS: Miller and Coors executives join us Monday to talk about--BROOKE DI PALMA: Ooh.DAVE BRIGGS: --their first Super Bowl ad in 30 years.BROOKE DI PALMA: With Draft Kings.JARED BLIKRE: Somebody has to take the empty, right?SEANA SMITH: There we go.

The new hybrid engine “formula,” or rules, allow new electric motors and battery technology along with the use of e-fuels.For Ford, a brand which is still the 3rd-winningest engine maker in F1 despite leaving the sport in 2004 (when its sold the Jaguar F1 team to Red Bull coincidentally), a return to top flight motorsports with a focus on hybrid tech makes a lot of sense.Red Bull Racing unveils the team's new Formula One car during a launch event in New York City on February 3, 2023. (Photo by Ed JONES / AFP) (Photo by ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images)“This is a technology transfer that's very specific. We will help them with their software for the battery control and the battery chemistry. We're investing a lot in EVs and we're gonna have 2 million EVs on the road in ‘26 - so we know a lot about EV batteries,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in an interview with Yahoo Finance on the Red Bull partnership.“On the other hand, we can learn a lot from them about telemetry, but especially about aero; aero is becoming the most important thing in vehicle design now and ... the best aerodynamics of the world are at Red Bull. So it's a great exchange technology.”Formula 1 is a huge, global phenomenon with weekly audiences ranging in the hundred of millions across the globe. But it's not just the marketing and exposure Ford desires. It’s also the technology transfer and insights gained at the highest end of motorsports that trickles down to road cars.Farley said improving aerodynamics on EVs is critically important, where a more slippery design could add 75 miles of range to a vehicle like the F-150 Lightning. And Red Bull chief aerodynamicist Adrian Newey is known as the best in the business when it comes to car design.Story continuesAnd with F1’s new rules targeting higher hybrid performance in the future, it made sense for Ford to take the leap.The transformation to EVs for Ford, which has been quicker than some of its rivals like GM and Toyota, hasn’t come without its hiccups. A weak Q4 earnings report highlights some of the difficulties Ford is facing at the moment, mainly with costs and parts supply, but Farley says give the automaker some time to set things right.“Be patient with Ford; we are under double transformation,” Farley said. “Some things are going really fast, we're now number two in EVs, the Lightning is sold out for like another year.”

    On the other hand, while Farley is surprised at the speed of the transformation, there have been issues in the purchasing supply chain, and higher costs associated with manufacturing and engineering. Farley says they need to bring their costs down, and do better to execute. “We just have to get a lot of costs out,” he says.Which brings us back to F1. Ford didn’t want to buy a team like other manufacturers have done (and GM might do in the future). A partnership with an existing, winning team like Red Bull made sense both strategically and financially, for a company like Ford that wants to maximize every dollar.“We didn't want to spend, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars a year going back to Formula One,” Farley, who is an experienced racer himself, said regarding Ford’s motorsports gameplan. “Formula One, Nascar, these are really important circuit [formats] for us, but Formula One is something new, and we really want to tie it to our EV technology.”—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Ford's ticker page was the most viewed on the Yahoo Finance platform through midday.Execs at the company pinned the blame on still-high costs of production for gas-powered autos and expenses associated with the shift to EV development, among other factors.Here is how Ford performed in the fourth quarter versus Wall Street estimates:Ford Earnings OverviewRevenue: $44.0 billion vs. $39.9 billion expectedAdjusted EPS: $0.51 vs. $0.62 expectedAdj. EBIT: $2.6 billion vs. $3.45 billion expectedWins: 1) Sense of urgency by management on the need to cut costs; 2) Strong balance sheet.Misses: 1) Ugly earnings miss, suggesting still overly optimistic Street estimates; 2) No. 1 in U.S. recalls over the past two years.One positive from the quarter — if anything — was that Ford CEO Jim Farley was fired up on the earnings call.Ford CEO Jim Farley speaks during the official launch of the all-new Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S. April 26, 2022. REUTERS/Rebecca CookFarley is credited with reviving the company's image among Wall Streeters and the public, mostly through the debut of hot-selling EVs such as the Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. But the CEO acknowledged on the call that the 2022 profit performance was unacceptable and he and his team are ""on it,"" so to speak.""Our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance last year fell short of our potential,"" Farley told analysts. ""And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts. And to say I'm frustrated is an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford.""Story continuesFarley's tone on costs was in stark contrast to that of rival GM (GM) earlier in the week. GM was generally seen as managing expenses well in the fourth quarter, with CFO Paul Jacobson telling Yahoo Finance Live (video above) the company is targeting $2 billion in cost cuts this year.The cab to a Ford all-electric F-150 Lightning truck prototype is seen on an automated guided vehicle (AGV) in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S. September 16, 2021.

(NYSE:BXP) have taken quite a beating over the past year. The stock has tumbled nearly 35%, presenting investors with a potential value opportunity.Boston Properties Will Remain Under PressureMoreover, the real estate investment trust offers a significant dividend yield of 5.3%, along with relatively strong financial metrics. However, the dwindling economic environment and secular headwinds from the work-from-home trend will likely weigh down the stock and its business in the interim.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with BXP. Click here to check it out. BXP 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BXPPeter Lynch Chart of BXPBoston Properties has arguably been one of the best office REITs over the years, building a reputation for growing its business and rewarding shareholders. Its management's savvy business decisions enabled it to become the largest listed developer and owner of Class A office properties in the U.S. The company has also increased its exposure to tenants in industries such as life sciences and technology to strengthen its portfolio further.Regardless, the REIT is currently trading at a substantial bargain. The stock trades at 3.81 times trailing 12-month sales, which is lower than the industry median of 7.40.Work-from-home trend presents a major riskThe crippling effects of the pandemic cast a shadow on the future of office spaces. Businesses around the world increasingly moved toward remote and hybrid workplace models. This shift had a huge impact on vacancy rates in nearly every market. Moreover, the trend did not subside last year and vacancy rates are still climbing, a situation that may be felt for years to come.Moreover, with federal tax breaks, low interest rates and inflated demand from unprofitable startups, the U.S. became one of the leaders in empty office spaces worldwide. Compounding the problem has been a migration from blue to red states following the pandemic. The higher taxes and living costs in blue states have led to a substantial loss in residents. As a result, REITs such as Boston Properties, which generate the bulk of their earnings from these states, are under immense pressure.Story continuesFor instance, San Francisco, one of the major business areas for Boston Properties, saw record levels of office vacancies last year. Vacancies in the city climbed to their highest levels since 1993, according to real estate firm CBRE. Moreover, the city's office vacancy rate reached an eye-watering 25.5% after September, up from 20% during the same period last year. At the beginning of the pandemic, vacancy rates were at just 4%.Pessimism reignsBoston Properties has shown remarkable resilience in the past, so its current low share price suggests something may be off. Beyond the work-from-home trend, there are likely several other headwinds facing the company.The pessimism is reflected in management's guidance from its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results, which were released earlier this week. The REIT reduced its funds from operations projections for 2023 to a range of $7.08 to $7.18 per share from the previous consensus guidance of $7.15 to $7.30 per share. Moreover, its outlook also falls short of analysts' estimates of $7.21.The company's conservative guidance suggests occupancy levels may further deteriorate from where they ended the year, indicating it expects a slow comeback over the next several quarters. This forward guidance is undoubtedly disappointing and calls into question the long-term picture for this REIT.On a more positive note, Boston Properties still has a rock-solid balance sheet, which should give it enough wiggle room to work through its issues. Its maturity schedule is under control, and it is unlikely to see a major impact from higher interest rates. The bulk of its debt is at a fixed rate, and the amount maturing is not that significant over the next few years. Moreover, during its fourth quarter, it could effectively execute 5.7 million square feet of leases.Exposure to the tech industry is a negativeLooking beyond earnings, the next few quarters will likely be tricky for Boston Properties.Whatever happens with the broader markets, CEO Owen Thomas believes the real estate sector is already in a recession. He said many clients are implementing cost-saving measures due to lackluster top-line revenue. This has prevented new expansions and resulted in the outright forfeiture of space.The biggest issue for Boston Properties is that most of its customers are members of the tech space. These companies are aggressively cutting costs and laying off staff. Expansion is the last thing on their minds.In addition, strong demand for premier workplaces has contributed significantly to the REIT's activity over the last several years. This is because they are a fixture of their portfolio and are responsible for 95% of the average volume over the past 10 years. However, roughly 20% of its portfolio is represented by premier workplaces and buildings. It can create a supply chain crisis, as there continues to be strong demand for office space, but the square footage is just not there.Overall, the office and commercial real estate markets remain in trouble. Office transactions for the fourth quarter were down 40% from third-quarter levels, and management does not expect to be at positive absorption in 2023.TakeawayBoston Properties presents a mixed bag for those that want to invest in the REIT space. On one hand, it has posted strong metrics for 2022. Demand for quality workspace is still strong, but hotels and other establishments will be hard-pressed to keep up with that demand. The market will likely be undersupplied over the long term.As such, the situation will remain in a state of stress for the office REIT. There is a lot of volatility in the market amid the likelihood of interest rate increases to combat inflation. Boston Properties is still recovering from the pandemic, and the same is true for its tenants. Considering these circumstances, the stock could be a good option now, but may fall further.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to see more best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.Value stocks are stocks of companies generally considered trading below what many investors think they are worth. Because different investors could view a stock differently, what a stock is worth is subjective. Some investors might view a stock as a value stock while others might find the same stock expensive.To find value stocks, we chose stocks that are included in the The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV).According to the ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) 'seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&amp;P® 500 Value Index (the “Index”).The S&amp;P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value segment in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price ratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.'Value stocks can decline as stocks can always trade for lower than what investors think they are worth. As a ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) declined as a whole last year and it could decline this year if economic data doesn't meet estimates.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. When companies have excess capital, many decide to return the excess capital through a stock buyback or by paying a dividend.When profits change, dividends can change. In good times, many companies increase their dividend when their profits increase. In more difficult times, many companies lower their dividends or suspend them altogether.In terms of the economy in 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of being a little stronger than some expected in terms of Q4 GDP. Inflation has also shown signs of potentially peaking last year.Story continuesIn terms of the effect of increased interest rates on inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on February 1, 2023, ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far.""Nevertheless, Powell also said, ""It would be very premature to declare victory, or to think that we’ve really got this.""If economic data doesn't meet estimates, stocks could always decline, including the best value stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy, we selected value stocks from the 407 holdings of the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) as of February 2, 2023.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they paid dividends and that they had considerable earnings growth potential in the next ten years if they maintained their market share.We then sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy13.

(NYSE:LOW) is a leading home improvement retailer that has a strong brand and sizable economies of scale. If interest rates don't rise too much further, there's a chance that the housing market could rebound a little faster than expected. If that happens, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) could benefit.

(NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

There were about 50 million people that would have otherwise taken a cruise in 2020 and 2021 and ultimately didn't get to. Now, some of those people have gotten back on in the year or so since, but a significant portion has not.I think the other thing that helps-- and we're entering what's called wave season, right, when a disproportionate number of bookings are made for the upcoming, you know, spring break and summer season. That was really marred last year by, you know, the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and then also the outbreak of omicron.

There were about 50 million people that would have otherwise taken a cruise in 2020 and 2021 and ultimately didn't get to.Now some of those people have gotten back on in the year or so since. But a significant portion has not. I think the other thing that helps-- and we're entering what's called wave season, right, when a disproportionate number of bookings are made for the upcoming spring break and summer season, that was really marred last year by the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and then also the outbreak of Omicron. This year's wave season, by all accounts from the work that we do, is off to a much better start. And by all accounts, it's off to a strong start. And so I think that sets the table to have a much more productive year.JARED BLIKRE: Let me ask you about going forward. Now we had over the pandemic, we had a number of habits and behaviors that change. I'm just wondering, for the average person who doesn't, let's say, go on a cruise very often, have they been able to penetrate, or are they relying on repeat customers? I'm just wondering what their TAM currently is versus the general population that may have some lingering misgivings about going on a cruise.Story continuesJAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, it's a fair point. I think it's a critical question. I do think it's safe to say that in the early reopening stages, it was overwhelmingly repeat customers, right? In addition to all of the angst surrounding the pandemic, not a whole lot of people that have never set foot on a cruise ship were willing to sort of add that extra anxiety. I think as we've gotten into late '22 and early '23, we are hearing about new cruisers getting back into the space, which I think is a critical component.You could argue, sort of based on my previous commentary, 50 million people that are sort of regular cruisers, that you don't necessarily need that new customer in the early going. But for this industry to get back to where it would like to get to, you need that new customer. I also think it's worth noting that only about 15 million Americans have ever been on a cruise, right? And so if you think about the TAM being certainly most Americans, they're just scratching the surface. And so it doesn't take a ton of new cruisers to grow that 15 million number pretty dramatically.SEANA SMITH: Well, James, just looking at the price of some of these stocks here since the start of the year, Royal Caribbean, I know you've got a buy rating on that. That stock up 38%, just since January 1. How much of this good news is already priced in? And if it's not, what's the upside potential for that?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I mean, it really depends on how you frame it, right? Since the beginning of the year, these stocks have been on a tear. If you compare it to 2019, right, for an overall market that's up 25%, 30%, Royal Caribbean is just half of what it was trading coming out of 2019. Now that is maybe not an apples to apples comparison because they have layered on a lot of that. But it just goes to show that this is an industry that's been left behind by the rest of the market. And so they have a long way to go playing catch-up here.DAVE BRIGGS: My assumption-- and it could be an incorrect one, James-- they often are-- is the typical cruise customer is just shopping around trying to get the best deal. But you have Royal Caribbean as a buy. So what is their competitive advantage against their competitors?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I mean, price is very important. So you're right from that perspective. But in a lot of instances, not as important as some other factors, most notably the itinerary, right? And Royal Caribbean is arguably the most glocal cruise brand. And I think that helps if you're trying to go to a remote destination, some of the most attractive destinations.I think they're a best bet, and I think they're a good combination of breadth of their offering and also perception of their brand. I would probably put them number one, those two factors combined. But yeah, I think there are a lot of factors. The newness of the ships, right? The features on the ships, and certainly, the destinations play a big role. And RCL is certainly no slouch in that perspective.JARED BLIKRE: James, we got to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights here. James Hardiman.]"

He expects the new sanctions will play out in a similar way that the EU's crude oil ban has, meaning Russian volumes will not see a meaningful dip as exports are rerouted from Europe to other countries.""Everything we have seen over the last year tells us not to underestimate that Russia hasn't got this figured out,"" Smith said.Meanwhile, a price cap on Russian fuels will also be imposed. Similar to the crude oil price cap, the EU and G7 plan to bar other countries from accessing insurance and shipping services unless they abide by a cap on refined products.But Smith expects the new price cap to be a moot point, as it will likely be too high to be relevant. There are also too many different products with different prices to justify any single price cap, which will make it harder to implement than previous ceilings.Story continuesIn addition to diesel, Russia produces a range of other refined products, including jet fuel and fuel oil, requiring separate price caps for each.Regardless of the price cap, buyers of Russian fuels will likely see discounts when the ban takes effect, Smith predicted.Discounted oil prices have allowed Russia to maintain strong seaborne crude exports even after the December embargo. While Moscow's energy revenue has fallen, the key point is that neither Russian production nor exports have crashed, Smith noted.""You have countries, such as India, that's able to purchase Russian crude at a significant discount, and so they do it,"" he said. ""We've seen a number of EU countries taking crude and diesel from Russia over the last year because of the economics, rather than self-sanctioning. Pricing has driven the energy situation with Russia.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Nick?Story continuesNicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Wow, it's been some year and quite a quarter. China knee jerking from Zero COVID and strict lockdowns to living with COVID in unprecedented virus explosion, diminished but still continuing spikes in the supply chain, the ongoing Ukraine war, the emergence of -- the reemergence of Brexit and now the rising shadow of the recession, echoing in almost daily public pronouncements. And thru it all, Snap-on delivered another in a long line of encouraging performances. We'll go through it. Starting with the highlights of the quarter and the year, I'll give you my perspective on the results, the market environment and our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into -- as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.The fourth quarter was encouraging. We believe it emphatically demonstrates the continuing resilience of our markets and the capability of our operations to achieve in the face of difficulty, wielding the power of our product our brand, our people and our strategic position. It all combines to serve as clear evidence of what we already know. Snap-on is a unique and extraordinary operation. The results for the fourth quarter serve as more testimony to that fact, and they are an unmistakable demonstration of our continuing momentum. Of course, we did with the differences from group to group and within the operations, but we believe the overall results are compelling. Fourth quarter sales of $1.159 billion as reported, up 4.3% from 2021 included a substantial impact from unfavorable foreign currency of $37.7 million a 370 basis point headwind, and an organic sales increase of 8% over last year, and that represented a 22.7% rise over 2019.This now represents the corporation's tenth consecutive quarter above prepandemic levels. It's a trend of, I think, some significance in uncertain times like these. From an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter, including the impact from unfavorable foreign currency was $248 million, up 6.8% compared to 2021 and 44.7% above the 2019 pre-pandemic level. The OI margin for the quarter, it was 21.5%, improving by 50 basis points over last year and 360 basis points over 2019. It's the same resiliency that's been demonstrated over the years as we paid dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single interruption or reduction. In fact, in November, our dividend was raised by 14.1%, marking the 13th straight year of increases.It's more a testimony of Snap-on's consistent performance through varying environments. This is just another one of them. For Financial Services, operating income of $63.9 million was down from 67 point -- $63.9 million was down from the $67.2 million in 2021. That decrease reflected the forecasted -- our forecast to return to more historical provision levels, but all the while keeping delinquencies flat to last year. And our overall quarterly EPS reached $4.42, $0.32 or 7.8% above 2021 and up 43.5% compared with 2019. Well, those are the numbers. Now to the markets. We believe that automotive repair remains very favorable. It makes sense. The average age of vehicles continue to increase. The complexity of repairs is rising steeply as new platforms enter the vehicle park, and enter they have, starting in dealerships.And we have seen a resurgence in dealership projects despite a still recovering supply chain. Changes in internal combustion, the rise of electric vehicles and the expansion of vehicle autonomy have made dealerships eager for new equipment to support complex repair test of the evolving vehicle park, and we see it. Projects and powertrains aside, dealerships continue to see healthy demand in repair and maintenance and in warranty, driving the need for shop expansion and more technicians. You can see it in the macros. Repair spending, technician numbers, technician wages, all up. Our dealership segment is expanding. And for independent repair shops, confidence remains sky high across the board. Shop owners and managers confirm that demand for repairs for technicians over complex skills are all rising, and our sales growth in that sector mirrors that enthusiasm.We believe we're moving into what we can be called the golden age of vehicle repair, and our Tools Group and RS&amp;I group are uniquely positioned with the product, the brand and the people to take full advantage, even in the midst of turbulence. You can see it. Now for the critical industries, where our Commercial &amp; Industrial Group, or C&amp;I operates. We continue to see progress but the group spans wide jurisdictions. And as such, various headwinds across the geographies and the industries have attenuated some of those gains. For geographies, Europe with the war and the reemergence of Brexit and China impacted by the COVID chaos were a stark contrast to relatively strong North American markets, a lot of variation. And the range in variability among sectors also continue to be a challenge.Natural resources, heavy-duty fleets, general industries and international aviations were robust, but the military area remain challenged. Overall, however, order demand for most of the critical industries has been strong, and we believe that's a great signal for C&amp;I's future. So C&amp;I does have challenges across geographies and the segments, but we have made advancements, and we see opportunities for tomorrow. Going forward, we believe we'll keep moving down our runways for growth, our wide runways for growth. And as we proceed, we're also fortified, as all of you have heard before, by our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They're the core processes that drive our ongoing progress, especially customer connection and innovation, growing our product line.You see, our franchisees and our direct sales force puts us in a strategic advantage, standing face-to-face with professional techs, understanding their individual challenges, showcasing the solutions created by our powerful product and demonstrating their use. Our resilient markets do represent a significant opportunity, and we are there to take advantage up close and personal, like no one else, right where the jobs are done. And it's working. 2022 was a year of substantial headwinds, but our team prevailed with the year achieving new heights. Sales up $4 billion, $492.8 million, up 5.7%, reflecting an organic gain of 8.7% compared to 2021 and a 20.2% organic increase versus 2019. The opco margin for the year was 20.9%, up 90 basis points from '21 and exceeding the prepandemic margins by 170 basis points.As reported, earnings per share for the year were $16.82, up 12.7% from '21 and represented a rise of 35.5% from 2019. It's all evidence of the decisive and ongoing momentum that marked the year and the quarter. Now the operating groups. Let's start with C&amp;I. Fourth quarter sales of million for the group were down $15.5 million versus last year, including $21.2 million in unfavorable currency and a 1.7% organic gain. Our Specialty Tools division was a clear positive with double-digit gains. Precision is becoming essential every day, and our toric products are putting us right in the middle of that rise. Our critical industries also showed strength, especially in North America, propelled by growth in natural resources, general and heavy duty, partially attenuated by lower military activity.Outside North America, it was a different story. SNA Europe was down and China was diminished. OI for C&amp;I was $47.9 million, down $2.2 million primarily from the $2.3 million in unfavorable foreign currency. The group's operating margin was 14%. It was flat to last year, but still represented an advance of 120 basis points over the pre-pandemic level in 2019, and that was against 50 basis points of negative currency and acquisition dilution. The specialty torque business within C&amp;I really is making significant strides. Torque is hot, and Snap-on is a widening array of new offerings to prominently participate in that trend. Products like our new series of digital torque checkers. It's from our Norbar engineering team. You might remember we acquired Norbar a few years ago.Our Norbar engineering team in England, more compact and easier to use, it helps technicians validate the accuracy of torque instruments close to the workplace, saving a lot of time. Our new checkers accommodate torque measurements from 5-inch pounds to 1,500 foot pounds and rent is from a quarter inch to 1-inch covering jobs from precision fasteners and a jet cockpit to a heavy-duty bolt on a giant oil rig, a wide range of applications. And it's compact steel how they easily mount in a variety -- this is compact steel housing easily mounts in a variety of convenient locations at the point of issuing or in the pathway of the workflow, like tool cribs, aviation hangars and manufacturing cells, making torque checking an easy exercise. With an accuracy of plus or minus 1%, our new checker increases process quality without work interruption, raises consistency in assembly activity and, with a streamlined documentation feature, greatly improves the management of fastening in any application.The initial launch was well received by any operation that relies on precision torque, and there are a lot of them. And as you can imagine, the new checker is right on track to be a Snap-on hit product with sales of $1 million in the first year. So it looks like it's a pretty strong product for us. C&amp;I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds, but it did have significant areas of improvement paving the way for future growth. Now on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $542.7 million, up $37.9 million, including 9.5% in unfavorable currency and a 9.6% organic increase, gains in the U.S. operation and continued expansion in the international networks. And it was all led by big ticket items, tool storage and diagnostics both with double-digit gains.Operating earnings for the Tools Group were $116.1 million in the quarter, $5.6 million above 2021, and that included $4.5 million in unfavorable currency. The operating margin was 21.4%, 50 basis points below last year, but that was impacted by currency and by product mix, but it was still a result of considerable strength. Tools Group again represents the ongoing power and market leadership of our van network. It's written across the financials. And that positivity is clearly an boldly echoed in the voices of our franchisees. I can tell you, I was just at one of our annual kickoff. It's unmistakable that they're pumped enthusiastic and confidence. They know they are growing. And they firmly believe there's more to be had. And our franchisee health metrics confirm all of that to be true.The quantitative trajectory delays in that data supports every bit of the positivity -- of the positive attitude. And the franchisees expressed their excitement in more formal ways. During the quarter, we were recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which surveys franchisee satisfaction. And it's the latest ranking that publication, once again, latest annual ranking -- that publication once again listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 16th consecutive year we received that award. And internationally, Snap-on was ranked #1, #1 in Elite Franchisees Magazine's Top U.K. Franchises for 2023, finishing not only above the U.K.-only franchise systems, but also coming in ahead of the very popular global brand -- a number of very popular global brands.Now that type of recognition reflects, I think, fundamental strength of our brand business, and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products. As part of that, Snap-on continues to lead the industry with great tool storage innovations designed to improve productivity and allow techs to personalize their workspace. We're the first to market with the LED power top, rightly lighting the greening Snap-on tools like special jewels as each store is accessed. It's quite a sight. It enables the techs to show the pride in their work. And building on that feature, in December, we started shipping the first of our new IRIS tool storage units. It's a 68-inch special edition epic roll cap, which allows the technician to adjust the draw lighting with an infinite array of color selections.It is an eye-catcher coated and great paint paired with red trim, and it also features -- besides its appearance, it also features for the first time a specially lit Snap-on logo nameplate. It's innovative, striking. And as for all epic boxes, all of them, it streams functionality. The power top and the power door provides 10 electrical outlets and 4 USB ports throughout the road that ensures that all the cordless tools, the lights, the accessories are charged and at the ready. It also features our unique speed drawer for smart customizable tool organization. It's a very popular and productive feature in the shops. Convenience, productivity and distinction, the IRIS received an overwhelming reception, helping to drive the landmark tool storage we had just in the fourth quarter -- landmark full storage quarter we had just recently.It shows that pride really is a powerful salesman. You show that every day. Well, that's our Tools Group, booming in the U.S. progressing internationally, continuing the stream of new products, building the brand, enhancing the brand channel and moving forward with momentum. Now for RS&amp;I. In the fourth quarter, our RS&amp;I Group results confirmed what we've been saying all along. Snap-on is well positioned for the ongoing rise in vehicle repair. RS&amp;I sales in the quarter of $437.9 million increased 11.6%, including $9.5 million in unfavorable currency and a 14.3% organic gain, 14.3%, boom shakalaka. That rise was authored by -- it was a great performance, and that rise was authored by double-digit increase in OEM dealerships as manufacturers continue to release new models, invest in new equipment and implement essential tool programs.But our business in the independent garages also expanded nicely with double-digit growth in our undercar equipment and in our diagnostics and repair information products, twin pillars of strength. Shop owners need upgrades to follow the changing car park, and they now have confidence regarding their futures to act on that imperative and Snap-on is ready to help. RS&amp;I operating earnings for the quarter were $110.6 million, up 13.8%. And again, and the operating margin, it was 25.3%, rising 50 basis points over 2021, exhibiting our team's ability to navigate the turbulence, welding Snap-on value creation, connecting with customers, launching innovation executing RCI and doing what they're expected to do: keep raising profitability. One example is our diagnostic business, double-digit growth, led by new products.Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our game-changing handheld diligent diagnostic unit, the . Well, it's selling at a record pace. It's in hardware and in software subscriptions. It's a great unit that again raises the bar for an advanced repair, providing technicians with a powerful health and troubleshooting and diagnostic the most complex of vehicle repairs. Zeus Plus makes those special challenges take up so much shop time appear quick and easy, and the techs are noticing. RS&amp;I, the repair shops are confident seeing a great future, and RS&amp;I has the products to pave their way. Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 8%, 10 quarters of consecutive growth from pre-pandemic levels. Tools Group, demonstrating strength.Organic sales up 9.6% over last year, rising 33.2% from prepandemic levels. RS&amp;I products to meet the needs of the vehicles of today and of tomorrow, activity up 14.3% organically, gains in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, C&amp;I showing potential for growth despite international headwinds, strong momentum in the critical industries with much more to go. And it all drove a 21.5% operating margin for the overall enterprise, rising 50 basis points from last year and an EPS of $4.42 up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?Aldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.559 billion in the quarter increased 4.3% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, partially offset by $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter reflects double-digit gains in the Repair Systems &amp; Information Group, high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group and low single-digit gains in the Commercial and Industrial group. From a geographic perspective, double-digit sales growth in both North and South America more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.5% improved 40 basis points from 48.1% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs.Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 10 basis points from 27.1% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $248 million in the quarter compared to $232.2 million in 2021 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.5% improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Financial services revenue of $88.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $63.9 million decreased to $3.3 million from 2021 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year.Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million in the quarter compared to $299.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings margin of 25.1% was unchanged from last year. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 22.3% last year. Net earnings of $238.9 million or $4.42 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.32 per share from last year levels, representing a 7.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&amp;I group on Slide 7. Sales of $343.2 million decreased from $358.7 million last year, reflecting a $5.7 million or 1.7% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $21.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, gains in sales to heavy-duty fleets, mining and general industry more than offset lower activity with the military. Gross margin of 37.7% improved 120 basis points from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, benefits from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher material and other input costs.Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% in the quarter increased 120 basis points from 22.5% in 2021, mostly due to reduced sales and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&amp;I segment of $47.9 million compared to $50.1 million last year. The operating margin of 14% was unchanged from last year. Turning to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $542.7 million compared to $504.8 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. The quarter benefited from robust demand for our recently launched diagnostic platform as well as our tool storage product line.Gross margin of 43.2% in the quarter declined 70 basis points from 43.9% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of lower gross margin products and higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volume and pricing actions. As a reminder, the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products such as diagnostics, which is made by our RS&amp;I Group. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.8% improved 20 basis points from 22% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116.1 million compared to $110.5 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 21.9% in 2021.Turning to the RS&amp;I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $437.9 million increased 11.6% from $392.5 million in 2021, reflecting a 14.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment in activity with OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, including those diagnostic sales affected by the Snap-on Tools Group. Gross margin of 45% declined 110 basis points from 46.1% last year, primarily due to a higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 80 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects.Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.7% improved 160 basis points from 21.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&amp;I group of $110.6 million compared to $97.2 million last year. The operating margin of 25.3% improved 50 basis points from 24.8% reported a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $88.3 million, including a $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $63.9 million, including $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $67.2 million in 2021. Financial Services expenses of $24.4 million were up $4.7 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $4.8 million of higher provisions for credit losses.Bolts, Tools, Screws, HardwarePhoto by Tekton on UnsplashWhile provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that the loan portfolio trends remain stable. For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $12.8 million as compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter last year, yet lower than the $14.1 million and the $16 million recorded in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.1% and 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.7%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively.The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year. Total loan originations of $299.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $43.4 million or 16.9% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 17% increase in originations of finance receivables, a 16.7% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable originations reflects the continued strong sales of big-ticket items by our franchisees during the work. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The total global gross portfolio is up 3.4% year-over-year. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit was the same as in 2021 and compared to 1.8% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019.On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.8 million represented 2.4% of of outstandings at year-end. While this was up 6 basis points from a year ago, it is 47 basis points lower than year-end 2019. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $210.6 million in the quarter compared to $222.7 million last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a 36.5% -- $36.5 million increase in working investment, partially offset by improved net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $67.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $47.3 million and capital expenditures of $22.7 million.Net cash used by financing activities of $145.8 million included cash dividends of $86 million and the repurchase of 284,000 shares of common stock for $65.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $362.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $79.4 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end and to 67 days as of the pre-pandemic year end of 2019. Inventories increased $229.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and the 2.6x as of year-end 2019.The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products. Additionally, given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts, components and raw materials are up, as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods. Our year-end cash position of $757.2 million compared to $780 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 9% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance.I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?Nicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter and our year. I would say we can characterize particularly the fourth quarter as a period where the hits just kept on coming: sporadic supply shortages, war, Brexit, lockdowns, virus explosion and a constant drumbeat of recession warnings that served up bad news for breakfast every day. You can also describe the recent path of the time when Snap-on clearly demonstrated the resilience of its markets and the power of its businesses. C&amp;I. engaging the full range of challenges across sectors and geographies but overcoming, growing 1.7% organically, registering an OI margin of 14%, flat to last year, reflecting the turbulence of the moment but up 120 basis points from pre-pandemic levels.The Tools Group, big ticket items surging, organic sales growing 9.6% overall, OI margin at 21.4%, up big from pre-pandemic levels, down from last year but primarily due to 40 points of negative currency and a similar impact from less favorable product mix. Still strong. RS&amp;I, success in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, sales of 14.3% organically and an OI margin of 25.3%, up 50 basis points from last year. We said we're well positioned for the comeback and repair shops, and RS&amp;I is showing just that. And the credit company, OI down, but finance originations growing a strong 17%, and all of it authored strong numbers for the corporation. Organic sales up 8% versus last year, 22.7% versus pre-pandemic levels. OI margin of 21.5%, 21.5%, up 50 basis points compared with 2021 and 360 basis points over 2019.Full year organic sales were up the OI margin for the year was 20.9%, a rise of 90 basis points. And finally, EPS for the quarter of $4.42, up 7.8% versus last year and 43.5% versus prepandemic levels. The hits did just keep coming, but Snap-on overcame. We exited the year stronger than when we entered, and we left the quarter in December with greater position and strength than we had in early October. We do have momentum, and you can see it in the numbers. We believe our markets will remain resilient, offer ongoing and abundant opportunities, and with our inherent advantages, the breadth and quality of our products. the unique and aspirational nature of our brands and the considerable capabilities of our experienced team, we believe we will maintain the momentum and extend our ongoing positive trajectory throughout 2023 and well beyond.Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are listening. You are the people of work, the individuals whose contributions collectively fostered these results. As I look back over the quarter, over 2022 and, in fact, over the past 3 years, it's clear your efforts, as you met the justifiable fear with extraordinary vigilance, helped keep our society and our company from disintegrating while we engaged and prevailed against the COVID. We often say that Snap-on people are unique, special and consistently make a difference. The past 3 years have clearly proved its so. For your ongoing achievement in the past quarter and many others, you have my congratulations.For your continued dedication in enabling the work of our society, you have my admiration. And for your confident commitment to Snap-on and its future, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of 12.9% since the start of the year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.62 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.51%. This compares to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.19% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.61%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 34%, which means it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $16.89 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 0.42%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Tamara Erwin, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$49.77 per share.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds. First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSE:FDL) is based on the 100 highest yielding stocks that have a history of consistently paying dividends and the ability to continue doing so in the future. The stocks in the Index are weighted based on the total dividends available to investors, and ESG criteria is not considered in the Index calculation. In a world with higher and unpredictable interest rates and inflation, it is likely that investors will seek more stability and return on investment, making dividend-paying stocks more attractive. As a result, the appeal of dividends may increase as investors move away from riskier investments. This shift toward a focus on dividends could be driven by the desire for a steady and reliable source of income, given the uncertain economic conditions. Value stocks are typically associated with established industries, and the focus is on current cash flow and dividends rather than capital growth. Consequently, dividends can play a significant role in driving returns for value stocks, often more so than capital gains.In mid-December, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Bloomberg TV that China reopening could lead to an influx in demand, which would raise the CPI globally and interest rates will continue to rise until inflation is controlled. This could be a bad indicator for stocks in 2023 too. He noted that while the US is experiencing a manufacturing recession, the service sector is going strong, which is different from the overall recessions faced in 2008 and 2020. Kleintop said that despite extreme volatility in 2022, high dividend paying stocks have been an effective strategy to protect investment portfolios, as they outperformed on the downside and in the fourth quarter. Even in a sector as battered as tech, the highest dividend payers are outperforming, and this trend has been observed in the United States, Asia, Canada, and Europe, as per Kleintop. He advised investors to follow the same dividend strategy to deal with a tumultuous 2023 as well. Story continuesSome of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Citigroup Inc.

We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are available here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the market’s multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x – 20x (+/-1 standard deviation).

Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.12. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Dividend Yield as of February 3: 11.71% Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company that explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas.

He is optimistic about Pioneer as he believes the company will enhance its capital efficiency by prioritizing higher-return projects in 2023.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10.

(NYSE:UPS) at the end of Q3 2022, up from 38 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”8.

(NASDAQ:GILD) to $111 from $104 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst sees potential for guidance to exceed expectations for both Trodelvy and Veklury.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”7. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Dividend Yield as of February 3: 5.90% Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is a New York-based alternative asset management firm specializing in real estate, private equity, hedge fund solutions, credit, secondary funds of funds, public debt and equity, and multi-asset class strategies. On January 26, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) declared a $0.91 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.1% increase from its prior dividend of $0.90. The dividend is payable on February 13, to shareholders of record on February 6. It is one of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds. On January 27, Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $100 from $86 and reiterated an Equal Weight rating on the shares following the Q4 results. According to the analyst, Blackstone Inc.

Despite some short-term challenges, the analyst remains optimistic about the company's growth prospects.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assetsWe recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team.Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”6.

(NYSE:VZ) is a New York-based company that offers communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide.

(NYSE:VZ) but lowered the price target on the shares to $49 from $55.

(NYSE:VZ) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 58 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter.

If you want to read about some more hot tech stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now.2022 was a challenging year for the tech industry and the economy as a whole, with high and persistent inflation causing significant growth and performance issues. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an easing and printing of money that had a steroid-like effect on the economy. However, in 2022, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates at a rapid pace and implemented measures such as quantitative tightening, the economy returned to its pre-pandemic state and faced significant challenges.In 2022, the tech industry composite, NASDAQ, ended the year down 32.96%. The year 2022 saw significant losses, with tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) witnessing a decline in their stocks after announcing their earnings. The overall losses in the market have resulted in a combined loss of $3 trillion in market capitalization, mainly from a handful of leading stocks. Apple was the leading company in the tech industry ending the year 2022 with a market capitalization of $2.05 trillion.For 2023, the outlook is somewhat positive, a report from Gartner forecasts a 2.4% growth in worldwide IT spending. The report suggests that the industry may recover in the upcoming year, providing hope for investors and stakeholders in the tech sector. The tech industry is expected to increase its growth, with a focus on digital transformation and the integration of emerging technologies, according to another recent report. Investment in digital transformation is expected to reach a staggering $6.8 trillion by 2023.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital, and companies are expected to continue investing in technology to improve their operations and customer experiences. The increasing demand for remote work and online shopping has also led to a rise in demand for devices such as laptops and smartphones. A report by TrendForce projects that the global 5G market will reach a value of $14.5 billion in 2023, driven by the promotion of 5G private networks by enterprises and the upgrading of equipment for small cells and 5G FWA (fixed wireless access).Story continuesThe growth of wearables faced challenges in 2022, with a 6.9% decrease in global shipments according to the IDC Tracker. The demand for wearables was impacted by factors such as rising inflation, concerns about a potential recession, increased spending on non-tech categories, and the rapid growth experienced in the market in the previous two years. However, the market is expected to bounce back in 2023, driven by a rise in demand for watches and hearables from new buyers in emerging markets and replacement purchases in mature markets.2023 has seen a sharp uptrend since the start of the year, NASDAQ tech index has risen 8.8% and reached a market cap of $18.219 trillion. Most tech firms have seen growth. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee’s rate hike decision on February 1 is also highly anticipated as it can greatly impact the stock prices of tech companies and the tech sector overall.Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify tech stocks that have gained at least 5% year to date in 2023 and have an average 3-month volume of more than 5 million as of January 31. From this resultant dataset we picked the stocks with highest volumes and share price gains.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like McKesson (NYSE:MCK). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson How Fast Is McKesson Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.

This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.09% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Story continuesDoes McKesson Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?McKesson's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends McKesson (MCK) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this prescription drug distributor a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for McKesson is 16.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.1%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, McKesson has an S/TA ratio of 4.36, which means that the company gets $4.36 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.76, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And McKesson is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.4% this year versus the industry average of 1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for McKesson. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.2% over the past month.Bottom LineMcKesson has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that McKesson is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company now expects reported revenues to be between $1.170 billion and $1.220 billion for full-year 2023, implying growth of 14.3% over 2022. Previously, it expected revenues to be between $1.170 billion and $1.230 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $1.21 billion.Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected in the range of $3.20-$3.45 compared with the previous expectation of $3.20-$3.50. Current EPS guidance indicates an anticipated improvement of 20.8-30.2% year-over-year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $3.37.It expects foreign exchange to have unfavorable impact on the top line growth by 150 and 200 basis points in 2023. EPS is likely to be impacted negatively by 20-25 cents due to currency rates.Shares of CONMED were down 4.1% during after-hours trading on Feb 2, following the significantly lower-than-expected earnings, and lower revenues and EPS outlook for 2023. However, the company’s shares have gained 5.7% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOur TakeCONMED exited the fourth quarter on a weaker note, wherein earnings and revenues missed their respective consensus mark significantly. The current decline in revenues and EPS is most likely due to the implementation of the new system, which hampered the company’s ability to ship customer orders. Although the disruption during the implementation phase will gradually improve, duration of the system’s successful integration is yet to be seen. The company is steadily resolving the issues and clearing its backlog of orders created due to the software-related disruption. Management, on the fourth-quarter earning,s call stated that the company’s global shipping volumes are at or above normal daily volumes. We expect sales and EPS to improve significantly as the system-related disruption wanes.Meanwhile, the acquisition of In2Bones and Biorez last year is likely to bring additional sales for CONMED in 2023. Revenues from these two companies’ businesses exceeded management’s expectation so far.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, CONMED carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

264,0928d9f3-b32b-3a6b-b54c-68b062303fcf,MCK,2023-02-04,5 Dental Supplies Stocks to Buy Amid Recovering Prospects,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dental-supplies-stocks-buy-132401846.html,1675430641,STORY,"['CAH', 'LH', 'MCK', '^GSPC', 'MMSI', 'ABC']","[The COVID-19 pandemic — an unprecedented biological crisis — altered the nature and dynamics of the healthcare industry. The Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry bore the brunt of the closure of dental practices and lower patient visits due to the risk of exposure to the virus. However, the dental market has experienced substantial recovery, primarily owing to the easing of prior restrictions and mass vaccinations. Apart from this, rising dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics, teledentistry, and an increase in the number of patient visits are likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. Going by Market Research Future data available on GlobeNewswire, the global dental industry is expected to reach $60.37 billion by 2023, seeing a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% from 2022 to 2030.However, inflationary, labor-shortage and supply-chain headwinds are hurting the margins of the industry players. These headwinds are likely to continue in 2023, subduing earnings growth. Industry participants like McKesson MCK, AmerisourceBergen ABC, Laboratory Corp. of America LH or LabCorp, Cardinal Health CAH and Merit Medical Systems MMSI have shown resiliency despite uncertain conditions and are likely to gain from the existing opportunities.Industry DescriptionThis industry primarily comprises designers, developers, manufacturers and marketers of dental consumables, dental laboratory products and dental specialty items. Some of the industry participants also provide practice management and clinical software, patient education systems, and office forms and stationery. Dental stocks have been gaining significant attention post the weakness witnessed during the pandemic-induced disruptions. This space has continued to show signs of recovery and held its ground. Notably, dental care is being delivered safely, following the guidance and recommendations of the American Dental Association (“ADA”) and CDC. Backed by the rebound witnessed by the companies in this space, patient volume continues to see an encouraging increase despite the COVID-19 uncertainty.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Dental Supplies IndustryRising Dependence on Teledentistry: Following the COVID-19 outbreak, most dental practices were unable to offer routine services in the office. Teledentistry, which is a provision to offer dental services through interactive video, audio or other electronic media to provide consultation, diagnosis and treatment, helped clinicians and patients amid this crisis. The dependence on teledentistry is expected to continue even as the pandemic subsides, as it enhances patient care. The introduction of digital solutions has helped dental professionals to conduct video consultations with existing patients, thereby enhancing treatment efficiency.Digital Influence: The latest technologies help dentists in carrying out minimally-invasive procedures that ensure precision and efficiency, thereby reducing patients’ trauma. The industry players actively promote digital workflows for general dentistry and dental specialties. Further, dental 3D printers are revolutionizing dentistry. These reduce time and cost through efficient utilization of orthodontics and dental practices. Notably, dental 3D printers became mainstream in 2020.AI &amp; Robotics: AI has been shaping the dental industry for quite some time now. This decade is likely to see the rise of computing power, which has become more accessible and affordable for dental practitioners. It will transform the way dentists work, and patients receive treatment, especially with the introduction of robot dentists. Robots are now able to perform minimally-invasive dental work like filling cavities and extracting teeth. A report by National Business Capital &amp; Services suggests that AI dentistry had already become mainstream by 2019-end.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Dental Supplies industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #99, which places it in the top 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $4.66 and $7.36 billion, respectively.For the fourth quarter, the consensus estimate for CMI’s earnings per share has moved down by 32 cents in the past 30 days. Its bottom-line estimates, however, imply a rise of 64% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 26%. Over the trailing four quarters, CMI surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed twice, with the average negative surprise being 4.69%. This is depicted in the graph below:Cummins Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCummins Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCummins Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cummins Inc. QuoteQ3 HighlightsIn third-quarter 2022, CMI’s adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 declined from $3.69 in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.88. Weaker-than-expected EBITDA in the Engine, Distribution, Components and New Power segments resulted in the underperformance. Cummins’ revenues totaled $7,333 million, up 22.8% from $5,968 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,958.2 million.Factors to Shape Q4 ResultsThe acquisition of Meritor provided Cummins a strong footing as it brought forth lucrative growth opportunities across its range of power solutions and applications. While this is expected to boost the upcoming results, near-term challenges might have offset the same partially.On its last earnings call, Cummins acknowledged that the global microchip deficit posed challenges for the firm and that it doesn’t expect the supply chain constraints to go away anytime soon. The supply base is tight not just for semiconductors but also for other components and this is likely to have weighed on the company’s near-term performance. Further, labor shortages, logistical bottlenecks, elevated freight and transportation costs are expected to have put pressure on the firm’s margins.Story continuesAlso, a boost to its capabilities in fuel cell and hydrogen production technology has made R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses spiral. Additionally, the company’s New Power segment is suffering from continuous losses amid high product and technology-related expenses for the past several quarters. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, hurting margins.Here’s a brief look at the revenue and EBITDA estimates for Cummins’ segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales of the Engine segment is pegged at $2,660 million, suggesting a decline from $2,779 million reported in the third-quarter of 2022. However, the consensus mark for the segment’s EBITDA is $432 million, implying an increase from $363 recorded in the previous quarter.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Distribution segment is $2,092 million, indicating a decline of 6.5% sequentially. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBITDA is $225 million, in line with the level reported in the third quarter of 2022.For the quarter under discussion, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales from the Power System segment is $1,154 million, suggesting a fall from $1,349 million recorded in third-quarter 2022. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBITDA is $127 million, implying a contraction from $193 million generated in the previous quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,058 million for the Components segment’s quarterly net sales implies an increase from the last reported quarter’s $2,703 million. The consensus estimate for the segment’s EBITDA is pegged at $421 million, indicating a rise from $297 million recorded in third-quarter 2022.For the New Power segment, the consensus estimate for revenues is $62 million, indicating a rise from $50 million recorded in the last reported quarter. The consensus mark for pretax loss from the segment is pegged at $78 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cummins for the quarter to be reported, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: CMI has an Earnings ESP of -5.66%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 26 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks With the Favorable CombinationWhile an earnings beat is uncertain for Cummins, here are a few stocks from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Adient plc ADNT will release fiscal first-quarter 2023 results on Feb 7.

And investors may be pondering what lies ahead for the media and entertainment conglomerate.Let’s take a look at what’s going on with Disney stock in the week leading up to its fiscal Q1 report.Momentum After a tremulous 2022 for many tech and consumer discretionary stocks, these equities have rallied to start the new year as signs of inflation beginning to ease have served as a catalyst along with the possibility of a less hawkish fed.This has led to Disney and Netflix NFLX, its primary competitor in terms of streaming content, both skyrocketing in the last month, with their Consumer Discretionary sector up +18% year to date. Still, Disney’s performance over the last three months has lagged behind its Consumer Discretionary peers, making its fiscal Q1 report crucial to regaining its dominance in the sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus for Disney’s Q1 earnings is $0.69 per share, which would be a -35% decline from Q1 2022 EPS of $1.06. Also, with the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.67 per share, this indicates that Disney could fall short on its bottom-line expectations by -3.37%.On the top line, Q1 sales are forecasted to be $23.33 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. This reflects that Disney continues to struggle with tougher operating conditions and broader economic challenges as its bottom line is expected to dip despite YoY quarterly sales growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverall, Disney earnings are expected to rise 9% in FY23 and climb another 36% in FY24 at $5.27 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline over the last quarter. Sales are forecasted to be up 9% in FY23 and rise another 7% in FY24 to $97.11 billion. Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSubscriber Growth Along with overall top and bottom-line growth, Wall Street will be monitoring the growth of Disney’s streaming services among its Direct-to-Consumer segment. While its Direct to Consumer services are not profitable yet, subscriber growth has been very intriguing in terms of the long-term outlook it could have for the company.However, last quarter the operating loss among the segment increased from - $0.8 billion to -$1.5 billion, and it will be important to see if Disney was able to contract these losses during Q1.The increase in the operating loss was due to a higher loss among Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu. Still, the subscriber growth among Disney+ in particular continues to be compelling following its launch in 2019 with the service striving to rival Netflix subscriptions.During Q4, Disney+ subscribers grew by 8% to 164.2 million with the company stating the service should be profitable when it reaches 260 million subscribers. Disney estimates it could hit this target by 2024 and eventually dethrone Netflix as the king of subscription videos on demand (SVODs).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation &amp; Historical PerformanceTrading at $110 per share and 28.5X forward earnings, Disney stock trades nicely below its decade-long high of 134.4X and closer to the median of 19.8X with its industry average at 25.2X.Over the last year, Disney stock is still down -21% to underperform the Consumer Discretionary sectors -16%, while also lagging the S&amp;P 500’ and Netflix’s -8% performances. In the last decade, Disney’s +105% has also trailed the benchmark, and Netflix’s stellar +1363% performance but topped the Consumer Discretionary sectors’ +51%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineHeading into its fiscal Q1 report, Disney stock lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the moment. This is in correlation with the declining earnings estimates for the current quarter, Fiscal 2023, and FY24. After such an impressive start to the new year Disney stock may be due for a pullback and there could be better opportunities despite the stock still trading attractively relative to its past.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Morgan Pounds the Table on These 2 Reliable Dividend Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-p-morgan-pounds-table-142226637.html,1675434146,STORY,"['BEP', 'OKE']","[The year has started well for stock market investors, no doubt of that. The S&amp;P 500 has jumped 9%, and the NASDAQ is up nearly 17%. While this doesn’t reverse last year’s losses, the gains, prompted by several releases of positive economic data, do indicate a shift to more positive investor sentiment.But there is always a voice of caution, and today it’s coming from JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, who warns that the stock rally likely won’t last – and that it has only postponed, not ended, the risk of a recession later this year.Kolanovic sees an underlying weakness in current economic conditions, a weakness that is aggravated by the Federal Reserve’s policy of interest rate hikes. The central bank’s key funds rate is currently set in the range of 4.5% to 4.75%, after a 25-basis point increase announced on February 1.“Unless the Fed starts cutting its nominal policy rates, these restrictive real policy rates would represent an ongoing headwind, keeping the risk of an eventual recession later in the year relatively high,” Kolanovic opined.From a practical investment standpoint, this describes a situation made for defensive portfolios. The analysts at JPM clearly think so, as they have been tapping reliable dividend stocks as likely buys.We’ve dipped into the TipRanks data to find out the latest details on two of JPM’s picks; they both feature reliable payment histories, supported by a firm corporate commitment to maintaining the dividend. Let's take a closer look.Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)The first stock we’ll look at is Brookfield Renewable, a pure-play renewable power platform – and the world’s largest such company. Brookfield Renewable, which is 60% owned by the $75 billion Brookfield Asset Management, has focused on building a portfolio of wind, hydro, and utility-scale solar energy facilities, along with energy storage assets. The company is active in the Americas, in Europe, and in Asia; it operates some 25,400 megawatts of installed generation capacity and can make 8 million tons per year of carbon capture.Story continuesBrookfield Renewable has just released its 4Q22 and full-year 2022 results. Revenues for the quarter were listed as ~$1.2 billion, up ~10% year-over-year. Earnings for 4Q22 came in at a 16-cent EPS loss, 33% deeper than the 12-cent loss from 4Q21, and slightly worse than consensus forecasts of (0.15). However, the company had solid funds from operations; at $225 million, this metric was up $11 million from the prior-year quarter. On a per-share basis, the FFO came to 35 cents, compared to 33 cents the previous year.During that last reported quarter, Brookfield continued its expansion activities, and commissioned new projects totaling some 3,500 megawatts.This company has committed to paying out – and to maintaining – a reliable dividend payment to common shareholders. The last declaration, at 0.3375 per share, was made with the Q4 release, and will be paid out on March 31, 2023. The dividend annualizes to $1.35 per common share and gives a yield of 4.3%, about double the average yield found among div payers in the broader markets. Brookfield Renewables has been gradually increasing its dividend payment over the past several years.JPM analyst Mark Strouse, who holds a 5-star rating from TipRanks, points out that renewable energy is a rapidly growing field, and that Brookfield Renewable Corporation holds a leading position in it. He writes, “We believe BEPC, along with related company Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), is best in class in the development and ownership of renewable projects, offering high-quality cash yield and good visibility into growth. We believe this stock should appeal to investors seeking long-term exposure to the secular growth theme of renewable energy.”Taking this view and running with it, Strouse rates BEPC shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his price target, now set at $39, implies a one-year upside potential of ~25% for the stock. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~30% potential total return profile (To watch Strouse’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has managed to slip under the radar, and there are only 2 recent analyst reviews on file – but they both agree that this is a stock to Buy, making the Moderate Buy consensus unanimous. The shares are trading for $31.27, and their $38 average price target suggest that a gain of 21.5% lies ahead or BEPC. (See BEPC stock forecast)Oneok, Inc. (OKE)Now we’ll turn our focus from renewables to hydrocarbons. Oneok is a midstream company operating in the natural gas industry, where its network of assets connects natural gas liquid suppliers in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, and Permian Basin regions with vital marketing and distribution centers. In addition, the company is expanding its footprint to include operations in the rich Bakken region of the northern Plains. Oneok’s assets include infrastructure for the gathering, processing, storage, and transport of natural gas liquids.The company has posted generally rising revenues and earnings over the past year. We’ll have to wait for February 27 to see the most recent quarterly results, but the last report, from 3Q22, showed a net income of $431.8 million, up 10% year-over-year. On a per-share basis, the gain was similar, as diluted EPS rose 9% y/y to reach 96 cents. These gains were supported by solid increases in the company’s Rocky Mountain regional business, which saw a 9% increase natural gas volumes processed and a 17% increase in NGL raw feed throughput volumes.A hint that current performance remains sound comes from the recent dividend declaration, for a common share dividend to be paid out on February 14. The payment, for 95.5 cents per common share, represents a 2% payment increase over the previous quarter. At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $3.82 per share and gives a yield of 5.6%. This is almost triple the overall average dividend yield, and more than triple the yield found among peer companies. More importantly, Oneok’s dividend history stretches back decades, and the company has a reputation for always making the quarterly payments.Going forward, Oneok can look for a smooth path, as last month the company announced an insurance settlement to close out all claims related to the ‘Medford incident.’ That event – an explosion and fire at the gas plant in Medford, Oklahoma that forced evacuations of homes and businesses – has been weighing on Oneok since last summer. The insurance settlement, totaling $930 million, officially puts all claims to rest.What this means, for investors, is that Oneok is a much more reliable stock now than six months ago. Jeremy Tonet, of JPM, explains: “In a notable derisking event, OKE also announced a resolution to the Medford facility incident, not only removing an overhang on the stock but also surprising expectations to the upside, in our view…. Despite currently trading at a somewhat fuller valuation, OKE’s leverage to the Bakken, with a supportive fundamental environment for the basin and ethane upside optionality, presents a favorable risk reward profile, in our view, especially given the lack of direct natural gas price exposure.”This favorable risk-reward profile earns the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating from Tonet, whose price target of $75 suggests a one-year gain of 9% for the stock. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here)Overall, OKE's Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 4 Buys and 8 Holds. Shares are currently trading for $68.71, and the $72.83 average target suggests ~6% upside.

It is worth considering Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry.This cloud services provider has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.75%.For the most recent quarter, Akamai Technologies was expected to post earnings of $1.23 per share, but it reported $1.26 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.44%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.31 per share, while it actually produced $1.35 per share, a surprise of 3.05%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Akamai Technologies, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Akamai Technologies has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 14, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.9%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Juniper Networks' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Based on the last payment, Juniper Networks' earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 40.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 47%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendJuniper Networks Is Still Building Its Track RecordThe dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 8 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.88. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. Juniper Networks has been growing its dividend quite rapidly, which is exciting. However, the short payment history makes us question whether this performance will persist across a full market cycle.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Juniper Networks has impressed us by growing EPS at 12% per year over the past five years. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.In SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

The downside is likely to have been partially offset by higher net investment spread results and lower expenses.Individual life sales are likely to have decreased in the to-be-reported quarter due to lower net investment spread results.

(NYSE:PRU) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Prudential FinancialThe Chairman, Charles Lowrey, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$120 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$103. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Prudential Financial didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Prudential Financial Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Prudential Financial shares. In total, insiders dumped US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Prudential Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Prudential Financial insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$49m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Prudential Financial Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds. First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSE:FDL) is based on the 100 highest yielding stocks that have a history of consistently paying dividends and the ability to continue doing so in the future. The stocks in the Index are weighted based on the total dividends available to investors, and ESG criteria is not considered in the Index calculation. In a world with higher and unpredictable interest rates and inflation, it is likely that investors will seek more stability and return on investment, making dividend-paying stocks more attractive. As a result, the appeal of dividends may increase as investors move away from riskier investments. This shift toward a focus on dividends could be driven by the desire for a steady and reliable source of income, given the uncertain economic conditions. Value stocks are typically associated with established industries, and the focus is on current cash flow and dividends rather than capital growth. Consequently, dividends can play a significant role in driving returns for value stocks, often more so than capital gains.In mid-December, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Bloomberg TV that China reopening could lead to an influx in demand, which would raise the CPI globally and interest rates will continue to rise until inflation is controlled. This could be a bad indicator for stocks in 2023 too. He noted that while the US is experiencing a manufacturing recession, the service sector is going strong, which is different from the overall recessions faced in 2008 and 2020. Kleintop said that despite extreme volatility in 2022, high dividend paying stocks have been an effective strategy to protect investment portfolios, as they outperformed on the downside and in the fourth quarter. Even in a sector as battered as tech, the highest dividend payers are outperforming, and this trend has been observed in the United States, Asia, Canada, and Europe, as per Kleintop. He advised investors to follow the same dividend strategy to deal with a tumultuous 2023 as well. Story continuesSome of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Dividend Yield as of February 3: 3.87% U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a financial services holding company, offering various financial services to individuals, businesses, institutions, government entities, and other financial institutions in the United States.

(NYSE:UPS) to $195 from $187 and kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. According to the analyst, management anticipates a challenging first half of 2023, followed by a recovery in the second half as they address declining volumes. United Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) at the end of Q3 2022, up from 38 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”8.

(NASDAQ:GILD) to $111 from $104 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst sees potential for guidance to exceed expectations for both Trodelvy and Veklury.

(NASDAQ:GILD), compared to 58 funds in the last quarter.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”7. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Dividend Yield as of February 3: 5.90% Blackstone Inc.

The dividend is payable on February 13, to shareholders of record on February 6.

Despite some short-term challenges, the analyst remains optimistic about the company's growth prospects.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assetsWe recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team.Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”6. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Dividend Yield as of February 3: 6.29% Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a New York-based company that offers communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide. On January 24, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.19, in-line with market estimates. The revenue of $35.3 billion climbed 3.5% year-over-year, beating Wall Street consensus by $160 million. On January 25, Cowen analyst Gregory Williams reiterated an Outperform rating on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) but lowered the price target on the shares to $49 from $55. According to the analyst, Verizon's Q4 results were mixed and initial 2023 guidance was muted due to pressure from promotion amortization costs and interest expenses, which offset the benefits of price hikes, strong Fixed Wireless Access, and good Business Wireless performance.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 58 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:VZ) is one of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds. Here is what Mawer Investment Management has to say about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as wireless operators are spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:21 Best Dating Apps of 202315 Largest Steel Producing Countries in the World15 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now Disclosure: None. 15 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Built on the foundation that data drives performance, Oracle Red Bull Racing will increase its use of Oracle Cloud to power new fan engagement opportunities - including an incredible chance to design the livery on their new car, the RB19. The Team will also further extend its competitive advantage on the track with billions of simulations that help sharpen decisions of the grid's best race strategists. In addition, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) will be supporting Red Bull Powertrains with cutting-edge compute capabilities for its development work towards the 2026 season.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)Oracle Cloud powers Oracle Red Bull Racing's Success On and Off the Track""Oracle Cloud helped us to our championship wins in 2021 and 2022, and we know it will give our fans, the team, and our drivers even more to get excited about this season,"" said Oracle Red Bull Racing Team Principal and CEO Christian Horner. ""We rely on Oracle to deliver insight from data that helps us make more informed, effective and faster decisions on and off the track. From race strategy to fan engagement – and as a critical part of our Red Bull Powertrains infrastructure – Oracle is an integral part of our success as an organization.""Paddock members design their way into the history booksWhile the Oracle Red Bull Racing team captured win after win on the track in 2022, Oracle helped the team win more fans with its unique fan engagement platform, The Paddock. Powered by Oracle Cloud Customer Experience (CX) technology, the digital loyalty and rewards-based program saw significant growth in 2022, adding more than 250,000 members and connecting with them through videos, quizzes, and contests that gave fans exclusive behind-the-scenes access and enabled them to interact with the team and build community with other fans. To add even more excitement for fans this year, the team launched a league-first competition that allows Paddock members to design the team's livery for all three American Grand Prix - Miami, Austin, and Las Vegas.Story continues""Oracle technology is built to help customers win,"" said Karan Batta, Vice President, Product, OCI. ""Oracle Red Bull Racing uses the exact same technology that helps organizations around the world and across nearly every industry solve their biggest and most complex challenges.""Nearly 100 billion race strategy simulations improve decisions in 2023Oracle will continue to drive the team's success on the track by powering the technical backbone of the team's race strategy – the billions of computer-generated simulations that enable race strategists to make split-second decisions.  Last year OCI played a vital role in Oracle Red Bull Racing's championship sweep, enabling the team to continuously run race simulations in real-time so drivers could react quickly to the performance of the cars, changes happening on the track, and the decisions of their competitors during the races.In 2022, Oracle reduced the latency and increased the volume and speed of race simulations, which led to a 25% increase in the total number of simulations run. In a sport where every tenth of a second matters and every decision is carefully analyzed under a microscope, having access to an ocean of simulation data, processed instantly, and distilled into actionable strategy, can be the difference between winning and losing. In 2023, the team estimates it will run nearly four billion simulations across a race weekend and close to 100 billion simulations over the course of the season as it uses OCI to secure another world championship.Powering Powertrains simulation with OCIOracle will also work with Red Bull Powertrains as it makes crucial advances in the development of the next-generation hybrid engine that will power the team's cars in the 2026 season. OCI will support elements of the team's high performance computing (HPC) workloads running complex, compute-intensive simulations to model critical elements of the powertrain design.Beyond the upcoming Formula 1 season, Oracle will continue to provide support for Oracle Red Bull Racing Esports. OCI will help the Esports team analyze data to make smarter race decisions and better understand their own performance. It will also power simulation technology to improve driver preparation – just like the Formula 1 team.Additional ResourcesLearn more about Oracle Cloud InfrastructureLearn more about Oracle Fusion Cloud Customer Experience (CX)Learn more about HPC on OCIAbout OracleOracle offers suites of integrated applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

If you want to read about some more hot tech stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now.2022 was a challenging year for the tech industry and the economy as a whole, with high and persistent inflation causing significant growth and performance issues. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an easing and printing of money that had a steroid-like effect on the economy. However, in 2022, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates at a rapid pace and implemented measures such as quantitative tightening, the economy returned to its pre-pandemic state and faced significant challenges.In 2022, the tech industry composite, NASDAQ, ended the year down 32.96%. The year 2022 saw significant losses, with tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) witnessing a decline in their stocks after announcing their earnings. The overall losses in the market have resulted in a combined loss of $3 trillion in market capitalization, mainly from a handful of leading stocks. Apple was the leading company in the tech industry ending the year 2022 with a market capitalization of $2.05 trillion.For 2023, the outlook is somewhat positive, a report from Gartner forecasts a 2.4% growth in worldwide IT spending. The report suggests that the industry may recover in the upcoming year, providing hope for investors and stakeholders in the tech sector. The tech industry is expected to increase its growth, with a focus on digital transformation and the integration of emerging technologies, according to another recent report. Investment in digital transformation is expected to reach a staggering $6.8 trillion by 2023.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital, and companies are expected to continue investing in technology to improve their operations and customer experiences. The increasing demand for remote work and online shopping has also led to a rise in demand for devices such as laptops and smartphones. A report by TrendForce projects that the global 5G market will reach a value of $14.5 billion in 2023, driven by the promotion of 5G private networks by enterprises and the upgrading of equipment for small cells and 5G FWA (fixed wireless access).Story continuesThe growth of wearables faced challenges in 2022, with a 6.9% decrease in global shipments according to the IDC Tracker. The demand for wearables was impacted by factors such as rising inflation, concerns about a potential recession, increased spending on non-tech categories, and the rapid growth experienced in the market in the previous two years. However, the market is expected to bounce back in 2023, driven by a rise in demand for watches and hearables from new buyers in emerging markets and replacement purchases in mature markets.2023 has seen a sharp uptrend since the start of the year, NASDAQ tech index has risen 8.8% and reached a market cap of $18.219 trillion. Most tech firms have seen growth. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee’s rate hike decision on February 1 is also highly anticipated as it can greatly impact the stock prices of tech companies and the tech sector overall.Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify tech stocks that have gained at least 5% year to date in 2023 and have an average 3-month volume of more than 5 million as of January 31. From this resultant dataset we picked the stocks with highest volumes and share price gains.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

294,3914acbc-01a1-3e50-936c-3908a270a191,HAS,2023-02-04,e.l.f. Beauty and Hasbro have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-l-f-beauty-hasbro-130901567.html,1675429741,STORY,"['HAS', 'ELF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 3, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ELF as the Bull of the Day and Hasbro, Inc. HAS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. is operating on all cylinders as consumers are still buying beauty. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) just beat on earnings for the eighth quarter in a row. e.l.f. Beauty is a beauty company with multiple brands including e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. SKIN, clean beauty brand Well People and Keys Soulcare, a lifestyle beauty brand created with Alicia Keys.It sells online and across leading beauty retailers in the United States. The company also has a growing international presence.Another Big Beat in Fiscal Q3On Feb 1, 2023, e.l.f. Beauty reported its fiscal third quarter 2023 results and blew by the Zacks Consensus for the 8th quarter in a row.Earnings were $0.48 versus the Zacks Consensus of just $0.23, for a 108.7% beat.Net sales jumped 49% to $146.5 million, due to strength in both retailer and e-commerce channels. It was the 16th consecutive quarter of net sales growth.Gross margin rose 180 basis points to 67%, primarily driven by price increases, cost savings and product mix, partially offset by inventory adjustments and costs related to space gains and Spring shelf resets.e.l.f. Beauty has improved its balance sheet over the last year.As of Dec 31, 2022, it had $87 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from$32.9 million a year ago. It also had $62.2 million in long-term debt and finance lease obligations at the end of the year, down from $92.5 million as of Dec 31, 2021.e.l.f. Beauty Raised Full Year GuidanceWith the big earnings beat and sales jumping higher, the company raised full year guidance. Net sales are now expected to rise 38% to 39% year-over-year, up from prior guidance of 22%-24% growth.Story continuesThat's a revenue range of $541-$545 million up from $478-$486 million.Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.40 up from previous guidance of $1.07 to $1.10.That is higher than the current Zacks Consensus which just moved up to $1.13 from $1.12 in the last week. But look for further analyst adjustments higher. That's earnings growth over 34% as the company made just $0.84 last year.Stock Soars on Another Earnings BeatShares of e.l.f. Beauty have been on a tear the last 6 months, gaining 99% during that time. They jumped 15% on the big third quarter earnings beat alone.The stock is at 5-year highs.But earnings are also moving in the right direction, which is up.However, you're going to pay the price if you're jumping in here. It's not a cheap stock. e.l.f. Beauty has a forward P/E of 52.Beauty has been one of the hot industries on the reopen and it still has momentum. For those looking for a top ranked beauty company that is still posting big beats, and raising full year guidance, then e.l.f. Beauty is the one for your short list.Bear of the Day:Hasbro, Inc. recently warned on fourth quarter earnings. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) also announced global layoffs.Hasbro is a global branded entertainment leader through gaming, consumer products and entertainment. Some of its brands include Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Hasbro Gaming, Nerf, Transformers, Play-doh and Peppa Pig.Hasbro Warns on Q4 and Full YearOn Jan 26, 2023, Hasbro announced preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and it was below the Zacks Consensus.""Despite strong growth in Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, Hasbro Pulse, and our licensing business, our Consumer Products business underperformed in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of a challenging holiday consumer environment,"" said Chris Cocks, Hasbro chief executive officer.Hasbro gave full year adjusted earnings of $4.43 to $4.45, which was under the Zacks Consensus. In the last week, 3 estimates have been cut for 2022, pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.50 from $4.61. That's still above the range.At $4.50, that's an earnings decline of 14% from last year.3 estimates were also cut for 2023, pushing the 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $4.92 from $5.00. But that would be an earnings rebound of 9.2%.Layoffs and Cost SavingsHasbro also announced leadership and organization changes, including eliminating 1,000 jobs, or approximately 15% of its global workforce. Additionally, President and Chief Operating Officer, Eric Nyman, would be departing and the Consumer Products business would report directly to the CEO.The layoffs will start in the next several weeks.Hasbro expects, with the layoffs as well as the ongoing systems and supply chain investments, to achieve its goal of $250 to $300 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2025 which was announced in Oct 2022.Shares Plunged Over the Last YearGiven the falling earnings estimates and earnings warnings, it's not surprising that shares are down 33%.It will report fourth quarter earnings on Feb 16, 2023. Presumably, there will be some kind of outlook or guidance about Q1 and/or 2023 given then.Shares are cheap, with a forward P/E of 12.2.It also pays a big dividend, currently yielding 4.7%. But I caution investors about chasing yield as earnings are on the decline.Instead, investors might want to wait on the sidelines for a positive turn in the business before jumping in.Additional content:Did Jay Powell Give a Green Light to Stock Investors?Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell addressed the world economy on Wednesday and announced that he and his committee decided to raise the federal funds rate 0.25% to 4.5-4.75%. This was as expected, but the most important bits came during the press conference.Depending on whether you are a bull or bear you may be interpreting what Jerome Powell said in different ways.  The bulls are feeling reassured. Powell acknowledged that “the disinflation process has started,” and how incredibly relieving it is to see that process begin. The bears, however, were focused on his saying that it would be “very premature to declare victory,” over inflation. And that some sectors of the service economy have yet to see any disinflation at all.Bull CaseThe stock market has corrected significantly since the beginning of the rising rates policy and has now discounted the worst. As unlikely as it seemed, it appears Jerome Powell and the Fed have pulled off the goldilocks ‘Soft Landing,’ where they have lowered inflation in such a way that the economy didn’t need to slow significantly, and employment remained robust.One of the most important indicators for the Fed is the ECI (Employment Cost Index), which measures wages. One of the biggest risks for inflation is a wage-price spiral, but the ECI is showing consistent decreases.Looking back at other bear markets we see that earnings always bottom out after the market, because markets are forward-looking. Furthermore, financial conditions have loosened quite significantly already. According to the Financial Conditions Index, economic policy is as loose as it has been in other recent expansionary periods.Bear CaseWhile Jerome Powell has been successful in initiating disinflation, there is no guarantee it will continue to improve. Worse yet, because expectations have become so hopeful about disinflation, even a small miss to the upside on inflation can really shake the markets. What if inflation is stickier than expected?Earnings seem to be coming in around expectations, but that is because analyst expectations were extremely low. What if there is a secondary push lower in the economy just as everyone is getting bullish again?Furthermore, with the now easing conditions of financial markets, and such robust employment, how do we know this won’t reignite inflation?Statistics Favor the Long-TermThese issues are never black and white, and the case can easily be made for bears or bulls. Something the data tells us conclusively is that over the long term, stocks are an extremely good investment. Whether you buy in a bull market or a bear market, the real edge is focusing on owning quality businesses, with improving earnings over the long run.Stocks to WatchSome of the best stocks in the world have been completely battered by the rising rates environment. But that dynamic is slowly switching over. And this may be a great opportunity for investors to start buying stocks still in correction territory. With the Fed easing off the breaks, it’s possible stocks will see a continued rally.Although they will be reporting earnings on Thursday, February 2 after the close, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are hard to ignore at this point. They are extremely dominant, and innovative businesses that have been beaten down significantly.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Brands, Inc. YUM is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.25, indicating a gain of 22.6% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.93 billion, suggesting growth of 2% from $1.89 billion in the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteYum! Brands’ fourth-quarter 2022 performance is likely to have been aided by strong same-store sales growth, expansion efforts and strong off-premise ordering channels. Our estimate showcases an increase of 3.7% to $291.4 million in the Pizza Hut segment for the quarter under discussion. We expect Taco Bell revenues to increase 1.8% year over year to $696.1 million.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseYum! Brands, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Yum! Brands, Inc. QuoteHowever, we expect KFC and Habit Burger revenues to decline 2.8% and 1.9% year over year to $772 million and $128.5 million, respectively.Rising inflation levels are likely to have impacted margins in the to-be-reported quarter. An increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating costs such as rent and energy costs, put significant pressure on the company’s margins.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Yum!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Hedge Funds. First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSE:FDL) is based on the 100 highest yielding stocks that have a history of consistently paying dividends and the ability to continue doing so in the future. The stocks in the Index are weighted based on the total dividends available to investors, and ESG criteria is not considered in the Index calculation. In a world with higher and unpredictable interest rates and inflation, it is likely that investors will seek more stability and return on investment, making dividend-paying stocks more attractive. As a result, the appeal of dividends may increase as investors move away from riskier investments. This shift toward a focus on dividends could be driven by the desire for a steady and reliable source of income, given the uncertain economic conditions. Value stocks are typically associated with established industries, and the focus is on current cash flow and dividends rather than capital growth. Consequently, dividends can play a significant role in driving returns for value stocks, often more so than capital gains.In mid-December, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Bloomberg TV that China reopening could lead to an influx in demand, which would raise the CPI globally and interest rates will continue to rise until inflation is controlled. This could be a bad indicator for stocks in 2023 too. He noted that while the US is experiencing a manufacturing recession, the service sector is going strong, which is different from the overall recessions faced in 2008 and 2020. Kleintop said that despite extreme volatility in 2022, high dividend paying stocks have been an effective strategy to protect investment portfolios, as they outperformed on the downside and in the fourth quarter. Even in a sector as battered as tech, the highest dividend payers are outperforming, and this trend has been observed in the United States, Asia, Canada, and Europe, as per Kleintop. He advised investors to follow the same dividend strategy to deal with a tumultuous 2023 as well. Story continuesSome of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10.

According to the analyst, management anticipates a challenging first half of 2023, followed by a recovery in the second half as they address declining volumes. United Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) at the end of Q3 2022, up from 38 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power.

(NASDAQ:GILD) to $111 from $104 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst sees potential for guidance to exceed expectations for both Trodelvy and Veklury.

It is one of the best dividend leaders to buy according to hedge funds. On January 27, Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $100 from $86 and reiterated an Equal Weight rating on the shares following the Q4 results. According to the analyst, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)’s management sees significant growth potential in the long-term with increased earnings from flagship fundraising, insurance, and perpetual strategies. Despite some short-term challenges, the analyst remains optimistic about the company's growth prospects.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $260.7 million.Baron Funds made the following comment about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was a detractor in the fourth quarter as shares sold off sharply in December after the company announced that it received redemption requests above monthly and quarterly caps in its non-traded REIT fund (BREIT) and would be limiting investor withdrawals. BREIT was one of Blackstone’s fastest-growing flagship retail fund vehicles and hence received outsized investor attention and media coverage. While redemptions themselves aren’t surprising given the stark performance dispersion between BREIT and publicly listed real estate, investors grew concerned that the decision to limit withdrawals would create a cascading effect, eventually force BREIT to liquidate assets and perhaps impair the growth of additional retail fund vehicles. Subsequently, Blackstone increased liquidity through the sale of a JV interest in Las Vegas casino assets at attractive prices and received a $4 billion investment from the University of California. While acknowledging the step back and near-term headwinds, we believe BREIT has plenty of runway to meet redemptions without being forced to liquidate assetsWe recently reduced the size of the Fund’s investment in Blackstone Inc. because of our expectation of a slowdown in its growth outlook. We remain bullish, however, about the company’s long-term prospects. Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion in assets under management and the largest real estate manager in the world. Blackstone has a premier brand, a global franchise, loyal customers, an exceptional balance sheet, and an excellent management team.Following a 36% correction in its shares in 2022, we believe Blackstone’s valuation has become more compelling and may look for opportunities to acquire additional shares in the future.”6.

(NYSE:VZ) but lowered the price target on the shares to $49 from $55.

Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all four occasions, the average beat being 61.05%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, STAAR Surgical is registering growth in EVO Implantable CollamerLenses (EVO) in the APAC region and strong accelerating growth in the United States despite constant currency challenges and in Europe macroeconomic headwinds. This trend is expected to have continued through the fourth quarter on the back of continued strong customer adoption, driving top-line.During the November update, the company noted that it had advanced its patient awareness, engagement and market-building initiatives for EVO in the United States during and subsequent to the third quarter, highlighted by media campaigns with global entertainment celebrities. In this regard, the company has partnered with professional basketball player Max Strus to further its mission of bringing EVO to the millions of Americans who suffer from myopia or nearsightedness. We expect this development to have expanded adoption of EVO lenses, thus adding to revenue growth in Q4.Moreover, the launch of the EVO ICL educational series on YouTube has now expanded to 8 videos as the company added individual videos about Joe and Max’s decision to choose EVO. The EVO ICL channel on YouTube is now approaching 6 million video views. This is also expected to boost the company’s top line during the fourth quarter.STAAR Surgical Company Price and EPS Surprise STAAR Surgical Company Price and EPS SurpriseSTAAR Surgical Company price-eps-surprise | STAAR Surgical Company Quote Meanwhile, in the third quarter, STAAR Surgical achieved strong ICL unit growth in China, Japan, South Korea and the United States, led by a strong recovery in visits by patients seeking visual freedom. We believe this to have continued through the fourth quarter as well on the back of the company’s progress in advancing the adoption of EVO lenses through patient awareness and surgeon engagement.Story continuesDuring third-quarter earnings call, management noted that the tighter COVID restrictions in China, resulting in expected delayed demand, ongoing headwinds in Europe, weakness in the yen and euro and lower other product sales are expected to hurt overall growth in the fourth quarter.The Estimate PictureFor fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $64.4 million implies a rise of 9.1% from the prior-year reported figure.

306,a4d768d3-d3d2-3c5d-a103-b58503aa355d,PPL,2023-02-04,4 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-prospering-electric-141702424.html,1675433822,STORY,"['PPL', 'ED', 'XEL', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Company AEP, with a large investment to expand renewable operations, widespread transmission and distribution assets and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include Xcel Energy XEL, Consolidated Edison ED and PPL Corporation PPL.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years has resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 and 26% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 57 GW and 59 GW to be added in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 and further to 17% in 2024. The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, 2023 electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1% in 2023 and rise more than 1% in 2024, EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 is due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In February 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate a range of 4.50%-4.75%. This is the eighth increase in interest rates since March 2022, with more expected to come in 2023.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Since March 2022, earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up 1.9%. Looking at the upward earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are showing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Utility Electric Power industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 and its own sector over the past 12 months.

If you want to read about some more stocks in the Buffett portfolio, go directly to Buffett Stock Portfolio: Warren Buffett's 5 Recent Buys.American business tycoon, entrepreneur, and investor Warren Edward Buffett presently serves as Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO. He is among the most accomplished investors in the world, and as of February 2023, his net worth was over $108 billion, the fifth-wealthiest human being in the world.  Buffett, the only son of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett, was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930. He was the second of Leila and Howard Buffett's three children. Buffett showed early signs of interest in business and investment. When he was seven years old, he took out the book ‘One Thousand Ways to Make $1000’ from the Omaha Public Library.  Entrepreneurial endeavors kept the early life of Buffett busy and interesting. He sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola, and monthly magazines door to door as one of his early business operations. From 1951 to 1954, Buffett worked as a salesman of investments at Buffett-Falk &amp; Co.; from 1954 to 1956, he was a securities analyst at Graham-Newman Corp.; from 1956 to 1969, he was a general partner at Buffett Partnership, Ltd.; and starting in 1970, he was the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Because of his partnerships, which had excess funds of $7,178,500 in January 1962, of which more than $1,025,000 was owned by Buffett, he became a millionaire that year. He combined these alliances into one. Buffett invested in Berkshire Hathaway, a manufacturer of textiles, and eventually acquired control of it. From Seabury Stanton, the company's owner, who he eventually sacked, he started purchasing shares of Berkshire. At a share price of $7.60, Buffett's partnerships started buying stock. When Buffett's partnerships started actively buying shares in Berkshire in 1965, they did so at a price of $14.86 per share, despite the fact that the business had $19 per share in working cash at the time. Story continuesOn May 29, 1990, Berkshire Hathaway decided to sell class A shares, and the market closed at $7,175 per share. This is when Buffett became a billionaire. The share value of Berkshire Hathaway reached $200,000 per share for the first time on August 14, 2014, valuing the business at $328 billion. By this time, Buffett had donated most of his stock to charitable organizations, but he still owned 321,000 shares, valued at $64.2 billion. For failing to properly disclose the purchase of USG Corporation shares on December 9, 2013, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 on August 20, 2014. Buffett contributed $2.6 billion to Swiss Re's effort to obtain additional capital in 2009. With the option to purchase more than 20%, Berkshire Hathaway already held a 3% investment in the company. Buffett purchased Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34 billion in cash and equity in 2009 as well. With an average net worth of almost $62 billion, Buffett was listed by Forbes as the richest person in the world in 2008. With a net worth of $37 billion in 2009, Buffett was the second wealthiest person in the United States, behind only Bill Gates, after giving vast sums of money to charity. By September 2013, his net worth has increased to $58.5 billion. Some of the top stocks in the investment portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Our MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the investment portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The stocks that are a new addition to the portfolio in 2022 were selected. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Buffett Stock Portfolio: Warren Buffett's Recent BuysBuffett Stock Portfolio: Warren Buffett's Recent Buys10. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33    Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) engages in investment banking and capital markets, and asset management businesses in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The most recent buy of Berkshire Hathaway is Jefferies Financials which was bought in the third quarter of 2022 with 433,558 shares worth of $12.8 million. On January 9, Jefferies Financial posted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $0.57, beating the analyst’s estimate of $0.52. The revenue over the period was $1.44B beating the analyst’s estimate of $1.25B, revenue was down 18% compared to the revenue over the same period last year.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $495.4 million in Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF), compared to 29 in the preceding quarter worth $425.5 million.Just like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Jefferies Financial Group (NYSE: JEF) is one of the top stocks that elite investors are interested in as the market recovers from a macro slowdown. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Goodhaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry-wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”9. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) manufactures and markets building products primarily for use in new home construction, repair and remodeling, and outdoor structure markets. Berkshire Hathaway bought a stake in Louisiana-Pacific Corporation stock in the third quarter of 2022 with 5.8 million shares worth of $296.7 million. This makes up 0.1% portion of its total investment. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Omaha, Nebraska-based investment firm Berkshire Hathaway is a leading shareholder in Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $296.7 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, L1 Capital International, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We have invested in Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) due to its Smartside siding business. Smartside has consistently increased its share of the siding market in the U.S., not just in new residential construction but repair and renovation sheds and other markets. Louisiana Pacific has not been able to keep up with demand for Smartside and is sold out by the end of 2022. New capacity is being added currently which will support future growth.Between 2015 to 2022, Smartside EBITDA increased from around US$100 million to a run rate approaching US$400 million. We believe Smartside has many years of strong profitable growth to come (see Figure 12).Imagine being offered to buy a business. This business breakeven in a down year making an operating profit of a few hundred million dollars in a normal year, and in an exceptional period in 2021 made around US$1.5 billion profit. The person offers to sell you the business for nothing. This is the current investment opportunity for Louisiana Pacific. In addition to owning Smartside, it also owns the second largest oriented strand board business in North America and a successful woods product business in South America. The price of OSB is exceptionally volatile but has recently delivered super-normal profits to Louisiana Pacific, enabling management to buy back 45% of shares on the issue while maintaining net cash. At Louisiana Pacific’s current share price, we are paying the bottom end of fair value for Smartside and getting the OSB business practically for nothing.”8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures, packages, tests, and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, the United States, and internationally. Berkshire Hathaway bought Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stock in the third quarter of 2022 with 60 million shares worth $4.1 billion. This makes up 1.39 % portion of its total investment. On January 12, Taiwan Semiconductor posted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $1.82, beating the analyst’s estimate of $1.77. The company’s revenue of $19.93B, however, missed analyst’s estimate of $20.92B. Despite this, the revenue saw a YoY increase of 26.6%.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 87 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $13.2 billion in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 72 in the previous quarter worth $9.2 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain the conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”7. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties in the United States, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Berkshire Hathaway bought Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) stock in the first quarter of 2022. The holding stood at 194.4 million shares worth $11.9 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022.

Here is what the fund said:“Our top-performing stocks in the quarter include Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”6. Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40    Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) operates as a media and entertainment company worldwide. Berkshire Hathaway bought Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) stock in the first quarter of 2022. The holding stood at 91.2 million shares worth $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022.

In the last reported quarter, VRTX delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.67%.This large-cap biotech’s performance has been pretty impressive, with its earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters but missing the mark in one. VRTX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.16%, on average.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price-eps-surprise |Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote In the past year, shares of Vertex have risen 24.6% against the industry’s 8.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported.Factors to ConsiderVertex’s revenue growth in fourth-quarter 2022 is likely to have been driven by a rapid uptake of its blockbuster cystic fibrosis (CF) medicine Trikafta/Kaftrio (Trikafta’s brand name in Europe). The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Trikafta sales are pegged at $2.04 billion and $1.99 billion, respectively.Sales for Trikafta in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been driven bystrong uptakes in international markets and increased drug adoption in the United States among pediatric patients (6-11 years of age). Higher sales of Trikafta are likely to have caused sales erosion of Vertex’s other CF drugs and existing combinations, namely Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko/Symkevi.Investors will also expect an update on Vertex’s non-CF pipeline during the fourth-quarter conference call.As part of its collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, Vertex developed exa-cel (formerly CTX001), an investigational ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy for two indications, namely sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).Vertex expects exa-cel to be its next commercial launch.Story continuesDuring fourth-quarter 2022, Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics initiated a rolling biologics license application (BLA) submission with the FDA for exa-cel in both SCD and TDT indications. Both CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex intend to complete this rolling submission in first-quarter 2023.This October, the FDA accepted the company’s investigational new drug (IND) application seeking to initiate a clinical study on a new candidate, VX-634, targeting alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). A clinical study will start later this year.Last December, the FDA also accepted another one of the company’s IND applicationsseeking to start clinical studies on VX-522, an investigational mRNA-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) indication. With this therapy, management intends to target a patient populationwho still cannot benefit from its four marketed CF medicines. The therapy is being developed in collaboration with Moderna. This study is expected to begin in early-2023.Apart from the above therapies, Vertex is rapidly advancing its mid- to late-stage pipeline candidates in additional diseases like acute pain, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD) and cell therapy for type I diabetes. The company signed a collaboration deal with Entrada Therapeutics in December 2022 to discover and develop intracellular Endosomal Escape Vehicle (EEV) therapeutics for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Vertex this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

313,1ec2c15a-a0d2-3120-8a5d-a715e9a03f48,VRTX,2023-02-04,Ultragenyx (RARE) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ultragenyx-rare-expected-beat-earnings-150003063.html,1675350003,STORY,"['RARE', 'VRTX']","[The market expects Ultragenyx (RARE) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.1%.Revenues are expected to be $101.59 million, up 21.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ultragenyx?For Ultragenyx, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ultragenyx will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ultragenyx would post a loss of $2.29 per share when it actually produced a loss of $2.43, delivering a surprise of -6.11%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ultragenyx appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.53 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.29 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Vertex has been revised 5.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 16.68 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 23.22. Over the past year, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.19 and as low as 13.22, with a median of 15.65.Investors should also note that TXT holds a PEG ratio of 1.23. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TXT's industry has an average PEG of 2.05 right now. Over the past 52 weeks, TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.55 and as low as 0.60, with a median of 1.16.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.23. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.61.Story continuesValue investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Textron is likely undervalued currently.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Waste Management (NYSE:WM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Waste Management How Quickly Is Waste Management Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Waste Management grew its EPS by 12% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for Waste Management remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 9.9% to US$20b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Waste Management's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Waste Management Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Waste Management has a market capitalisation of US$62b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$107m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Waste Management but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Waste Management Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Waste Management is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth.

322,97e57dc0-e4f6-3910-8819-ece91cee4643,WM,2023-02-04,The 7 Best ‘Waste’ Stocks for Dumpster-Diving Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-waste-stocks-dumpster-224432364.html,1675205072,STORY,"['WCN', 'CNM', 'WM', 'RSG', 'QRHC', 'CLH']","[Although waste stocks to buy might not represent the first avenue for most investors seeking profits in a possibly resurgent market cycle, it might be among the most logical. With the pace of inflation slowing, consumer spending may rise relative to last year. If so, greater consumption would translate to more waste products, bolstering the dumpster-diving sector.Another factor that could potentially lift waste management stocks centers on the lack of alternatives. Just because you throw your trash products per their appropriate compartments, the act itself doesn’t really mean anything. Companies in this specialty must still pick up your rubbish and dispose of it some way, somehow.Plus, this particular segment of the management industry covers many areas, from residential trash to wastewater services. Fundamentally, it’s a permanently relevant sector – appropriate for both good times and bad. On that note, below are waste management stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMWaste Management$154.73WCNWaste Connections$132.90RSGRepublic Services$124.82CLHClean Harbors$130.30AMBPArmagh Metal Packaging$5.62CNMCore &amp; Main$22.07QRHCQuest Resource$6.90Waste Management (WM)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comObviously, we can’t have a discussion about waste management stocks without mentioning Waste Management (NYSE:WM). As with other publicly traded securities, WM didn’t enjoy the best performance in 2022. Presently, shares gained only a bit more than 1% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, that’s a much better performance than the benchmark S&amp;P 500, which dropped nearly 10% during the same period.Fundamentally, this slow-and-steady approach symbolizes why investors appreciate Waste Management. Whether a bull market, bear market or something in between, people will continue to generate waste products. Someone has to step in and take care of the constant buildup, providing predictability in the company’s revenue channels.Story continuesPresently, Wall Street analysts rate WM as a consensus hold, which doesn’t particularly sound encouraging. However, their average price target of $169.20 implies nearly 11% upside potential. Even better, hedge fund sentiment rates as very positive. Therefore, investors should look into WM as one of the waste management stocks to buy.Waste Connections (WCN)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockProviding garbage pickup and dumpster rental services for businesses in the U.S. and Canada, Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN) should enjoy significant upside if the broader economy normalizes. If not, the company will still command relevance, which makes waste management stocks such an intriguing idea. What’s more, WCN specifically gained over 5% in the trailing year, underscoring its demand predictability.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, WCN rates as significantly undervalued. Objectively, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1%, beating out over 60% of the competition. On the bottom line, Waste Connection’s net margin pings at 11.6%, above 75% of sector players. About the only major weakness is its balance sheet, which overall features middling stability.Nevertheless, perhaps the most important takeaway centers on Wall Street’s assessment. Per covering experts, WCN rates as a consensus (and unanimous) strong buy. Also, their average price target implies potential upside of 15%, making WCN one of the waste management stocks to consider.Republic Services (RSG)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA competitor to Waste Management and Waste Connections in the disposal service segment, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) did take a hit compared to other companies in the field. In the trailing year, RSG slipped 3% of equity value. However, in the past five years, RSG shot up 81.5%, beating out the former two waste management stocks.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, RSG features a modestly undervalued profile. To be fair, sales growth slipped in 2020, impacting the longer-term trajectory. However, in the third quarter of 2022, Republic posted revenue of nearly $3.6 billion, up roughly 23% against the year-ago period. Moreover, the company enjoys solid profit margins. In particular, its net margin of 11.2% beat out over 73% of its rivals.Presently, Wall Street analysts rate RSG as a consensus moderate buy. Conspicuously, their average price target implies upside potential of almost 18%. That’s quite robust for waste management stocks, making it worthy of consideration.Clean Harbors (CLH)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Norwell, Massachusetts, Clean Harbors (NYSE:CLH) provides environmental and industrial services, including hazardous waste disposal for companies. The enterprises Clean Harbors serve include Fortune 500 entities, small waste generators and federal, state, provincial and local governments. If you think it’s a relevant business, you’d be right. In the trailing year, CLH gained a whopping 38%.Better yet, it’s still going strong, moving up 12% in the year so far. Now, because of the enormous price hike, Gurufocus.com rates CLH as fairly valued. Still, it offers some potent stats. For instance, the company’s three-year free-cash-flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 20.8%, exceeding over 67% of industry competitors. Also, its return on equity (ROE) of over 23% reflects an extremely high-quality business enterprise.Currently, Wall Street analysts rate CLH as a consensus strong buy. It would have been unanimous save for one hold rating. Also, their average price target of $140 implies upside potential of 10%. Thus, it still has legs as one of the waste management stocks to buy.Ardagh Metal Packaging (AMBP)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA leading global supplier of sustainable, infinitely recyclable, metal beverage cans to brand owners, Ardagh Metal Packaging (NYSE:AMBP) might not be a household name here in the U.S. However, as global populations rise and broader consumption habits increase, sustainability will become a critical issue. To be sure, investors didn’t see it that way in 2022, with AMBP losing 42% in the trailing year. Still, in the new year, it’s up almost 11%.On the fiscal side, Ardagh carries notable risks. Objectively, the market prices AMBP at nearly 15-times forward earnings. That’s conspicuously higher than the industry median of 12 times. Also, its balance sheet could use some work. Nevertheless, on the optimistic front, Ardagh’s ROE stands at a stratospheric 65%. This indicates superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits.Presently, Wall Street analysts rate AMBP as a consensus moderate buy. Just as importantly, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment for Ardagh pings as very positive. For risk takers, AMBP could be one of the waste management stocks to buy.Core &amp; Main (CNM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBased in Missouri, Core &amp; Main (NYSE:CNM) is a leading specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products, and related services in the U.S. At the moment, the company operates approximately 300 branches nationwide. Despite relevancies as one of the indirect waste management stocks to buy, CNM slipped nearly 10% in the trailing year.However, that doesn’t appear to be the main storyline for Core &amp; Main. In the year so far, CNM gained 11% of equity value. Even better, the company enjoys a series of attractive fiscal attributes. First, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.5%, above over 85% of the competition. Second, it’s a profitable enterprise, featuring a net margin of 5.52% (above 65% of rivals).As a bonus, the market prices CNM at a forward multiple of 10. In contrast, the sector median pings at 14.8. Finally, Wall Street analysts rate CNM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target implies upside potential of nearly 29%, making CNM one of the waste management stocks to consider.Quest Resource Holding (QRHC)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhile a relative unknown among waste management stocks, Quest Resource Holding (NASDAQ:QRHC) deserves closer examination. Per its website, Quest Resource manages companies’ operational waste streams by delivering tailored waste solutions that increase efficiencies, maximize landfill diversion, improve their bottom line and help meet business and sustainability goals. In the trailing year, QRHC gained slightly over 5%.Even more impressive, since the January opener, QRHC jumped up 10%. To be sure, prospective investors will require significant belief in the underlying narrative. For instance, the company’s Altman Z-Score sits in the distressed zone. As well, on a trailing-12-month basis, Quest’s net margin is in negative territory.Still, that’s not the whole story. Currently, the market prices QRHC at a forward multiple of 14.14. And it also prices shares at a trailing sales multiple of 0.48. Both stats come in under their respective sector median values. Finally, Wall Street pegs QRHC as a consensus moderate buy. Further, with an average price target of $12.50, the implication is that shares will nearly double from here.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

323,4da599c0-debb-36ac-aa44-d9114cd5abef,SYK,2023-02-04,What Makes Stryker (SYK) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-stryker-syk-buy-stock-170005637.html,1675443605,STORY,['SYK'],"[Investors might want to bet on Stryker (SYK), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Stryker is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Stryker imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for StrykerFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this medical device maker is expected to earn $9.99 per share, which is a change of 7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Stryker. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Stryker to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 25.1% gain over the past four weeks.U.S. Physical Therapy recorded a strong price increase before its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings release with the latest Zacks Consensus Estimate showing significant upward revision for its quarterly revenues compared to the year-ago reported number. The company is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 22.This physician staffing services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.4%.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at 5 Biggest Industrial Software Companies in the World.The industrial software industry is a rapidly growing field, driven by the need to stay ahead of the curve in industrial process optimization. Technology is being used to automate and streamline manufacturing operations, with the ultimate goal of maximizing efficiency and reducing costs. Industrial software products can range from simple data tracking and analysis platforms to complex process control systems that utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence.The industrial software industry is also changing the way companies think about their operations. By leveraging the power of industrial software, companies can create a data-driven culture that is focused on continuous improvement. This shift in mindset can help companies gain a competitive edge by improving their operational efficiency and reducing costs. Today, industrial software is used in a variety of industries, ranging from manufacturing and engineering to power generation and healthcare.An Analysis of the Global Industrial Software Industry: Size, Drivers, Challenges, and Regional InsightsAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global industrial software market was worth $92.58 billion in 2021, and is expected to grow to $157.41 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 9.25% from 2022 through 2027.The industrial software market is experiencing expansion due to the increasing popularity of industrial cloud computing technology. With cloud computing, IT services are accessible via web-based applications instead of connecting to a server directly. Industrial cloud computing allows the transmission of data to the software programs that automate workflows and the applications used on computers or mobile devices. Additionally, the growth of the market is attributed to various factors, such as the rise in spending on software, the development of industry 4.0, the increasing need for operational efficiency, the growing electronics industry, and the digital transformation of businesses.Story continuesMoreover, the industrial software market is expected to grow due to the integration of AI with industrial software, the rising adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and the implementation of digital twins. Businesses use digital twins to reduce equipment failure risk and automate repairs. This leads to scalable, cost-effective, and agile supply chain operations.However, there are some challenges the global industrial software industry is faced with. These include hefty initial investments and cybersecurity. While the integration of cloud, mobile, IoT, and AI streamlines industrial processes, it also creates greater security, compliance, and data protection challenges. IoT and cloud computing help industrial software run smoothly but these technologies also make data more vulnerable to getting hacked.According to the Research and Markets, North America held the largest market share of the industrial software market in 2021 due to increasing adoption of industrial software by SMEs, and the increased investments by vendors in tech-driven software. The Asia Pacific region is expected to expand over the forecasted period due to a booming manufacturing industry and SMEs. Additionally, government support for IT infrastructure in the region is expected to fuel market growth further.The industrial software industry is expected to continue to grow as companies continue to look for ways to improve their operations. As technology advances, the demand for more efficient and effective industrial software solutions will increase. As a result, companies are investing in new software products and solutions to help them meet the growing demand for industrial software.

This takes the annual payment to 3.0% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy Valero Energy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, Valero Energy was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 68.4%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 46%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendValero Energy Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.60 total annually to $3.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 21% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Valero Energy has grown earnings per share at 27% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Valero Energy Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Valero Energy that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Global fuel demand has improved significantly, supported by strong economic growth.The strong oil price scenario is encouraging customers to increase drilling activities, which might raise the company’s oilfield service demand. This is because RPC provides specialized oilfield services and equipment to almost all prospective oil and gas shale plays in the United States.RPC expects its customers to respond to the favorable commodity pricing scenario. Hence, the company anticipates continued drilling and completion activities as it begins the first quarter of 2023. This will translate into higher demand for its oilfield services and secure incremental cash flows. RPC expects to capitalize on the improving oilfield service demand.The company’s balance sheet strength is commendable. With no debt load, RPC had cash and cash equivalents of $126.4 million at the fourth-quarter end. This reflects the company’s strong balance sheet that provides it with massive financial flexibility.RPC is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. The company’s board of directors increased its regular quarterly cash dividend from 2 cents per share to 4 cents per share. It has the financial capabilities to make investments and generate strong cash flows.Thus, RES, one of the leading oilfield service providers, is poised for an upside in the coming days.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

338,428474e1-523e-3b40-9dbe-687af894645f,UNH,2023-02-04,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 89% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-nyse-unh-110018531.html,1675508418,STORY,['UNH'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of UnitedHealth Group. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that UnitedHealth Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at UnitedHealth Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in UnitedHealth Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 7.5% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.5b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over UnitedHealth Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with UnitedHealth Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

Market participants were busy assessing the Fed’s February FOMC outcome and the possibility of a near-term recession. Gradual reduction of the magnitude of interest rate hike boosted investors sentiment. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite ended sharply higher while the Dow finished in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.1% to close at 34,053.93. Notably, 15 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory while 15 in negative zone. The major loser of the blue-chip index was UnitedHealth Group Inc.

The tech-laden index recorder highest closing since Sep.12, 2022.The S&amp;P 500 surged 1.5% to end at 4,179.76. The broad-market index recorder highest closing since Aug 25, 2022. Seven out of 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in positive territory while four in red.The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and the real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) were up 3.1%, 2.7%, 6.6% and 2.3%, respectively. On the other hand, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) was down 2.3%.The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 4.8% to 18.73. A total of 15 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 11.70 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.55-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeIn its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Story continuesPowell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. “Inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases,” Powell said in post-FOMC news conference. “And while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path.”However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and a lighter monetary control will be good for growth sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary.Major Central Banks Hike RateOn Feb 2, the European Central Bank (ECB) hiked the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and said that it would raise interest rate by another 0.5% in March. The central  bank will keep raising the benchmark rate until inflation rate come down to 2% target level.The Bank of England also raised the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and indicated that it will continue monetary tightening in order to combat inflationary pressure.Economic DataThe Department of Labor reported that unit cost in fourth-quarter 2022 came in at 1.1%, below the consensus estimate of 1.5%.

It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.Fabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Turning to results. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, organic sales fell 11% and which was within our outlook despite the incremental pressure of COVID-19 resurgence in China. Many developed and emerging markets globally outperformed our expectations to offset the COVID-related impacts of significantly reduced retail traffic as well as limited staffing in beauty adviser, in domestic China and Travel Retail in Hainan in November and December. Adjusted EPS fell 45%. While its deep decline, this was meaningfully better than our outlook, driven by both disciplined expense management and moderation of the stronger U.S. dollars. Importantly, we continue to prudently invest for growth, launching thought after innovation and increasing A&amp;P as a percentage of sales.Story continuesFor fiscal year 2023, we are lowering our outlook for organic sales growth and adjusted diluted EPS primarily for 2 reasons. First, inventory levels in Hainan remains somewhat more elevated than we expected due to the disruptions in travel and in-store staffing levels in November and December. Second, the recently announced potential rollback of COVID related supportive measures in Korea Duty Free are creating a near-term transitory pressure to our business with our courier duty-free retailers. In the third quarter, it is more than offsetting the initial positive impact from the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumers as well as favorable trends in our second quarter, including outstanding performance across many developed markets in Western Europe and Asia Pacific as well as many emerging markets globally and a better-than-expected currency environment.All told, our return to growth has shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which Tracey will discuss in greater detail. We remain focused on investing in our brands including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to fuel our multiple engines of growth strategy. Our growth engines in the second quarter were many among categories, regions and channels, and we anticipate the gradual return of more growth engines across the second half of fiscal year 2023. Beginning with categories. Fragrance extended its long-running double-digit organic sales growth streak in the second quarter, rising 12%. We are inspired by the growth prospects still ahead for the luxury and artisanal segment of the category.As consumer unique distinct and long lasting sense of the highest quality. Many of today, consumers seek to build an occasion-based collection to express on sell differently across seasons, time of the day or events. Our portfolios of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS, Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle is ideally positioned for this accelerating fundamental shift. As demand increases globally, we are excited about our plans to bring these brands to new markets and channels in the coming quarters. Innovation will also continue to be a key growth pillar. For example, Tom Ford Beauty outstanding loans or in the first half will be followed by the cherry collection in the second half, building on the success of regional hero last cherry.Makeup grew organically in the Americas as well as the domestic markets EMEA in across southeast Asia in the second quarter. Our brands are indeed realized in the promise of the category as professional and personal use education feed on point innovation, alluring marketing campaigns on new platforms and I think artist. MAC was a standout success. The brand growth engines were many, freestanding doors excelled, welcoming consumers with expert services delivering double-digit organic sales growth globally. Across channels, blockbuster innovation, hero products and holiday merchandise proved highly sort. Clinic further fueled makeup across subcategories led by list as the brand has created a hero franchise with almost lipstick in black honey.Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation had exceptional success with Its My Shade, My Story campaign in Western Europe. Virality on TikTok drove strong new consumer acquisition and the franchise strengthened its #1 ranking foundation with prestige beauty share gains. Looking ahead, we are excited for the launch of Estee Lauder Pure Color lipstick in the second half. The brand reinvented its iconic franchise to capitalize on lipstick revival and integrate skin care benefits for lips. -- designed to flatter all skin tones across mat, cream and luster finishes the line packaging peso edge to the brand original lipstick from the 1960s. In hair care, our brands extended the category organic sales growth streak to 8 consecutive quarters. for the second half, did launch last July in Mainland China will be complemented by the brand recent entry into Travel Retail in Haina.-- as we continue investing for the vibrant growth opportunity of prestige hair care with the Chinese consumers. Moreover, Avida became a certified B Corporation, joining Le Labo in our portfolio in achieving these important third-party validation as the brand deepened its decades-long commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Skin Care organic sales fell sharply in the second quarter. There were a few headwinds with the biggest challenge being COVID-19 in travel retail in Asia and with the Chinese consumer, given the category's exposure. Amin, the top landscape for skin care, the ordinary was a striking success. Its organic sales growth accelerated from high single digit in the first quarter to strong double digits in the second quarter.The brand's hero product excelled as did the blockbuster innovation of multiple tail lash and brow serum, while the ordinary also realized outstanding performance in the specialty multichannel again, momentum for its exciting launch in India in the fourth quarter of last year. We are focused on returning skin care to growth globally with sequentially improving trends from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a transitory pressure from travel retail abate. To that end, we have an incredibly rich innovation pipeline primed to launch. Here a few among them. Already out from MAC is its new hyper-real franchise as the brand leverage its expertise to create an artist approved skin care line of products which are purposely designed to perform also with makeup.La Air revamped motorizing soft cream arrived this month with powerful new clinical results to reverse and receive visible signs of aging. Thereafter, Clinique will bring most Sud SPS to market. extend its popular hero product to meet consumer desire for hydration and some protection with a lightweight texture that has made MotorSerge100 age and Icon. With these launches, we aim to reach new consumers demographic tapped into high-growth subsegment. Let me now turn to geographies. While the U.S. and domestic China were challenged in the second quarter with sales falling single digit organically in each market, we believe both will be growth engines in the second half. For the U.S., we are optimistic for a return to growth given sequentially improving monthly trend in each of organic sales and retail sales performance throughout the second quarter.Building on this momentum, the market is equipped with numerous growth drivers, including an exceptional innovation pipeline across brands roll out of new Clinique counters to select doors after a successful pilot of Clinique lab in and launch of exclusive products by many brands in specialty-multi. We are also progressively modernizing numerous freestanding store as they are primed to be an important contributor to growth following rationalization of the footprint. Moreover, our enhanced omnichannel capabilities are also primed to contribute to growth in the U.S. as consumers who engage with our brands online and in store drive consistently higher value from upsell and cross-sell. This was especially true during holidays in the second quarter.For domestic China, we are confident in a vibrant recovery for our business following the relaxing of cove restriction. -- as the economy is well positioned to rebound and Chinese consumers are passion for prestige beauty. We entered this phase with momentum having expanded our market share of prestige but in China during the second quarter, driven by gains on all of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care demonstrating that this ability of our aspirational brand portfolio and the excellent go-to-market strategies of our local team. While the third quarter is set to be more variable, because of the high level of covet cases, we now anticipate even stronger organic sales growth as of the fourth quarter as recovery evolves. We expect online to continue its strengths and anticipate a gradual return to more fulsome brick-and-mortar traffic by the end of the fiscal year.Online organic sales rose single digit in the second quarter, fueled by many brands led by La Mer double-digit growth. We achieved excellent results for 11 as the Estee Lauder brand realized top ranks across platforms. Moreover, our retail sales growth in online channel meaningfully outpaced the industry in the quarter for strong prestige beauty share gains. Beyond the U.S. and China, we realized outstanding organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Our local team has been executing with excellence to deliver broad-based sales gains. Western Europe, led by the U.K. prospered, while Japan and Australia contributed strongly in Asia Pacific. India, Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia are among the stars of our emerging markets with each posting strong double-digit organic sales growth led by India, rising nearly 50%.We are very encouraged with the excellent performance we are delivering in emerging markets. As these emerging markets evolve in recovery from the pandemic, we foresee compelling long-term growth opportunity arising from the expanding middle class trading up into prestige beauty. We entered this important phase of recovery from a position of strength as we hold leading prestige beauty share in many of these markets. For example, in India, Mexico, South Africa, we are the #1 rent company in both prestige makeup and skincare, while we lead in prestige makeup in Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey. Let me now turn to the strategic deal we announced in November to acquire Tom 4. This transformational luxury acquisition will make Tumor an own brand of stellate companies.enabling us to manage the brand's intellectual property and equity. Staying true to our focus as a pure play in prestige beauty. We have also reached agreements with luxury companies, ZenyaGroup and Marcolin to license the brand fashion and eyewear businesses, respectively. We first partnered with Tom Ford over 15 years ago, and a singular vision of model luxury is beyond compare. Together, we have elevated to for beauty into the top echelon of high-growth luxury beauty impressively. TolfBeauty is expected to achieve $1 billion in net sales annually over the next couple of years, and we are promising profitable growth opportunities ahead. Before I close, I want to recognize the start of black Easter month in the U.S. and thank our employees to have created an engaging calendar of events for colleagues and consumers to celebrate and honor the black experience.while we continue to focus on accelerating our commitment to raise our equity and the collective accomplishment of our equity goals year-round. In closing, while we are lowering our fiscal year 2023 outlook to reflect the additional transitory pressures affecting our Travel Retail business, -- we are encouraged by both the strong underlying trends in many other areas of our business and improving macro trends. Inflation has stabilized in many markets globally the strength of the U.S. dollar has moderated. And the return to mobility domestically and international travel is happening earlier than expected. Moreover, in the first half of fiscal year 2023, we made exciting progress on several strategic initiatives to drive growth and resiliency in our business.Cosmetics, Health, CarePhoto by Tanya Shulga🇺🇦 on UnsplashWe significantly strengthened our capabilities in innovation, manufacturing and distribution have opened the China innovation labs our first plant in Asia Pacific, our new DC in China, while we also announced our brand portfolio with Tom Ford and Balmain Beauty. All told, we have great confidence that we will emerge from this volatile transitional year, even better positioned to realize the long-term growth opportunity of global prestige beauty to our employees, our future is bright because of your creativity, passion and wisdom. I extend my deepest gratitude for your significant contribution to our long-term success. And now I turn the call over to Tracey.Tracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. As Fabrizio mentioned, our business in the second quarter continued to be pressured by the external headwinds of COVID-related impacts, including the rising number of COVID cases in China, lower shipments of replenishment orders in the U.S. and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our second quarter organic net sales declined 11% and earnings per share decreased 49% to $1.54. We tighter expense management and a slightly improved currency impact contributed to our better-than-expected EPS results. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%. The -- we saw healthy demand for our holiday offerings as consumers gravitated to our in-store and online promotions.However, we also experienced lower shipments of replenishment orders due to both retailer inventory tightening as we anticipated, and a later improvement in retail trends post-Christmas. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly all markets, the evolution of recovery and makeup as consumers return to stores, and the strength of our fragrance portfolio. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region declined 17%, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of 3%. The decline was driven by travel retail as expected, while growth from nearly every market in the rest of the region was strong. Our global travel retail sales were significantly pressured by the ongoing COVID-related impacts.Despite stores being opened throughout the quarter, travel to Hainan remain largely curtailed, and as a result, shipments of replenishment inventory remained low. Elsewhere, we experienced strong sales growth in Travel Retail, reflecting increased international tourism as travel restrictions in many countries lifted from the prior year. The ongoing pressures in Asia travel retail more than offset the growth we experienced in the rest of the EMEA region, including both developed and emerging markets such as the United Kingdom, France, India and Turkey. We continue to see various stages of recovery across the region that coupled with the strong resumption of tourism fueled brick-and-mortar growth during the quarter. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region fell 7%, primarily due to the ongoing COVID-related impacts in Greater China.This affected brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and Dr. Jart Travel Retail in Korea. Online sales continued to grow in Mainland China due in part to the expansion of our online presence with the recent launches on JD and Joyn as well as solid performance during the 11.11 Shopping Festival. Most of the other markets in the region continued to progress in recovery as the return of brick-and-mortar traffic led to high single-digit or double-digit growth in Japan, Australia, Malaysia and the Philippines. From a category standpoint, fragrance continued to lead growth with organic net sales rising 12%. Strong holiday demand for our beautiful line of fragrances from Estee Lauder and double-digit growth from both La La bond Tom Ford Beauty propelled the category's growth in every region during the quarter.Organic net sales in hair care rose 4% and declined 3% in makeup, the latter driven primarily by the COVID restrictions in China as solid performance from both MAC and Clinique drove growth in both the Americas and in domestic markets in EMEA. Organic net sales in skin care declined 20%. This category continues to be the most affected by the COVID restrictions in China, particularly in Asia travel retail and Mainland China, where skin care accounts for a large majority of our business. Our gross margin declined 430 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing in this quarter were more than offset by inflationary pressures in our supply chain, region and category mix, and higher costs due to promotional items.Operating expenses increased 500 basis points as a percent of sales, driven primarily by the reduction in sales. This also reflects our investments in areas such as advertising, promotional activities and innovation, which increased 150 basis points compared to last year. Operating income declined 46% to $768 million, and our operating margin contracted 930 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded $207 million of impairment charges related to the 3 brands, primarily reflecting lower-than-expected growth in key geographic regions and channels given the pressure on consumer demand from the impacts of COVID. Diluted EPS of $1.54 decreased 49% compared to last year. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted diluted EPS and by 5% and 4%, respectively.During the quarter, we generated $751 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.8 billion last year. The decline from last year reflects lower net income and the negative impact from changes in working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments. We invested $419 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $708 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we expected, our first half performance was pressured by ongoing external headwinds. Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. For the second half of fiscal 2023, we are encouraged by the easing of COVID restrictions in China and the expected return of travelers throughout Asia and around the world once more stabilization occurs with outbound flights and visas as well as cover entry and testing requirements.In Hainan, we are starting to see increased positive signs already. as traffic level declines have moderated in recent months. However, retailer inventory levels are still somewhat elevated, reflecting the impact of the lengthy store closures as well as the rapid reduction in traffic and in-store staffing levels in November and December. And in Korea travel retail, an incremental headwind has emerged since the last outlook we provided in November. The recently announced potential rollback of COVID-related supportive measures in Korea Duty Free is creating a near-term transitory pressure to our business with our Korean duty-free retailers, which is pressuring our third quarter outlook. We now also expect more moderate net sales growth near term in our China business as the rise of Cove cases in November and December slowed expected brick-and-mortar retail traffic and social usage occasions.-- which continued in January during the pre-Lunar New Year shopping time frame. Collectively, we expect these impacts to create greater headwinds in the third quarter than we originally anticipated. As a result, we are updating our outlook to reflect a shift in the start of the travel retail recovery in Asia from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 due to the normalization of inventory levels in Hainan, the uncertain pace of recovery of travel retail traffic in Korea and a more moderate acceleration of growth in China. The momentum from our other developed and emerging markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific in the first half is expected to continue as those markets progressively evolve in recovery. We are also cautiously optimistic and expect our North America net sales performance to improve as our retail growth trend in the region has already increased, particularly in January.-- and we have a supportive innovation pipeline planned for the second half, as Fabrizio mentioned. As it relates to our operating income, while these external headwinds have introduced a high level of volatility and that has had a meaningful impact on our financial results this fiscal year. We remain confident in the ongoing strength of prestige beauty, our business strategy and our ability to reaccelerate long-term profitable growth. We, therefore, plan to sustain the strategic investments imperative to that growth, including innovation, advertising and continued geographic expansion for many of our brands. These investments also support the continued strengthening of our multiple engines of growth as we invest in emerging markets and faster growth channels that are already progressing well in their recovery.As a result, we expect to see pressure on our operating income in the third quarter with an accelerated improvement in the fourth quarter as the sales recovery in travel retail, Mainland China, and skin care start to materialize more meaningfully. The negative impacts from foreign currency that we anticipated in our previous guidance have improved due to the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. However, currency is still expected to be a meaningful drag our reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the third quarter and full year. Our outlook is now based on December 30 spot rates of 1.067 for the euro, 1.207 for the pound, 6.964 for the Chinese yuan and 12.63 for the Korean yuan. So with that backdrop, our guidance is as follows: we expect organic sales for our third quarter to decline 10% to 8%, primarily reflecting the pressures to our Travel Retail business that I mentioned previously.Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 3 points and the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations is not expected to be material. The impact of sales from certain designer fragrance license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 to $0.47 for a decline between 81% to 75%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04, such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 79% to 73%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 1 percentage point. For the full year, SP27916451 assuming a reacceleration of Travel Retail in the full range between down 2% to flat.Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 4 percentage points and we expect an additional 1 point of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 15.1%, a 460 basis point contraction from the prior year period primarily due to the geographical and category mix of sales and foreign currency impacts as well as the sustained investments to support recovery as previously mentioned. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting in part the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings.Diluted EPS is expected to range between $4.87 and 502 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.29 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 29% and 27%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations, of approximately 4 percentage points. Regarding the Tom Ford brand acquisition, we expect to complete this transaction in the fourth quarter and to fund it through a combination of cash, debt and deferred payments. In anticipation of closing this transaction, in January, we increased our commercial paper program by $2 billion. We also estimate a slight EPS dilution to the full year outlook that I just provided due to the final purchase accounting inclusive of transaction costs.While this year has undoubtedly been a perfect storm of unforeseen macro pressures on our business, and the transition to accelerated recovery has indeed been longer than we anticipated, we have navigated through the challenging environment and strengthened the company in the process, thanks to our amazing employees, our company values and our multiple engines of growth strategy. We are encouraged by the many signs of improvement in the overall environment and the progress our incredible teams have made in preparing us for a strong recovery. Our fundamentals are solid and intact, reinforced by the actions we have taken over the past few years. From the acquisition of the majority interest in in fiscal 2021 to the recent announcement of our agreement to acquire the Tom Ford brand and the Balmain license agreement.We are expanding our brand portfolio at both the entry and luxury levels of prestige beauty. We've taken strategic actions to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, supply chain agility and local relevance through our new innovation, production and distribution facilities in Asia. We've enhanced our digital marketing capabilities and continue to progress on our ESG initiatives. These actions and many more demonstrate that we remain confident in the long-term sustainable profitable growth of our business. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.See also 12 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy  and 11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

If you want to see more best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.Value stocks are stocks of companies generally considered trading below what many investors think they are worth. Because different investors could view a stock differently, what a stock is worth is subjective. Some investors might view a stock as a value stock while others might find the same stock expensive.To find value stocks, we chose stocks that are included in the The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV).According to the ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) 'seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&amp;P® 500 Value Index (the “Index”).The S&amp;P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value segment in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price ratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.'Value stocks can decline as stocks can always trade for lower than what investors think they are worth. As a ETF, The SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) declined as a whole last year and it could decline this year if economic data doesn't meet estimates.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. When companies have excess capital, many decide to return the excess capital through a stock buyback or by paying a dividend.When profits change, dividends can change. In good times, many companies increase their dividend when their profits increase. In more difficult times, many companies lower their dividends or suspend them altogether.In terms of the economy in 2022 and 2023, the U.S. economy has shown signs of being a little stronger than some expected in terms of Q4 GDP. Inflation has also shown signs of potentially peaking last year.Story continuesIn terms of the effect of increased interest rates on inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on February 1, 2023, ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far.""Nevertheless, Powell also said, ""It would be very premature to declare victory, or to think that we’ve really got this.""If economic data doesn't meet estimates, stocks could always decline, including the best value stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy, we selected value stocks from the 407 holdings of the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® Value ETF (SPYV) as of February 2, 2023.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they paid dividends and that they had considerable earnings growth potential in the next ten years if they maintained their market share.We then sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 920 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3.13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy13.

Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter.

(AAL) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, AAL's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a ""golden cross.""There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.There are three stages to a golden cross. First, there must be a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out. Then, the stock's shorter moving average crosses over its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third stage is when a stock continues the upward momentum to higher prices.This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.Shares of AAL have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 21.9%. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, suggesting that AAL could be poised for a breakout.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account AAL's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter. There have been 5 upwards revisions compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.Moving Average Chart for AALGiven this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on AAL for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Young, Vice President of Investor and Ratings Agency Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.David Young: Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to Aflac Incorporated's fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, we will be hearing remarks about the quarter related to our operations in Japan and the United States from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated. Fred Crawford, President and COO of Aflac Incorporated, who is joining us from Japan, will then touch briefly on conditions in the quarter and discuss key initiatives. Yesterday, after the close, we posted our earnings release and financial supplement to investors.aflac.com, along with a video for Max Broden, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, who provided an update on our quarterly financial results and current capital and liquidity.Max will be joining us for the Q&amp;A segment of the call, along with other members of our executive management; Virgil Miller, President of Aflac U.S,; Brad Dyslin, Global Chief Investment Officer and President of Aflac Global Investments; Al Roziere, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; June Howard, Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Beaver, CFO of Aflac U.S. We are also joined by members of our executive management team at Aflac Life Insurance Japan; Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and CFO; and Koichiro Yoshizumi, Executive Vice President and Director of Sales and Marketing and Alliance Strategy. Before we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws.Story continuesAlthough we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurances that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. And we encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. As I mentioned earlier, the earnings release is available on investors.aflac.com, and includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP U.S. measures. Please also note that after we file our 10-K, we plan to post, on our investor site, a recast quarterly financial supplement, showing the effects of the new long-duration targeted improvement accounting standard had it been applied to the 2022 and 2021 fiscal years.I'll now hand the call over to Dan. Dan?Dan Amos: Thank you, David, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Reflecting on 2022, our management team, employees and sales distribution have continued to be resilient stewards of our business, being there for the policyholders when they need us most, just as we promise. From an overall standpoint, pandemic conditions impacted operations in Japan, especially in the first half of 2022. But they are gradually improving. Meanwhile, pandemic conditions in the U.S. have largely subsided. Turning to our financials, when adjusting for material weakening in the yen, the Company delivered another quarter of solid earnings results that rounded out a year of overall strong performance, as Max addressed in this quarterly video update.For 2022, Aflac Incorporated reported adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of $5.67, which was the Company's second best year in the history following a record 2021. Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results in 2022, with an extremely strong profit margin of 24.9%. One of the consistent key contributors to Aflac Japan's strong financial results is its persistency, which was 94.1% in 2022. As anticipated, our benefit ratio returned to a more normal level in the fourth quarter after seeing a spike due to the practice of deemed hospitalizations, the scope of which was narrowed last September. Throughout the year, we continued to navigate the waves of COVID in Japan. We expected sales would pick up in the second half of the year, especially in the quarter, and that's exactly what we saw happen.Sales in Japan rose 10.8% in the second half of the year, including an 11. 4% increase in the fourth quarter, which led to a full year sales coming in essentially flat. These results reflected the August launch through Associates of Wings, our new cancer insurance products. They also reflected our first sector product updates in the fourth quarter that better positioned Aflac Japan for future long-term sales opportunities. Recently, Prime Minister, Kishida announced that COVID would be downgraded to the same level as seasonal flu starting in mid-May. While we're encouraged by this announcement as a sign of daily life in Japan returning to pre-pandemic conditions, we will see how this evolves, but look to continue building on our sales momentum in 2023.In April, Aflac Japan will begin selling through Japan Post Group, our new cancer insurance product, and subject to FSA approval, for serious diseases, which was developed in collaboration with Japan Post Group. We expect this close collaboration to produce continued gradual improvement of Aflac cancer insurance sales over the intermediate term and to further position the companies for long-term growth. Another element of our growth strategy is our intense focus on being there where consumers want to buy insurance. Our broad network of distribution channels, including agencies, alliance partners and banks continually optimized on opportunities to help provide financial protection to Japanese consumers and we are working hard to support each channel.Turning to the U.S., for 2022, we saw a solid profit margin of 20.4% in the fourth quarter. This result was driven by lower incurred benefits and higher adjusted net income, particularly offset by higher adjusted expenses. I'm pleased with the 17.4% sales increase in the fourth quarter, which reflected the largest amount of quarterly premium in the history of Aflac U.S. and continued to a 16.1% sales increase for the year. This reflects continued improvement in the productivity of our agents and brokers as well as contributions from the build-out of our acquired platforms, namely dental and vision, group life and disability. These are relatively small parts of our sales, but key elements of our growth strategy to sell in our core supplemental health policies.I'm encouraged by the continued improvement in the productivity of our sales associates and brokers. We are seeing success in our efforts to reengage veteran sales associates. And at a time, we're seeing strong growth through brokers. These results reflect continued adaptation to the pandemic conditions, growth in the core products and our investment and build-out of growth initiatives. I believe that the need for the products we offer is strong or stronger than ever before in both Japan and the United States. At the same time, we know consumers' habits and buying preferences have been evolving. We also know that our products are sold, not bought. As we communicate the value of our products, we know that a strong brand alone is not enough. We must paint a better picture of how our products help.In the latest commercial featuring the Aflac Duck and the Gap Goat, the goat personifies the gap that people face when they get medical treatment. Fortunately, the Aflac Duck is the hero who helps overcome the problem. I know this helps demonstrate the need for our products, thus helping our sales opportunities. We continue to work toward reinforcing our leading position and building on the momentum into 2023. Related to capital deployment, we placed significant importance on achieving strong capital ratios in the United States and Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders. In addition, we have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend cash flows and deployable capital against the weakening yen. We pursue value creation through our balanced actions, including growth investments, stable dividend growth and disciplined tactical stock repurchase.With the fourth quarter's declaration, 2022 marks the 40th consecutive year of dividend increases. We treasure our track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. Additionally, the board reiterated its first quarter dividend increase of 5%. Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we have remained tactical in our approach to share repurchase, deploying $2.4 billion in capital to repurchase 39.2 million shares in 2022. Combined with dividends, this means we delivered $3.4 billion back to the shareholders in 2022. Keep in mind, in addition, we have among the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry.We have also focused on integrating the growth investments we made in our platform. We also believe in the underlying strengths of our business and our potential for continued growth in Japan and the United States, two of the largest life insurance markets in the world. We are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. I'm proud of what we've accomplished in terms of both our social purpose and financial results, which have ultimately translated into strong long-term shareholder return. Before I turn it over to Fred, you may recall that the financial analyst briefing in November that I mentioned how Fred would be increasing his focus on Japan and spending more time over there to delve deeper into learning about the operations there.As David mentioned, he is joining us today from Japan where he's on assignment for the better part of 2023. As President and Chief Operating Officer, he is also continuing to focus on Aflac U.S. as well. I'll now turn it over to Fred. Fred?Paper, Document, SignaturePhoto by Leon Seibert on UnsplashFred Crawford: Thank you, Dan. I'm joined here in Tokyo by our Aflac Japan leadership team led by Masatoshi Koide, President of Aflac Japan. Let me begin by saying 2022 was an important year of operational and strategic progress across the organization. Our U.S. growth platforms, dental and vision, group life and disability and consumer markets have moved from integration to full production, with comprehensive product portfolios that are broadly filed and marketed across the U.S. under the Aflac brand. These businesses have modernized operating platforms built to support the scale we anticipate in the future and are now fully contributing to sales and earned premium growth. In Japan, our refreshed cancer product is now further enhanced with the launch of our new consulting support model after nearly a year of successful testing.We launched a revised and tactical approach to the sale of our WAYS and child endowment products, leveraging the strengthened product appeal to promote third sector cross-sell. While navigating difficult COVID conditions, we were proactive in addressing our expense structure, defending strong margins in the face of revenue pressure. From a corporate perspective, we remain focused on risk management and capital efficiency. Two areas of focus included our approach to hedging the U. S. dollar portfolio in Japan and efforts to improve enterprise return on equity and Japan product competitiveness with the launch of Aflac Re, our Bermuda-based reinsurer. Finally, across the organization, we launched a coordinated effort to address the balancing act of investing in and delivering on growth, reducing expenses simplifying our business model and improving overall customer experience.This includes comprehensive project governance, a network of agile teams and regular reporting up to the Board level. The financial goal is simple: to deliver on the outlook provided at this year's investor conference with respect to growth and margins in the U. S. and Japan. We're proud of our efforts, but it's clear from our results that we have worked to do in a few key areas. This includes addressing weak premium persistency in the U.S. and revitalizing our production platform in Japan. Furthermore, we need to address these issues while continuing to advance our technology and associated process improvement across the organization. With that quick review, let's turn to current conditions and what we're focused on in 2023, starting with Aflac Japan.As Dan noted, claims recovered in the fourth quarter, as did the benefit ratio, on January 20th, Prime Minister Kishida announced plans to downgrade under the law COVID-19 to the same level of seasonal influenza, which will be enacted in mid-May. Importantly, this removes the immediate option to implement quarantine and other restrictive measures, such as state of emergency orders. We believe this move is designed to signal and encourage a return to normal, including business activity. While claims processing volumes remain high, this is driven by a natural lag in reporting of claims generated during Japan's seventh wave of COVID under the old deemed hospitalization rules. You can think of this as working the IBNR claims that were financially recognized in the third quarter.Despite continued waves of COVID, we expect our team in Japan to improve on the performance in 2022 as COVID, like the common flu, appears destined to become a way of life in Japan and elsewhere. In that regard, we're focused on the following: First, in terms of distribution recovery and productivity across our channels, our powerful associates channel requires aggressive approach to training and development to drive new customers. Separately, we are working with Japan Post on a campaign surrounding the introduction of the new cancer product in the second quarter. As Dan noted, we have strong commitment at the top of Japan Post, and we are cooperating at levels throughout the organization. It should be noted late this January we also introduced the new cancer product in our Dai-Ichi alliance as well as the financial institutions channel, both of which have performed below our expectations in recent periods.Turning to core product refreshment, our new cancer product will add a critical illness lump sum benefit rider in April, available on old and new cancer products and through Japan Post Group and our associates channels. Cancer ecosystem development is moving from launch to expansion. When analyzing current call volume, over 50% of the calls that are coming into our consulted related service platform relate to treatment, thus suggesting a value proposition beyond the pure financial benefit of paying a claim. Our 2022 refreshed approach to first sector savings is yielding expected results, with approximately 80% of all sales representing customers who are under the age of 49 and approximately 50% of all new first sector customers purchasing a third sector product which is twice our target of 25% cross-sell.Finally, in the face of increased competition and focus on selling the new cancer product, we have seen our medical sales decline and have plans to refresh our product in the fourth quarter. When stepping back to consider these activities, we are and have been taking broad action across product and distribution with an eye towards returning to an Â¥80 billion production platform in the 2025 and 2026 period. The path to that level of production will build over time. But as we look towards 2023, we expect the continuation of our experience in the second half of 2022, where we generated consistent growth in production. Meeting our long-term targets will require strong execution on all fronts, as well as supportive market conditions and the cooperation of third-party alliances and partners to aid in driving productivity improvement.Finally, while we have made progress, we seek further advancement in digitizing paper and manual processes for greater operating efficiency. This is not entirely an Aflac Japan issue. It's a Japan financial service industry issue. In recent years, we have moved from 30% to approximately 50% of our applications submitted in digital form, with only 10% of claims processed digitally. Over time, we seek to drive digital applications to 80% and digital claims processed to over 40%. This will allow us to take additional cost out of our operations, but requires the commitment of our distribution partners, their agents and customers to drive adoption. I'm here in Japan in part, recognizing this is an important time for Aflac Japan. We are engaged in transformative activities that have long-term franchise implications as we seek to leverage our financial strength and leading third sector position.My focus will be partnering with our leadership team in revitalizing our distribution, incubating new product end markets and digital adoption to drive down expenses and improve customer experience. Turning to the U.S., as Dan noted in his comments, we continue to deliver a balanced attack to the marketplace. Split by product class, group benefits were up 28%, individual benefits up 8%. Split by channel, agent sales were up 7% and broker up 25%. With respect to our expansion businesses, network dental and vision and premier life and disability sales were up 98% and 75%, respectively, for the full year. The underlying signs of momentum are encouraging. For example, in our agent small business franchise, average weekly producers are up 3%, the second consecutive year of growth after a period of steady decline.Dental and vision is proving out our thesis of cross-sell as roughly $0.80 of supplemental health and life products are sold with every dollar of dental and vision. Our life and disability platform, not only has strong sales, but a successful renewal year, and recorded 97% premium persistency. Now fully integrated and expanding, we see 2023 as a year of leveraging this platform to both defend and grow voluntary group business. While it was a difficult year industry-wide for direct-to-consumer sales, we are encouraged by consumer markets 5% increase in sales in the fourth quarter with new alliances coming online. Finally, it was a challenging year for persistency in the U.S. Persistency has stabilized in our individual business. However, weakness earlier in the year continues to impact our trailing 12-month metric.Group Voluntary, a smaller contributor to earned premium, drove most of the 260-basis-point decline in overall persistency. Account persistency across the organization has remained relatively flat, but we lost a few very large accounts during the year. The industry has experienced weakness in voluntary persistency, which tells us there are also labor force dynamics contributing. We have stepped up our focus on persistency, establishing a dedicated office to drive and oversee a series of efforts, including product development, client service, technology solutions and incentive designs. Turning to investment results, investment income in the quarter was stable, with strength from higher yields on floating rate portfolios offset by increased hedge costs and anticipated weakness in alternative investment income.As expected and discussed last quarter, our alternative investment portfolio remained under pressure, posting a loss of $21 million in the quarter. By comparison, last year's quarter enjoyed $127 million in gains. This decline was anticipated given the natural correlation to the public equity markets and the lag in private equity reporting. Despite losses in the quarter, year-to-date, the alternative portfolio generated $103 million in income following an exceptional 2021. Throughout the year, we have refined our hedging strategy, reducing $2 billion in notional currency forwards in exchange for options that reduced hedge costs while protecting capital against material moves in the yen. Overall, as we look at 2023, we are staying the course with respect to our strategic and tactical asset allocations as we watch closely the risk of economic slowdown driven by Fed action to fight inflation.We are also watching the Bank of Japan as they introduce a new governor this spring which many believe could lead to a change in policy. Before turning the call back to David, it's worth following up on Max's recorded comments to reinforce how we are positioned with respect to potential for a period of U.S. or global weakness. Our morbidity-based insurance model is defensive in nature, with relative stability in sales, earned premium and profit margins through economic cycles. Among traditional life insurance peers, we maintain low asset leverage as defined by the ratio of general account assets to regulatory capital, particularly if you exclude our concentration in JGBs. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to weather the current economic uncertainty, recognizing we would anticipate some pressure on our $12 billion loan portfolios.We work closely with our external managers for middle market and real estate loans and have conducted a comprehensive stress test designed to apply recessionary pressure to these portfolios. Our approach included a moderate and severe recession, applying loss rates consistent with past economic cycles. Both scenarios resulted in elevated, but manageable losses, with no immediate need to change our disciplined approach to these asset classes and putting new money to work. When looking at the impact of core capital ratios, we developed a market pricing, ratings migration and loss scenario that falls in between a mild and severe recession and includes the entirety of our general account assets. When applying these stress tests, our core ratios of RBC, SMR and ESR all came out the other side well above are minimum thresholds.While it is wide to proceed with caution -- wise is to proceed with caution, we do not see recessionary conditions as disruptive to our capital deployment plans. I'll now hand the call back to David for Q&amp;A. David?David Young: Thank you, Fred. Now we are ready to take your questions. But first, let me ask you to please limit yourself to one initial question followed by a related question. And then get back in the queue to allow other participants an opportunity to ask a question.

350,20fb926a-7ffe-39da-bf66-eec06ac3e53a,AFL,2023-02-04,Aflac's (NYSE:AFL) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflacs-nyse-afl-upcoming-dividend-162157205.html,1675441317,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of March to $0.42. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Aflac Aflac's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, Aflac's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 21.3% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 28%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendAflac Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.66 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.68. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.8% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Aflac has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 19% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Aflac's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Aflac Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Aflac is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Aflac (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing.

The company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year increases in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this retail REIT delivered a surprise of 3.25% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, aided by healthy leasing activity.Over the last four quarters, Federal Realty surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average beat being 5.42%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS SurpriseFederal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS SurpriseFederal Realty Investment Trust price-eps-surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail real estate markets remained robust in the fourth quarter, with resilient demand driving the retail availability rate to 4.9% after hitting a high of 6.6% in fourth-quarter 2020.The core retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, gasoline and auto parts, climbed 7.1% from the prior-year period. The non-store retail sales, which include e-commerce, grew 11.3% year over year.The retail asking rent improved 2.5% year over year for the second consecutive quarter to $22.78 per square foot in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by strong demand and limited new supply.Retail space absorption came in at 12.7 million square feet for fourth-quarter 2022, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of positive retail absorption per the CBRE Group report.Federal Realty is anticipated to have benefited from the above-mentioned factors.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been benefiting retail REITs as retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. This is likely to have driven demand for FRT’s properties, which are strategically located in the first-ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, aiding its fourth-quarter cashflows.Also, the high barriers to entry and strong demographics of these markets, and the infill nature of its properties have allowed FRT to maintain high levels of occupancy.FRT’s well-diversified tenant base of retailers is expected to have led to steady rental revenue generation during the fourth quarter. Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, is anticipated to have enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.The company’s top line is expected to have improved amid these tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $276.26 million, implying an 8.7% increase from the figure reported a year ago.The consensus mark for revenues from rental income is pegged at $275.75 million, suggesting an 8.7% rise from the figure reported in the prior-year period. Rental income from minimum rents — commercial — stands at $174.67 million, up from $170.86 million reported in the year-ago period. Rental income from cost reimbursements is projected at $51.48 million, up from $47.69 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Federal Realty’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its acquisition and development activities during the fourth quarter.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share has been revised a penny upward to $1.57 in the past month. Moreover, it implies 6.8% growth year over year.For 2022, Federal Realty projected FFO per share in the range of $6.27-$6.32.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has moved marginally northward to $6.30 over the past month. The figure indicates a 13.1% increase year over year on revenues of $1.07 billion.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for FRT this season.

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +29.75%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $9.68.While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.Here is how Regeneron performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Revenue- Eylea (Aflibercept) - US: $1.50 billion versus the five-analyst average estimate of $1.69 billion.

The year-ago quarter recorded earnings per share of $23.42 due to higher sales.Total revenues in the reported quarter were down 31% year over year to $3.4 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.2 billion. Excluding REGEN-COV (a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab) for COVID-19, sales increased 14%.In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV, as data indicated that these treatments were not active against the Omicron variant.

Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY. Sales were negatively impacted by a short-term shift to off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab), a temporary closing in the fourth quarter of 2022 of a not-for-profit fund that provides patient co-pay assistance and an increase in sales-related deductions.Eylea sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.7 billion.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States.

Sanofi’s collaboration revenues increased 61% to $836 million, driven by profits associated with higher Dupixent sales. We note that Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent and Kevzara, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of both drugs. Bayer’s collaboration revenues were $355 million, down from $372 million.

Price and Consensus Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and ConsensusRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuotePipeline and Regulatory UpdateThe primary endpoints were achieved in two trials investigating aflibercept 8 mg with 12 and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The PHOTON trial in DME and the PULSAR trial in wet AMD both demonstrated that aflibercept 8 mg 12- and 16-week dosing regimens achieved non-inferiority in vision gains compared to the Eylea 8-week dosing regimen.A biologics license application (BLA) for the treatment of wet AMD and DME was submitted to the FDA in December 2022. Regeneron is utilizing a priority review voucher in connection with the submission.In December 2022, the European Commission (EC) approved Eylea for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. The FDA is currently reviewing the supplemental BLA (sBLA) for Eylea to treat ROP in preterm infants, with a target action date of Feb 11, 2023.In December 2022, the EC approved Dupixent for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.In November 2022, the FDA approved the label expansion of Libatayo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC.Our TakeRegeneron’s fourth-quarter results beat estimates. But the disruption in Eylea sales is concerning. The company should benefit from Dupixent’s continued label expansions and solid demand. A potential approval of aflibercept 8 mg will be a great boost to the company. The company’s progress with the oncology portfolio is also impressive.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS.Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.Story continuesJim Davis: Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Quest had a strong year in 2022 with base business revenues growing more than 6% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. As we expected COVID-19 testing revenues declined but still exceeded $1.4 billion in 2022. Our strong performance over the last several years would not have been possible without the commitment and compassion of our nearly 50,000 colleagues who rose to the challenge of COVID-19 while growing our base business. I am incredibly proud of how this team has worked together during an unprecedented period in the lab industry to deliver insights to help create a healthier world. This morning, I'll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our 2023 guidance.In the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.3 billion, earnings per share were $0.87 on a reported basis and $1.98 on an adjusted basis, cash from operations was $334 million. For the full year 2022, total revenues were $9.9 billion, including more than $8.4 billion in base business revenue. Earnings per share were $7.97 on a reported basis and $9.95 on an adjusted basis. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. As you saw this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 8% to $0.71 per share and increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Before discussing additional highlights for 2022, I'd like to share some recent positive regulatory updates. First, Congress delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2023, which would have impacted our revenue between approximately $80 million and $85 million.While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA. Second, CMS increased Medicare reimbursement for specimen collection fees for the first time in nearly 40 years. This could provide Quest with a benefit of approximately $35 million to $40 million this year. Regarding COVID-19 testing revenues, while we did see a steady ramp upward in COVID-19 volumes throughout Q4, our volumes have steadily declined since late December. We expect our COVID-19 revenues to be significantly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. We have lowered our prior COVID-19 volume expectations in 2023 from 10,000 to 15,000 molecular tests per day to 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day. In addition, we continue to negotiate coverage and reimbursement policies with commercial payors following the end of the PHE in May.I will now share some recent highlights in how we are growing this business. In the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Suma Health, a large integrated health system serving communities in northeastern Ohio. We also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of Northern Light Health's outreach laboratory services business located in Maine. We will also provide professional laboratory management services for nine of Northern Light's hospital laboratories along with its cancer center lab. Our M&amp;A pipeline is strong, including potential deals with health systems, small regional labs, and other capability-building assets. In particular, the funnel of opportunities with health systems, which are facing major margin pressures due to labor challenges and mix shift from inpatient to outpatient care, is very active.Quest can help through lab management, population health analytics, mobile services, and/or by monetizing their outreach business. In health plans, we continue to gain traction with value-based contracts where we see meaningfully higher growth than with traditional contracts. Also, we've started to benefit from incentives related to these value-based contracts which helps demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships. With CMS' recent increase in Medicare reimbursement for specimen collections, we've begun discussions with our health plan customers about getting paid appropriately for the phlebotomy services we provide to their members. Higher specimen collection fees enable us to make continuous investment in patient services so their members continue to have the broadest access to high quality and low cost lab testing.In advanced diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services in 2022. In 2022, we also launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test. This 523 gene test relies upon the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 assay to help oncologists with therapy selection by providing comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient's tumor. This test extends our capabilities beyond tissue pathology to offer faster turnaround time from cancer diagnosis to therapy selection. Throughout 2022, we continued to make investments to strengthen our bio-informatics capabilities which support some of the faster growing opportunities of our portfolio, like genomic sequencing services, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, and pharma services.We also invested in our women's health sales force which will position us well for continued strong growth in prenatal genetics. We continue to make progress executing our consumer initiated testing strategy. Last year, we recorded approximately $96 million of both base and COVID-19 consumer testing. In the fall of 2022, we launched our new digital platform, QuestHealth.com. Consumers have found this to be a simpler, more intuitive way to order lab tests. Following the launch of our new consumer sight, we began ramping up marketing spend through the fourth quarter. We saw some of the strongest order volumes to date following some Cyber Monday promotional advertising, and we are encouraged by the acceleration of growth in base testing in December.Shifting to operational excellence, in 2022 we approached our goal of 3% productivity improvements and savings through our Invigorate program. Those savings and productivity improvements did not completely offset the inflationary pressures in our business, as well as the impact of a modest unit price decline. Following the pandemic, we like many companies have faced significant inflation and wage pressures. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business. We continue to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. Last year, we began a new automation conversion project in our Lenexa laboratory. This new project builds on what work we've done in our Marlborough and Clifton labs.We've introduced a new microbiology platform that is highly automated and makes use of artificial intelligence to assist with sample analysis. Finally, we've begun to realize savings from the urinalysis platform conversion that we announced early last year. Filling and retaining our frontline positions continues to be a key priority for us. Although we have experienced higher than average turnover in some of our job categories, we have taken actions to stabilize our workforce and improve frontline employee engagement and retention. We expect these actions to help enhance our productivity in 2023. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&amp;A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions.With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2023 guidance. Sam?SoftwareSam Samad: Thanks Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to $2.15 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 75% to $184 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 15.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 11.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with acquisitions contributing 20 basis points to total volume. For the quarter, total base testing volumes declined 0.6% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower employer drug testing volume and adverse weather events during the quarter, which together represented a volume headwind of more than 1.5%.COVID-19 testing volumes contributed to the decline during the fourth quarter. We resulted approximately 1.9 molecular tests in the quarter. This was down 1.2 million tests versus the third quarter and down approximately 5.4 million tests versus Q4 of 2021. After rising modestly throughout the fourth quarter, our COVID-19 molecular volumes declined to an average of roughly 17,000 tests per day in January and currently make up less than 3% of our daily volumes. In the fourth quarter, revenue per requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 6.8%. This strong increase in revenue per req was driven by a number of factors, including test and payor mix, the more favorable pricing environment with health plans, including incentives under our value-based contracts, and lower patient concessions.Unit price reimbursement pressure remained consistent with our expectations at approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $135 million or 5.8% of revenues compared to $536 million or 19.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $330 million or 14.2% of revenues compared to $579 million or 21.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues and to a lesser extent the negative impact of adverse weather on our volume, as well as higher investments to accelerate growth in our base business. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we experienced a significant increase in employee healthcare costs.Reported EPS was $0.87 in the fourth quarter compared to $3.12 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.98 compared to $3.33 last year. Cash from operations was $1.72 billion for full year 2022 versus $2.23 billion in the prior year period. Turning to our full year 2023 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $8.83 billion and $9.03 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.65 billion and $8.75 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $175 million and $275 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.61 to $8.21, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.40 to $9. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.For our 2023 guidance, please consider the following. As Jim highlighted, we are now assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day for the full year. We expect volumes to continue to decline through the spring and summer but could see a modest uptick during respiratory season in Q4. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to continue near recent levels through the end of the PHE. CMS has indicated that reimbursements will be $51 when the PHE expires in May. We continue to negotiate with health plans regarding coverage policies and reimbursements for COVID-19 testing post-PHE. Note that our COVID-19 testing revenue guidance for 2023 is approximately $150 million lower than the expectations we had back in October.With COVID-19 testing becoming a significantly smaller portion of our overall business, we expect an earnings cadence that is more in line with pre-pandemic seasonality this year, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year at roughly 22% to 23% of full year earnings. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&amp;A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. The benefit of these actions will be modest in Q1 and will expand in the second quarter. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.Jim Davis: Thanks Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong growth of 5% in our base business in 2022. COVID testing revenues as expected declined last year and will represent a significantly smaller portion of our business going forward. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy during our upcoming investor day on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange. Look for an announcement soon with more details on this event. Now we'd be happy to take your questions.

(NYSE:AMP) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-ameriprise-financial-122216885.html,1675513336,STORY,['AMP'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Ameriprise Financial's shares before the 9th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of February.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Ameriprise Financial has a trailing yield of approximately 1.4% on its current stock price of $354.1. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Ameriprise Financial paid out just 19% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Ameriprise Financial has grown its earnings rapidly, up 27% a year for the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Ameriprise Financial has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpIs Ameriprise Financial an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Ameriprise Financial more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Ameriprise Financial is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.
