And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up.

Welcome both of you to the show."", ""And Zach, maybe I'll start with you. And we can start just kind of big picture. Zach, you know this sector very well. You know the names."", ""I'm just interested kind of broadly, Zach. What are you seeing? How healthy and resilient does this sector look? What are the underlying demand trends look like to you?"", ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, thanks for having me. So, in the US, you're starting to see a little bit of weakening. And that's kind of been happening over the last 12 months as the US consumer kind of deals with a lot of different headwinds."", ""So in the US, you're seeing a little bit of a weakening. But nothing scary. It's not the apocalypse. The world's not ending."", ""But you're seeing a softening there. And then internationally, it's kind of company by company. Some companies are pretty much able to grow at will while others have kind of struggled."", ""So you've seen that with Lululemon and Nike after hours yesterday. Lululemon was able to grow 78% in China, which is pretty incredible. And then Nike only had 6% growth."", ""So Europe was a little weak for Nike. But you know, Lululemon doesn't really talk much about other markets outside of China other than just their international market. But yeah, I mean, we think it's kind of a win or loser market."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Sharon, let's get your take on this, too. Where we are in the consumer spending spectrum and how willing, in particular, I think US consumers are to spend on athleisure right now?"", ""SHARON ZACKFIA: Yeah, I mean, I think in the broader context, we continue to see consumers shift to spending on more experiences versus goods. Athleisure is not immune to that. But if you look Athleisure in the context of the broader apparel category, the trends look very good relative to the broader space. So we're seeing resiliency within Athleisure that I think is different than what we see in broader apparel."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And Zack, let's dig into some specific names here. Talk Lululemon. They reported. Obviously, Zach, investors were disappointed."", 'But you go from buy to strong buy on the ratings, Zach. How come? Walk us through that.', ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, so in the last five years or so, you've only had a couple of opportunities to buy Lululemon at under 30 times forward earnings. And right now, they're trading roughly at 28 times. And so we see that opportunity for a great company."", ""Lulus operating margins continue to trend higher. Obviously, they've got growth in China and internationally. They're seeing a little bit of softening in the US. And that kind of I think is where shares slid last night was once CEO came on and said that they were seeing weakness here."", 'But we think this is a great buying opportunity. And we love the company. We think the company is one of those, they guide really conservative usually. And then they raised throughout the year.', ""So we think this is a starting point. We think they'll continue to raise guidance. Our estimates for next year are much higher than what they have."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and Sharon, I know you're positive on Lululemon as well. Do you agree with Zach that this is the typical Lulu playbook where they're just being overly conservative, or should investors be concerned about the slowing that Calvin MacDonald referred to?"", ""SHARON ZACKFIA: Yeah, and I think just to level set. Lululemon's trends in the US were very healthy through January. So we're talking about six weeks of a slightly slower trend."", ""February is usually not the tail that wags the dog in broader retail sales. And there are some inventory dynamics that they alluded to. Having better depth in smaller sizes, having more color, these are things they can fix. So it's not all macro."", ""And I do agree. I mean, this is a company that has a very long history of exceeding its initial guide. We think inventory adjustments. And the marketing activations that they're doing of which there will be three major ones this quarter are probably not fully contemplated as positive wild cards in this guidance. So we think there is room for this guidance to prove beatable."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right, two believers there in Lululemon. Zach, I want to turn to another name that did report did disappoint that'd be Nike. It's down about 7% in today's trade. You went to a hold on that name, Zach. Why a hold? What kept you from going to a buy?"", ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, so we had Nike as a so. We've kind of been back and forth sell and hold on Nike over the past two or three years. And we just think we're just concerned on where they're going to get their next level of growth."", ""Obviously, we love the brand. We know that it's a worldwide global brand. And one of the largest in apparel and footwear."", ""And we love the balance sheet. That's never been the issue. They buy back a lot of shares."", ""We're having a trouble figuring out where they're going to get their next level of growth. They saturated the US market. They saw a pop there during inflation."", ""So, obviously, as they raised prices, they saw a boost in revenues in the US. But the US is saturated. There's some areas of growth in Europe that they can kind of head towards, and you know, soccer, and some other sports but."", ""Outside of that, and then China's really been disappointing, too. So we're just going to wait and see here. We think there's got to be a better opportunity to buy Nike. And we'd rather wait and see, be patient, and hold here just because we're not sure where they're going to get growth from."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And Sharon, you don't cover Nike, but you do cover Under Armour. And we just got recently got bombshell news about the departure of CEO Stephanie Linnartz who hasn't been there very long. And Kevin Blank coming back. I believe you're still positive on the name. You still think investors should buy it. Why?"", 'SHARON ZACKFIA: I mean, I think Stephanie architected a big change in leadership over the last year. And 2/3 of the leadership is new. Kevin was involved to our understanding in those acquisitions of talent.', 'And we think, basically, the goal here is to steer the ship towards growth in the US. They have not had that sustainably for quite a while in terms of revenue. But also harvest more margin.', ""And so we've thought of this year as a margin of harvesting year as the new creative team and new leadership has the opportunity to really lay the foundation for better revenue growth in 2025. I think that all stays intact. But obviously, we'll have to hear what Kevin has to say on the next call."", ""But he has been there. He's been chair and brand chief. So, presumably, he has been involved in much of this strategy as well."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Sharon, Zack, thank you both so much for joining us today.

The high costs of home ownership due to high interest rates are likely to keep renter demand up in its markets, benefiting the company. A focus on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive margin expansion and operational efficiency act as tailwinds. However, the elevated supply of rental units in some markets and high interest rates make us apprehensive.', ""Equity Residential has a dominating presence in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California. The residential REIT is also growing its presence in Denver, CO; Atlanta, GA; Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin, TX. It is particularly targeting places where affluent renters prefer to live, work and play.In its strategy, the company is taking into consideration the hybrid working environment and the recent migration trends of affluent renters and opting for the acquisition and development of properties in suburban locations of its established markets and adding select new markets like its entry into Atlanta, GA, and Austin, TX.Moreover, given the high cost of homeownership, especially relative to rents, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult in its markets, making renting apartment units a viable option. For 2024, we estimate the company’s total rental revenues to exhibit year-over-year growth of 2.3%.Equity Residential is also banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. In recent years, the company has used technology and mobility to improve staffing and utilization, and its concerted efforts that are in the process include smart home, smart building, asset tagging, enhanced data and analytics, centralization expansion, outsourcing and building-wide Wi-Fi implementation.Such efforts are likely to provide Equity Residential with a competitive edge over others and drive growth in net operating income (NOI) in the upcoming period. While our estimate indicates a marginal year-over-year rise in the company's NOI for 2024, the metric is further projected to increase 2.3% and 7.1% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.On the balance sheet front, the company had nearly $2.1 billion of liquidity and a net debt to normalized EBITDAre of 4.12X as of Dec 31, 2023. Also, unencumbered NOI as a percentage of the total NOI was 89.8% in the quarter. An A-rated balance sheet renders the company access to the debt market at favorable rates. Hence, with manageable debt maturities, a large pool of high-quality unencumbered assets and solid credit metrics, EQR seems well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities."", 'Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 5.4% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.3%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The struggle to lure renters remains consistent as the supply volume of residential apartment units is expected to remain elevated in some of the markets where the company operates. With the ongoing construction standing at a high level, a sizeable number of apartment deliveries are anticipated in the upcoming period. This will likely weigh on the company’s ability to increase rent, restricting its growth momentum to a certain extent. The company expects same-store revenue growth to be within 2.0-3.0% this year.Further, given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Equity Residential may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the broader REIT sector are SL Green Realty SLG and Lamar Advertising LAMR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for MetLife ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for MetLife is:', '5.3% = US$1.6b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, MetLife has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Insurance industry classification."", ""That certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high.  Our risks dashboard should have the 4 risks we have identified for MetLife."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.', ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by MetLife, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.60. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.', 'But note: MetLife may not be the best stock to buy.

Yawger advises, however, that gas prices are unlikely to trend much higher: the refineries have learned their lesson following COVID when the price shot up to $5 and demand tanked. ""They will try to feather the price somewhere around $3.50...They know what will happen if gas gets to $5,"" Yawger says.', 'The outlook for oil is exacerbated by China\'s demand situation. Following COVID, China ""rallied the market to the moon,"" but according to Yawger, ""that\'s not in the cards any time soon."" India, however, could be a future demand agent: Yawger explains that the nation\'s substantial population will soon be driving gas-guzzling used American vehicles. With this in mind, Yawger projects peak oil production won\'t occur until 2035.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Gabriel Roy."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Oil prices sinking again in today's trade. That's after climbing earlier this week. With more, we're now joined by Bob Yawger, executive director of Energy Futures at Mizuho Americas. Bob, it's good to have you here."", 'BOB YAWGER: Thank you for having me.', ""JOSH LIPTON: So oil is interesting to think about here, just the push and pull, Bob. You think about geopolitical conflict, but on the other hand stronger dollar to consider. Looking at oil, just under 81 here. Where do you think we're headed, Bob, just in the near to intermediate term?"", ""BOB YAWGER: Well, on top of the geopolitics involved, we're two months away from driving season. So right now, the refineries in this country are going to start to ramp up. They're going to take a lot of crude oil through the refinery. This is a seasonal thing that happens every year."", ""We had a big pop in demand in the last two weeks in the month of March, which is very rare. And we had gasoline outpace crude oil to the upside. That's one of the things that sparked crude oil to the new high, the new multi-month high that we put in this week earlier in the week."", ""And this last storage report though that demand number sagged a little bit, but it's a very good sign that demand is very strong. It's at 9 million barrels a day. The all-time record is 10 million barrels a day and that was in the summertime in 2021."", ""JULIE HYMAN: I want to-- we'll go back to oil, but I do want to ask a little bit more about gasoline because so many drivers are paying so much attention to it. There are political implications of where gasoline goes. So do you think we will continue to see that trend higher more than it seasonally does in summer?"", 'BOB YAWGER: Well, I think that the refiner has learned his lesson. We came out of COVID, the perception was that the US driver wanted to drive all over the place and burn through gasoline like there was no tomorrow. And the price at the pump got as high as $5 a gallon. It killed the golden goose. The driver stopped driving and the refiner was basically left holding the barrel.', ""Prices fell accordingly very quickly and I think they've learned their lesson from that. They will probably try and feather the price in there somewhere around $3.50 at the most, maybe $4. We're basically $3.25 right now-ish. And they know what will happen if we get to $5. They'll lose demand rather quickly."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So that's good news then for people who are driving--"", 'BOB YAWGER: It is good news, yeah.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --around.', ""BOB YAWGER: It is. And I think there's some political pressure on not to get there also as a function of inflation also."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And Bob, I want to get your take too, you look at China still kind of shaky over there. How does that play into your outlook for oil?', ""BOB YAWGER: It's not good at all. That's a big number right there. Their demand-- they were the reason why we were able to get to where we are now post COVID, post negative prices."", ""When demand slid off the face of the Earth at the beginning of COVID and we went to negative prices, two things happened. Saudi's cut production and China eventually emerged and was the big demand engine that rallied the market to the moon. That's not going to happen anymore. It doesn't look like that's in the cards for anytime soon."", ""So they're not going to-- it's not going to be demand destruction, but they're going to stay at this level to maybe a couple of barrels higher. But they're not going to take the market and run higher with it. And that's a dilemma for the folks at OPEC."", ""They need that demand. They're starting to increasingly look to India as maybe the future demand engine. So that's a different situation--"", 'JOSH LIPTON: How realistic is that, Bob?', ""BOB YAWGER: There's 1.3 million people there. A lot of them don't drive at all at this point. And they're going to be buying old cars from the United States that we ship to India. And the rest of the world will be shipping."", ""And those are gas guzzlers. The largest refinery in the world is the 1 million barrel per day reliance refinery. That's a monster and it's there for a reason."", 'JULIE HYMAN: As we were talking before we came on air that I was in Houston at CERAWeek this week, which is the big oil and gas conference annually. And there has been, sort of, a renewed push back amongst the oil industry about the energy transition, right? You had the Saudi Aramco CEO calling the idea that we are moving away from oil and gas right now a fantasy and that we need to invest more. Where are you on the question of, like, peak demand where we are on that continuum?', ""BOB YAWGER: Well, it's two sides to this story basically. First of all, the ECO Clean Energy Index for starters, it's trading at multi-year lows. So as a combined index with 75 names in it, it's getting killed. It's not working."", 'A lot of the names in that index are just not cost effective. The technologies cannot compete with fossil fuel at the end of the day. And the people involved have stepped back a little bit from that space as a result.', ""On the other hand, we're going to be-- we're going to set the new demand number probably in 2035-ish. So you still have 10 years. We have to work through this Indian situation for starters also, other emerging third world countries. They're not going to be driving new Teslas anytime soon and that's going to put the peak oil story on the back burner for a while."", ""Now, there are some clean energy companies that are doing really well on the other hand. Like, Constellation Energy is a utility that is nuclear and has a lot of clean energy mixture also. That's the third best performing name in the S&P 500 this year. So there's a certain rotation away from the Magnificent Seven into the old school name and they seem to be the darling of that switch."", ""So there's other names like [INAUDIBLE] is doing great. They're a provider of clean energy infrastructure to a lot of people that participate. So there are two sides to that story. But fossil fuel is not going to go. It's not going to evaporate from the scene anytime soon."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Right, yeah.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Bob, thanks so much for joining us today. Appreciate it.', 'BOB YAWGER: Thank you.

I mean, still holding up above that psychological $80-a-barrel level. Now, you do have the US dollar index, which is higher today.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Ralph Lauren's shares on or after the 27th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.00 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Ralph Lauren has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of US$187.60. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Ralph Lauren's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Ralph Lauren paying out a modest 34% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 25% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's positive to see that Ralph Lauren's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Ralph Lauren's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 36% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Ralph Lauren has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.5% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Should investors buy Ralph Lauren for the upcoming dividend? Ralph Lauren has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research."", ""So while Ralph Lauren looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Ralph Lauren you should be aware of."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The 56-year-old Snyder related how he grew up in the tiny town of Huxley, Iowa, population 2,000, the son of an engineer and his artist/art teacher wife.', '“It was\xa0a pretty simple life,” he said. During high school, Snyder played a variety of sports — basketball was his favorite — and while he “was\xa0definitely not\xa0an A student,” he was voted best dressed in his class.', 'In those years he was partial to\xa0Calvin Klein and\xa0Ralph Lauren and spent his summers working to make enough money to buy a great pair of jeans, top or the latest and greatest sneaker.', '“When I was younger, I only had one pair of jeans with holes in it,” he said. “I\xa0always had this feeling that I never had enough.\xa0It\xa0kind of stuck with me.”', 'To make some cash to beef up his wardrobe and indulge his love of clothes, Snyder took on odd jobs. They included one\xa0“detasseling corn,” or removing the tops so the ears wouldn’t sweeten too much and could be used as seed corn.', '“I did it for one summer,” he said. “It’s in the middle of August in Iowa and it’s 100 degrees and there’s nothing around you but fields of corn. But it\xa0definitely convinced\xa0me I better figure out what I want to do.”', 'During college, Snyder was still undecided, turning to architecture and then business after engineering and ultimately, he wound up in Iowa State’s fashion program.', '“I was just finishing my finance degree and doing all these interviews with banks and I had this moment when I said: ‘What am I going to do with my life?’ I was 21 and thought I needed to start over, so I switched majors again.”', 'Earlier, he never thought of fashion as a career but after reading a book by Ralph Lauren, a lightbulb went off.', '“I liked clothes but I never thought I could [make a living doing it],” he said.\xa0“But after reading Ralph’s book, where he touched on how he\xa0started,\xa0I thought I could.', '“My dad gave me weird\xa0looks\xa0but I didn’t care, it was a dream of mine.”', 'That led him to Badowers, where Snyder worked for two and a half years and fell in love with tailoring. “They mainly sold suits and things that went with suits,” he said. “At that point, I was meeting reps from Ralph Lauren, who were coming to talk to us about next season and they would show us mood boards and I would get super excited. Ralph was great at creating a whole story behind a collection and I said, ‘I really want to do this.’ I couldn’t graduate fast enough.”', 'He spent every dollar he made — and more — on clothes, and as a young man, had a closet full of suits. “I probably had eight or 10 suits and that’s quite a few for a 20-year-old kid. But I just love tailoring.”', 'After graduation, Snyder set his sights on New York City and getting his foot in the door with one of the city’s top design houses. By perusing the yellow pages at his local library, he cold-called Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Joseph Abboud and other companies offering his services free as a summer intern.', '“Back then, in the late ‘80s/early ‘90s, they didn’t really have programs for that,” he said. “Ralph Lauren was my ultimate and I would call them at least once a week and ask to speak to the head of men’s design. Once I got to know the names of the people — I kept a log of who was doing what — I would call and say I wanted to speak to John Varvatos and they would connect me. I slowly came up with my own narrative: ‘I’m going to be in New York in a couple of weeks, I’d love to show you my book.’ And they said, ‘Sure, why don’t you come in?’”', 'So he bought a ticket, came to New York and met 12 fashion companies — he wound up getting offers from 10 of them. “I think working for free had a lot of appeal,” he said. “But I came prepared — I came wearing my product. I assumed everybody knew how to sew and do patterns so I was very good about creating not only a portfolio but showing the work I did. They were very impressed that I worked at a tailor shop and knew the craft.”', 'Eventually Snyder snagged an internship at Polo Ralph Lauren — and he was on his way. Over the years, Snyder worked for John Varvatos at Ralph Lauren — “I stalked him for 10 years until he hired me,” he said — and Mickey Drexler at both Old Navy and J.Crew, all in men’s design.', 'He received a lot of advice over the years, some of which sticks with him to this day. His father always said, “If you want to be the best, work for the best,” he recalled, and he watched in awe as Drexler exhibited his innate talent to always pick the hot items. “The thing I learned from him is most merchants buy based on last year’s success. But the few that are really good are the ones who go big on things, and Mickey was a genius at that. To this day, I show him my catalogue and he nails my bestseller without even knowing any of my numbers.', '“There’s really no school that teaches what we do. It’s kind of a unique science that he created and a lot of people who worked for him have become very successful.”', 'That includes Snyder, who broke out during his time working for Drexler at J.Crew. It was there that he created an entirely new suit silhouette, The Ludlow, for the retailer’s first stand-alone men’s store, The Liquor Store in TriBeCa.', '“Mickey was obsessed with making men’s more popular so I worked with our tailors and created this whole new suit from scratch that was more fitted,” he said. “Back then, Thom Browne was hot with the whole shrunken suit thing. And I wanted to create our own version at J.Crew.”', 'It worked — The Liquor Store began attracting a fashion customer — and it gave Snyder the confidence he needed to launch his own brand.', 'He took the plunge at the same time the country fell into a recession. But thanks to this little side hustle he and his brother had created called Tailgate Clothing Co., which sold college-themed merchandise, he was able to survive.', 'The Todd Snyder brand began to carve out a niche for its modern American menswear and in 2015, he realized it was challenging to operate both that and Tailgate, so he started looking for options. He talked to several big players in the fashion industry including G-III and PVH, and wound up selling his entire business to American Eagle Outfitters for $11 million.', 'At the time the Todd Snyder brand was doing around $4 million in sales and American Eagle’s chief, Jay Schottenstein, has said he envisions it as a $500 million business within the next three to four years.', 'To achieve that goal, Snyder will open at least five stores this year on the Upper East Side of New York, Los Angeles, San Jose, Calif., and other cities. He’s also reentering the wholesale business and his runway show in January at Pitti Uomo, where he was a featured designer brought him recognition on a global stage.', 'And while Snyder is contemplating other growth opportunities, including womenswear and home, his primary focus right now remains his collection and his stores.', '“When I started thinking about doing a store, I really wanted to make it feel like the experience I had at Badowers,” he said. “It was an old school menswear haberdasher and we were taught to know every customer by name and call them Mister. It was this gentlemanly way that I wanted to preserve. Today, customers come in because they need to buy something for an event or whatever, but you put a jacket or the right shirt or shoe on them, and all of a sudden, you see their confidence come alive. And that for me is the magic of retail. You can’t get that online or through mail order. That’s the thing I wanted to capture. It’s the ultimate customer service.”', 'Next up for Mallis in her series will be Snyder’s former J.Crew colleague, Jenna Lyons, on April 17 at 7:30 p.m. at 92NY.', 'Best of WWD', ""Which British Royal Is Heir to Prince Philip's Style Crown?"", 'Milan Men’s Fashion Week to Attract JW Anderson, 1017 Alyx 9SM, 44 Label Group', ""Men Need Five Shoe Styles, According to Doucal's""]"

Total U.S. output, which came ahead of our projection of 330,000 BOE/d, comprised approximately 56% oil, or 198,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favored the company’s quarterly performance. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 144,000 BOE/d, surging 58.2% from the fourth-quarter 2022 level, while output from Bakken was 118,000 BOE/d compared with 94,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter.

The recent gains have come in a somewhat unusual way and could have major ramifications for performance over the next year or two. Consider this trend\xa0and its implications, and make sure your investment allocation makes sense in that context."", ""The S&P 500's performance is often considered synonymous with the overall stock market's performance. Other major indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial, provide a slightly different view based on sector and industry."", ""If these indexes are all up, it's generally fair to assume that the market, as a whole, would be doing well. Some stocks will struggle during any long periods, but gains elsewhere will more than offset those losses when indexes rise."", ""Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has returned 33.5%, while the Nasdaq is up 42.3%. It's tempting to see that information and conclude that there's been broad strength in corporate financial performance and surging investor sentiment. That's a mostly fair assessment. Average sales and earnings are growing among S&P 500 constituents, and investor sentiment is relatively bullish."", ""On the surface, everything seems positive, but there's an uncommon trend bubbling beneath the headline data. It might be consequential for investors who ignore it."", 'Most indexes are weighted by market capitalization. That means that stocks with higher valuations make up larger proportions of any index. That methodology makes sense -- the biggest companies have outsized impacts on overall economic activity and shareholder results, so index weighting should reflect that.', 'That leads to a significant concentration in market indexes. The 50 largest companies in the S&P account for nearly 60% of the index. Microsoft is 7% of the S&P on its own. A small number of stocks are exerting significant influence over most measurements of total market performance.', 'Alternatively, some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are equal-weighted, so company size and valuation have no bearing on portfolio allocation. Each stock held by these funds will contribute equally to overall performance.', ""By tracking the performance of equal-weighted funds, you can determine whether smaller stocks are sharing in the total market's performance. Comparing the performance of equal-weighted funds to market-weighted indexes is illuminating, especially if something unusual is happening. And that's exactly what's going on right now."", ""The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT: RSP) has lagged the S&P 500 index by nearly 14 percentage points over the past year. There's a similar gap between the Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted ETF (NYSEMKT: QQQE) and the Nasdaq."", ""The equal-weighted funds performed well over the past year. Those are above-average rates of return, but it's clear that most stocks aren't thriving to the same extent as the largest ones. If you just look at index performance, there's no way to recognize this fact."", ""There could be a number of reasons for that performance gap, but there's a good chance that the recent divergence isn't sustainable. If that's the case, there are serious ramifications for the stock market over the next couple of years."", ""History suggests that the biggest stocks don't stray too far from the rest of the market over the long term. Some of the tech giants have enjoyed strong momentum during recent bull markets, but equal-weight ETFs have tended to keep pace with their cap-weighted cousins."", 'Something changed over the past year.

Widespread concerns about consumer strength and high interest rates kept investors from going all-in on riskier growth stocks. They were concerned that if the economy dipped into recession, volatility would likely wipe out shareholder value.', 'However, the prospect of upcoming rate cuts by the Federal Reserve made asset managers hesitant to allocate too conservatively. The Magnificent Seven offer a rare combination of reliability and above-average growth potential. This attracted a lot of capital last year, with hedge funds and retailers buying up these stocks during the opening stages of the artificial intelligence (AI) craze.', 'These companies have been posting encouraging financial results, but their surging prices were driven, at least in part, by valuation inflation. Most of that group became significantly more expensive relative to sales and forecast earnings.', 'The Magnificent Seven now trade at premium valuations. Unless they continue to deliver financial results that significantly outpace the rest of the market, valuations will likely move back toward more of an equilibrium, based on future cash flow. If that happens, these high-flying tech giants might see bigger losses in the next market correction, or the rest of the index may close the gap throughout this bull market.', ""That's why it's so important for investors to monitor their portfolio concentration and avoid getting too greedy. There are a lot of great stocks available on the market. It's OK to ride with some high-conviction stocks, but it's wise to rebalance your portfolio periodically when relative valuations change. Don't abandon your long-term investment thesis, but recognize that last year's winners won't necessarily be this year's winners."", ""It doesn't matter whether you're an index investor or holding some of these stocks individually.

However, market improvements have paved the way for a recovery over the last year, with countless tech stocks on the rise. As a result, it's not a bad time to invest in the video games sector and profit from its development over the next decade."", 'Rapidly expanding markets like virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are bound to boost video game stocks in the coming years. So here are two gaming stocks to buy in March.', ""Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business exploded last year as its chips became the gold standard for AI developers everywhere.

In addition to gaming, Intel's venture into GPUs is promising for its growing prospects in AI."", ""This chart shows Intel's earnings could reach just under $3 per share by fiscal 2026.

Now, those processors are so last year."", 'On Monday, Nvidia unveiled the Blackwell platform ""to power a new era of computing.""

Sell-offs in the stock market happen all the time, and investors who take advantage of those deals have historically done very well."", 'But so many investors miss out on gains during bull markets just because it is counterintuitive to buy a stock at a far higher price than it used to be. Often, the best stocks to buy are hiding in plain sight. Microsoft is perhaps the best example of this.', ""It became the largest U.S.-based company by market cap in the late 1990s, lost its position during the dot-com bust, regained it in the early 2000s, was surpassed by ExxonMobil, sold off heavily after the financial crisis of 2008, and didn't exceed its dot-com bubble high until 2017."", ""Microsoft was on the sidelines when acronyms like FANG for Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (part of parent company Alphabet) emerged to highlight the market's hottest growth stocks. But it was growing the whole time, namely through cloud infrastructure. Microsoft was a lead investor in OpenAI. On top of that, its business was perfectly set up to monetize AI in the near term and the long term."", 'In 2017, investors were happy Microsoft had recovered its post-dot-com bust losses. But the stock is now up over five times from that peak and nearly 250% in the last five years alone. Microsoft had its periods of lackluster growth.

In its second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call, Microsoft said it had over 1 million Copilot for Security customers.', ""The cybersecurity solution uses AI to protect against unauthorized intrusions and could be particularly useful for protecting cloud infrastructure, enhancing Microsoft Azure, and fueling growth for Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business segment. According to Microsoft, security professionals were 22% faster and 7% more accurate when using Copilot for Security."", 'Copilot for Security joins a growing list of Copilots -- including GitHub Copilot for developers, Copilot for Microsoft 365, DAX Copilot in healthcare, and other AI offerings like Azure AI and AI features for LinkedIn.', 'In a relatively short amount of time, Microsoft has successfully leveraged AI across its business-to-business and business-to-consumer sales channels -- accelerating growth in the process.', ""Microsoft's growth has been the main contributing factor to the stock's incredible run. But an often-overlooked part of the investment thesis is its capital return program and balance sheet."", 'Microsoft pays more dividends than any other U.S.-based company. Over the last three years, it has increased its dividend by over a third and reduced its overall share count despite its trailing-12-month stock-based compensation expense ballooning to over $10 billion.', ""Microsoft uses stock-based compensation to attract top talent, but it's been a winning strategy. Microsoft is driving higher profits and can more than offset that expense with buybacks. This is a far different dynamic than companies that don't do buybacks and dilute their existing shareholders with stock-based compensation."", 'As for the balance sheet, the company finished Dec. 31, 2023 with $17.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $63.7 billion in short-term investments (namely government securities and bonds), $27 billion in short-term debt, and $44.9 billion in long-term debt.', 'Despite rapidly increasing its operating expenses and capital expenditures over the last few years (not to mention fueling buybacks and dividend growth), Microsoft still has less debt on its balance sheet than cash, equivalents, and short-term investments.', ""If you were to glance at Microsoft, it's easy to say that the stock is overvalued and worth selling. An all-time high price paired with years of outsized gains makes it look ripe for a sell-off. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is up to 37.7, which is well above its five-year median P/E of 32.1, and the 10-year median is less than 30. And the overall market has rallied nicely in 2024 after a massive run in 2023."", ""Despite all of this, Microsoft still isn't overvalued because of the quality and diversification of its business, market positioning, capital return program, balance sheet, and, most importantly, a clear and defined roadmap for monetizing AI for years to come."", ""Microsoft is a complicated business, but its strategy is fairly straightforward. It has many touchpoints with businesses and consumers, and it uses those touchpoints to see what is and isn't working with its products and services. Today, it is simply taking that strategy a step further with AI.

This, in turn, increased the stock price of many semiconductor chip providers, notably Nvidia.', 'Veteran chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was among those with a surging stock price over the past year, reaching a 52-week high of $51.28 in December. Since then, however, Intel shares have dropped.', ""This could signal a buy opportunity. But don't let the current excitement around AI cloud your judgment. Not all semiconductor companies can achieve the success Nvidia has experienced.\xa0So, before scooping up Intel shares, it's best to understand whether the company makes sense as a long-term investment."", 'Intel underwent a remarkable turnaround over the past year. The company started 2023 with first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion, which represents a 36% year-over-year decline. The veteran tech giant also suffered a Q1 net loss of $2.8 billion, compared to net income of $8.1 billion in 2022.', 'Intel was a different company by the end of 2023. Its $15.4 billion in revenue was a 10% year-over-year increase, and it was once again profitable with Q4 net income of roughly 2.7 billion, thanks to $3 billion in cost cuts.', ""Intel's Q4 sales benefited from strong PC demand. Over the long term, the chipmaker is focused on its integrated device manufacturing (IDM) model as its strategy to maintain revenue growth."", 'IDM involves the company both designing and building its own semiconductor chips. By contrast, Nvidia is a fabless chipset maker, meaning it outsources the fabrication of its semiconductors.', ""Intel is confident it will continue to see year-over-year sales growth in every quarter of 2024. For Q1, the company forecasted revenue of at least $12.2 billion, up from 2023's $11.7 billion."", ""Intel management is touting what they call IDM 2.0 as a competitive advantage in the era of AI, given the demanding hardware requirements of AI systems. IDM 2.0 entails opening up Intel's foundries -- used to make the company's semiconductors -- to other organizations."", 'The company believes offering its foundry capabilities to others is a successful strategy because it allows Intel to efficiently build AI chips to the specifications of its customers. According to CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel is ""the only semiconductor company with at-scale and sustainable manufacturing in every major region of the world.""', ""This positions Intel to deliver products faster while remaining resilient against supply chain bottlenecks. With IDM 2.0, Intel seeks to become the second-largest foundry in the world by 2030, behind leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which dominates today's semiconductor manufacturing industry."", ""Intel is in the early stages of IDM 2.0. In 2023, the company's foundry services accounted for only $952 million of the company's $54.3 billion in revenue."", ""But Intel's foundry aspirations may be on the cusp of substantial growth. In February, the company announced its foundry business secured deals worth more than $15 billion over their lifetimes, capturing customers such as Microsoft."", ""Intel's foundry business is showing promise with these new deals. And this division's $952 million in 2023 revenue was a 103% increase over 2022."", 'But expanding its foundry capacity to meet customer demand will be a substantial capital expenditure. For example, when Intel announced it was building two new factories in 2021, it quoted a cost of $20 billion.', ""Moreover, despite the strong demand for AI-powering chips, Intel's data and AI division generated $15.5 billion in revenue last year, down from $19.4 billion in the year prior. This indicates Intel still has to prove it can succeed against rivals in the AI race."", ""The other consideration is the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Intel's P/E ratio of 105 exceeds Nvidia's 76, suggesting Intel's current stock price is already lofty."", 'Corroborating this is the prediction among Wall Street analysts of a median price target of $45.07 for Intel stock. This illustrates a belief among analysts of little upside for Intel shares right now.', ""With a high valuation and limited success demonstrated in Intel's financials so far, at this time, it's best to wait and see how the company performs over the next couple of quarters before deciding to invest.\xa0If its operations continue Q4's encouraging performance, then Intel may become an attractive long-term investment.

This takes the annual payment to 1.3% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying."", ' See our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers ', ""It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Signet Jewelers' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 31.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 8.2%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.60 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.16. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.8% a year over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once."", 'Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Signet Jewelers has impressed us by growing EPS at 58% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.', ""Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

The world's biggest retailer of diamond jewelry continued to face headwinds from value-conscious consumers as same-store sales (comps) in the quarter fell 9.6%, and overall revenue, which benefited from an extra week, was down 6.3% to $2.5 billion, short of estimates at $2.55 billion."", 'Despite the sales decline, its new products performed well, and the company cut inventory levels by 10%, allowing it to achieve higher gross margins and lifting its adjusted operating margin from 15.2% to 16.4%.', 'For fiscal 2025, the company expects comps to land between a decline of 4.5% and a 0.5% gain. Its revenue forecast of $6.66 billion to $7.02 billion was below the consensus, as was its adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.08 to $10.48, below estimates at $10.57.', 'Despite the weaker-than-expected guidance, here is why Signet still looks well-positioned for long-term growth:', ""Close to half of Signet's revenue comes from the bridal jewelry segment, and engagements have been down in the last couple of years due to a delay in new relationships from the pandemic."", 'Now, that trend is starting to reverse. In an interview with The Motley Fool, Chief Financial Officer Joan Hilson said, ""We had predicted a trough toward the end of the third quarter, and we predicted that engagement would begin to rebound in the fourth quarter, and that is in fact what we are seeing.""', 'Signet said the recovery in engagements would be weighted toward the back half of this year and would continue for the next three years. For fiscal 2025, which ends next January, the company expects engagement activity to increase 5% to 10% in the U.S. The engagement recovery should give the company a valuable high-margin tailwind over the next few years.', 'For the fourth year in a row, Signet generated more than $600 million in free cash flow, adjusted for a one-time legal settlement, meaning the stock trades at less than 7 times free cash flow. Its financial position continues to improve as its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent (EBITDAR) fell to a multiple of 2.3 at the end of the quarter, and the company reduced its leverage target from a 2.75 ratio to 2.5 in a sign of confidence in future cash flow.', 'As a result of its reliable cash flow and an improving balance sheet, Signet raised its quarterly dividend by 26% to $0.29 per share. Hilson said, ""One of our commitments within our capital allocation priority is to consistently be a dividend growth company."" The increase was the company\'s third consecutive hike after it suspended its dividend when the pandemic started.', 'Signet also raised its share buyback allocation by $200 million to $850 million, setting it up for continued buybacks as the stock looks undervalued trading at less than 7 times free cash flow. It reduced shares outstanding by roughly 5% last year.', ""Signet's business should return to growth by the back half of the year as the company benefits from a recovery in engagements and implements a new $350 million cost-savings program, which should continue to drive margins higher."", ""Meanwhile, there is more room for the company to return capital to shareholders as its price-to-earnings ratio is less than 9, and its cash position continues to improve. Signet has historically grown both organically and through acquisitions such as Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile, but if it doesn't spend on acquisitions, the company is left with a ton of cash to return to shareholders."", ""Its quarterly dividend is still below the $0.37 per share it paid before the pandemic started when the business was smaller, and it's likely to top that level in the coming years."", 'Recent quarterly results have been marred by revenue declines, but that should soon change with the help of the rebound in engagements. Combine that with its proven track record of margin improvements and its cheap valuation, and Signet looks like a good bet to deliver solid gains this year and reward shareholders with dividend increases and share buybacks over the longer term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Signet Jewelers right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Signet Jewelers, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Signet Jewelers wasn’t one of them.

One sector that currently offers some satisfying payouts is the beverage industry. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) boast dividend yields of 2.5% or higher, putting them well above the S&P 500's current dividend yield of less than 1.4%. "", ""Here's why those seeking to collect more dividend income should look closer at these beverage stocks."", ""Coca-Cola's dividend yields 3.2%. The beverage giant has an exceptional record of increasing its dividend payments. It gave its investors a 5.4% raise earlier this year. That marked its 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase. It kept Coca-Cola in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of dividend increases. "", ""The company's dividend isn't likely to fizzle out anytime soon. The beverage behemoth's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4% to 6% per year by raising prices and increasing volumes. That should drive 7% to 9% annual earnings-per-share growth and healthy free cash flow growth. "", ""That growing free cash flow, which should total $9.2 billion this year, will give Coca-Cola the funds to pay a growing dividend ($8 billion in 2023) and repurchase shares while maintaining its elite balance sheet. The company's financial strength gives it the flexibility to make acquisitions as compelling opportunities arise to add a little more pop to its already solid growth profile. "", ""Keurig Dr Pepper doesn't have quite the dividend-paying track record of Coca-Cola. However, it offers a 2.9% dividend yield. Meanwhile, the company has grown its dividend at an 11% compound annual rate over the last three years. It was able to add some more pop to the payout after achieving its leverage target following the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, which created North America's third-largest beverage company. "", ""Dividend growth is a key aspect of the company's strategy. It currently has a relatively low dividend payout ratio (45%), which enables it to retain lots of cash for debt reduction, share repurchases, and opportunistic investments. Since the merger, Keurig Dr. Pepper has cut its leverage ratio in half, from about 6 to around 3, while also investing more than $2.5 billion into high-growth category platforms and making $2.2 billion of opportunistic share repurchases over the past three years. "", ""Keurig Dr Pepper's long-term ambition is to deliver mid-single-digit net sales growth while increasing its earnings per share at a high single-digit rate. That should enable the company to generate growing free cash flow to increase its dividend while giving it the optionality to opportunistically repurchase shares and make acquisitions. "", ""Starbucks has the lowest yield in this group at 2.5%. However, that's still a lot higher than the S&P 500. Further, the coffee giant has done a tremendous job increasing its dividend over the years. It has grown its payout at a 20% compound annual rate since initiating the dividend 13 years ago, including by 7.5% last September. "", 'The company should be able to continue growing its dividend in the future. It launched its bold triple shot reinvention strategy last year. It plans to become more global by accelerating its store expansion to 55,000 locations worldwide by 2030 (up from around 38,000 at the end of last year). The company also aims to unlock efficiency gains to save $3 billion in costs over the next three years. ', ""These catalysts should drive caffeinated revenue and earnings growth. The company's long-term target is to grow its revenue by more than 10% annually while delivering 15%+ earnings growth. That faster growth could enable Starbucks to deliver accelerated dividend growth in the future. "", ""Coca-Cola, Keurig Dr Pepper, and Starbucks can quench an investor's thirst for more income. The beverage giants pay higher-yielding dividends that should continue growing in the future.

Here's why Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) made the cut."", ""Jeremy Bowman (Cava Group): Cava Group is one of the more intriguing IPOs to come on the market recently. It's a fast-casual chain that's drawn comparisons to Chipotle Mexican Grill for good reason."", ""Cava offers a similar menu to Chipotle, using Mediterranean cuisine instead of Mexican. It serves rolled-up pita wraps that closely resemble burritos, and it also offers bowls. Even its restaurant design resembles Chipotle's with a minimalist industrial decor."", ""Cava's financial results have also been impressive in its brief period as a publicly traded company. In its fourth-quarter earnings report, the company reported a 52.5% increase in revenue to $175.5 million, driven by an 11.4% increase in same-store sales and aggressive store openings, as its store base increased 30% to 309."", 'Other data points show its restaurants are also popular as average unit volumes, or the average annual revenue from its restaurants, was $2.6 million. That is stronger than most of its peers, and the double-digit comparable sales growth shows that number is rapidly moving higher.', 'On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company is minimally profitable. However, its restaurant-level profit margins are strong at 24.8% for 2023, indicating that GAAP profit margins should ramp up as the company expands and its corporate costs moderate.', 'Cava also has a strong management pedigree, with Panera Founder Ron Shaich serving as its chairman and one of its early investors.', ""The stock has already soared this year, up nearly 70%, but it looks like a good bet to keep climbing as its valuation is still reasonable, and its results have easily beaten estimates so far. Investors seem to be recognizing Cava's long-term growth potential, and the stock should keep gaining as the company executes its growth plan."", ""Jennifer Saibil (MercadoLibre): E-commerce continues to increase as a percentage of overall retail sales, and that shift has retailers of all stripes moving over their operations to meet demand. Some companies have a headstart, and that edge will provide years of growing revenue. E-commerce accounted for 19% of global retail sales in 2023, but it's expected to reach 24% by 2027. That still leaves years of room to grow."", 'MercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce powerhouse in Latin America, serving 85 million customers in 18 countries, with 413 items sold in the 2023 fourth quarter alone. That was a 29% year-over-year increase, and MercadoLibre demonstrates robust growth consistently. Revenue increased 83% over last year (currency neutral) in the fourth quarter, a continuing acceleration.', 'Almost 50% of shipments are now on the MercadoLibre logistics network, leading to improved delivery times for more orders. More than 75% of shipments were delivered within 48 hours, which might be the fastest e-commerce times anywhere. As MercadoLibre gets products to customers faster, it wins their loyalty and their business, resulting in higher revenue and market share. It also filters down to the bottom line. Net income more than doubled in 2023 to $987 million.', ""Let's not forget MercadoLibre's fintech business, which is a high-margin business growing even faster than e-commerce and has an even bigger opportunity. Total payment volume (TPV) increased 153% year over year in the fourth quarter to $56 billion, and off-platform TPV was up 182%. As for its credit business, an outgrowth of the fintech business, the total portfolio increased 33% over last year to $3.8 billion. That drives net income as well."", ""MercadoLibre stock plunged after its fourth-quarter report because earnings per share (EPS) came in below Wall Street's expectations. They took a hit from a one-time tax expense that doesn't impact its operations, and investors may be losing sight of the trees in the forest with the stock dip. But that creates an opportunity for smart investors, and MercadoLibre stock is flashing a huge buy signal right now."", ""John Ballard (Dutch Bros): Finding fast-growing restaurant chains while they are still small can lead to massive returns. A $1,000 investment in Starbucks at its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $273,000 today (excluding dividends). Dutch Bros may not grow into a global brand like Starbucks, but it doesn't have to."", ""At just $254 million in quarterly revenue across 16 states, Dutch Bros has a long runway of growth just in the U.S. It's currently at a similar size as Starbucks in the 1990s, and its menu of hot and cold beverages is catching on. Total system same-shop sales increased 5% in the most recent quarter, with total revenue up 26%. It's just a fraction of the size it could grow into over the next few decades."", ""Dutch Bros is opening new shops while keeping the business hovering around breakeven. It's been operating at a slight adjusted profit over the last year. But its low profit sets up an important catalyst for the stock."", 'Its minuscule profit margin could lead to explosive earnings growth over the next decade as it continues to expand beyond its current footprint in 16 states. Dutch Bros earns a solid contribution margin of 26% across its company-operated shops.', 'Despite continued growth in the business, the stock was a bit expensive at its 2021 IPO, and it subsequently fell in 2022 as same-shop sales slowed over macroeconomic headwinds. But the stock now looks quite attractive at a lower valuation.

The refreshing fizz. The familiar taste that evokes childhood memories and quenches thirst on a hot day. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a brand woven into the fabric of American life, and its stock has been a mainstay in many portfolios for decades.', 'But with the stock recently lagging behind the S&P 500\xa0index, some investors might be wondering: Has the fizz gone flat? Is it too late to buy Coca-Cola stock? Is the beverage industry too stodgy to serve up wealth-building investments nowadays?', ""Hold on just a second before you pour your Coca-Cola investing thesis down the drain. It's true that Coca-Cola hasn't exactly been a rocket ship lately, gaining only 1% in a year compared to the S&P 500's 31% surge, but there's still plenty to like about this beverage behemoth."", ""First off, let's talk valuation. Coca-Cola is currently trading at a reasonable 25 times earnings and 6 times sales. Not exactly a bargain-basement price, but certainly not an outrageous ask for a company with such a dominant market position and consistent performance."", ""Speaking of performance, let's not forget that Coca-Cola has been steadily growing its sales at a 6.5% compound annual rate over the past five years. That's not exactly explosive, but it's certainly nothing to sneeze at for a company of its size and maturity."", 'And it\'s not like Coca-Cola is resting on its laurels, either.

Coca-Cola also owns 19.6% of Monster's stock, giving the soft drink giant a significant financial interest in the energy drink specialist's business growth."", 'But perhaps the most refreshing aspect of Coca-Cola is its robust free cash flow of $9.5 billion over the last four quarters. The company is also strongly committed to returning that cash to shareholders. In the past year alone, the company has repurchased $1.7 billion worth of its own stock and paid out a whopping $8 billion in dividends. That combo hits the spot for income investors with a thirst for cash-sharing programs.', ""So, is it too late to buy Coca-Cola stock? I don't think so."", ""While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the company's strong fundamentals, reasonable valuation, and generous shareholder cash returns add up to plenty of tasty sparkle. The 3.2% dividend yield alone is reason enough to own this stock for the long haul -- just ask Warren Buffett."", 'Coca-Cola is a giant of its industry, as stable as solid rock, and an income-generating cash machine -- and you never know when the company might strike a chord with consumers over a new flavor or an innovative product line.', ""Long-term investors looking for a reliable and refreshing addition to their portfolio should consider grabbing a few shares of Coca-Cola.

70,002051d1-1a8b-3173-be33-5c4936e1a89c,HST,2024-03-23,3 REITs to Pick as the Fed Indicates 3 Rate Cuts in 2024,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-pick-fed-indicates-152300978.html,1711120980,STORY,"['GOOD', 'HST', 'IRM']","['Real estate investment trust (REIT) investors now have reasons to rejoice because although the Fed officials have held the benchmark rate steady at 5.25-5.50% but indicated a three-quarter-percentage-point cut by year-end.Specifically, the Fed officials’ median projections for the federal funds rate by the end of December 2024 have been kept unchanged at 4.6%. For 2025, the Fed now expects the interest rate to fall three-quarters of a percentage point, which is less than the one percentage point guided earlier. With another spate of reductions in 2026, the median projection for the federal funds rate by the end of December 2026 is pegged at 3.1%, while the long-run outlook is pegged at 2.6%.Any rate cut, even a slight one, is good news for the rate-sensitive REIT industry. This is because REITs’ dependence on debt for business keeps investors optimistic about their performances in a rate-cut environment as the companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. Moreover, low interest rates contribute to higher valuations. Also, their dividend yield grabs investors’ attention more than yields on fixed-income and money market accounts in times like these.Apart from making this indication for three rate cuts in the current year, the Fed also revised its forecast for 2024 GDP growth, expecting it to now grow 2.1%, up from 1.4% projected earlier. The FOMC statement acknowledged that “economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace”, as suggested by recent indicators. It further noted, “Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low.”The projections for the U.S. GDP growth rate for 2025 have been upgraded to 2% from the 1.8% stated in December, and the same for 2026 has been revised upward to 2% from 1.9% guided earlier. The projection for 2024 unemployment has been revised to 4% from 4.1% guided earlier.A resilient economy obviously brings in cheers for REITs as it acts as a tailwind for leasing activity. With the REIT industry offering a real-estate structure for several economic activities, real or virtual, the sector’s prospects get a boost when an economy is going strong. This is because a healthy economy entails more economic activities and empowers people to spend more. Demand for real estate shoots up, occupancy goes up, and landlords get more power to command higher rents. Therefore, REITs’ earnings, cash flows and dividends gain strength.Though higher interest rates are likely to limit real estate capital market activity in the first half of the year, the same is expected to tick up once the Fed starts lowering rates as the year progresses.Moreover, with regard to inflation, the Fed pointed out that though inflation “has eased over the past year” but still remains “elevated”. The core PCE inflation projections have now climbed slightly up to 2.6% from 2.4%, and this comes after the sticky inflation reports of recent months.Markedly, REITs provide natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. A majority of leases are tied to inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even amid the inflationary period, investment in the REIT industry can offer a steady stream of income.', 'Here, we have picked three REITs using the Zacks Screener. Apart from having robust fundamentals, these REITs have higher chances of market outperformance. Further, these stocks have been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analyst optimism.Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM: This REIT provides records & information management services and data center space & solutions.

MyBundle Co-Founder and CEO Jason Cohen joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how his business is helping consumers ""shave"" the cord to save money on streaming.', 'Cohen explains how the streaming ecosystem has become complicated: ""Think about steps. Step one is what is the right service for me? That\'s what we\'re doing today. If we fast forward all the way to the end goal, which we are doing with our broadband providers, is our broadband providers are giving not just discounts, but giving them away for free. Sign up for a gig, get $100 of streaming credits. Sign up or upgrade to a gig and we\'ll give you this service six months for free, so we\'re really working with the broadband industry to help make those offers a reality.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""JOSH LIPTON: You've heard of cutting the cord but our next guest is helping consumers shave the cord. MyBundle is helping package streaming and cable options for viewers in a constantly changing streaming landscape. For more, we have MyBundle co-founder and CEO, Jason Cohen. Jason, it's good to have you. Maybe to start, Jason, just for viewers who might not be familiar, just walk us through a little bit more about MyBundle. What do consumers turn to you for?"", 'JASON COHEN: Sure. No, Josh, first, thanks for having me. So we do a bunch of different things, which always makes this fun. The first thing we do is we help consumers, as you said, shave the cord, looking for an alternative to a cable or satellite TV package. We help them find the YouTube TVs, the Hulu Lives, the Slings, which one of them has the channels that they need, which makes it super easy to save a lot of money.', ""So for consumers, we help them do that we also go into finding the best package of streaming services for cord-cutters or cord-nevers, helping you find shows and movies across your services, talk about watch lists and what comes next. So that's how we're helping consumers really navigate this new very complicated streaming ecosystem. And then we partner, which I'm sure we'll get to, but we partner with the broadband industry and the streaming services themselves to really bring it all together and just make the ecosystem work better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Jason, do-- so do people get sort of a discount on any of the services when they're bundled together? I mean, that's something that the likes of Verizon are starting to offer here. Or is this more about tailoring it so people can get the stuff that they want to watch?"", ""JASON COHEN: Yeah, great question. So think about steps, like step one is, what is the right service for me? And that's what we're doing today. If we fast forward all the way to the end goal, which we're doing with our broadband providers, is our broadband providers are giving not just discounts, but giving them away for free. Sign up for a gig, get $100 of streaming credits. Sign up or upgrade to a gig, and we'll give you this service for six months for free. So we're really working with the broadband industry to help make those offers a reality."", ""You mentioned Verizon with their Plus Play. Think of it as Plus Play for the rest of the broadband industry. And there are about 3,000 internet providers out there. It's kind of crazy. And so that platform sitting between those broadband providers and the streaming services out there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And Jason, there's so many streaming services at this point, it's hard to keep track. I mean, do consumers-- do they want all these options? Is there demand there?"", ""JASON COHEN: Yeah. So we think-- from our studies and from other studies and from obviously talking to consumers, it's not that they want less. It just needs to be simple. I say you don't need consolidation in the streaming industry. You do need aggregation. So if it's easy for consumers to bundle if Julie, like you mentioned, if when you-- the more you bundle, the more you save, which is where we think this is all heading, ultimately consumers don't want less. They just need somebody to help them figure it all out and manage it all."", 'JULIE HYMAN: How do you guys make money, Jason? Do you-- do you charge a fee? Do you collect fees from these broadband companies? How does that work?', ""JASON COHEN: Yeah. So again, great question. So a couple of ways. So what we do is basically the broadband providers pay us what we like to think very low monthly SaaS fee. But what this is really also about is actually helping the media companies, the streaming services navigate this world as well. As you listen to their earnings calls, they're all talking about bundling and finding new customers and retaining those customers. And how do they do it?"", 'Well, what MyBundle is doing is aggregating the broadband industry for each streaming service so they only have to come to MyBundle for one integration and get access to we have now over 220 broadband providers with 13 million internet customers that are my bundle partners. And so the second part is getting paid by the streaming services the same way they pay those little companies like Google or Apple or Amazon.', ""The difference is we're not big tech, we're not trying to eat their lunch. We're a little tech, and we're saying we're here to help. And so we earn that revenue from the streaming service and then share that with the broadband provider. And so we're really-- everything MyBundle does it's all about creating those win-win-wins for our consumers, our broadband partners, and the streaming services to make this whole streaming ecosystem a lot simpler."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And you know, Jason, there's a new sports streaming service coming. Disney, Fox, and Warner Brothers teaming up. Just interested to get your thoughts on there. What do you think the reception is going to be like? Is the demand there for that?"", ""JASON COHEN: Yeah. So we know one of the things with our tool is, right, we know what channels people pick and what they're interested. And there definitely are consumers that are more into sports versus not. Just quickly, like before starting MyBundle, I was actually in the finance world. I watched you guys back in my old job at a hedge fund, investing in media and telecom."", ""And the reason we started MyBundle was specifically because the thought was this is all going to fragment with the internet. The internet's going to come, we're going to go from a closed system to an open ecosystem. The middle is going to be messy. We're right now right square in the middle, where there's going to be more services and more choice and more options. And what we're all about is matching up the people that want those channels and don't need the other channels and the idea of helping people find that."", ""And so we do think there is demand. There's a lot more demand for streaming. We think there's going to be a lot more shifting over from traditional facilities-based TV over to streaming. And specifically, whether it's this and then ESPN direct-to-consumer, which will come the next-- which is a skinnier skinny version of that, we think there's going to be more and more options. And that's not a bad thing. But it's not a bad thing as long as a company like MyBundle or some of the other companies like the large, large cable providers or, like you said, Verizon, somebody needs to be there to help the consumer put Humpty Dumpty back together again."", ""And we think Humpty Dumpty, not to kill that metaphor, but it's going to look a lot better. And the end result of this is way, way better for consumers than how it used to be when they have that little bit of help."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Jason, thanks so much. Appreciate it.', 'JASON COHEN: Thank you so much for having me.']"

""They will try to feather the price somewhere around $3.50...They know what will happen if gas gets to $5,"" Yawger says.', 'The outlook for oil is exacerbated by China\'s demand situation. Following COVID, China ""rallied the market to the moon,"" but according to Yawger, ""that\'s not in the cards any time soon."" India, however, could be a future demand agent: Yawger explains that the nation\'s substantial population will soon be driving gas-guzzling used American vehicles.

You think about geopolitical conflict, but on the other hand stronger dollar to consider. Looking at oil, just under 81 here. Where do you think we're headed, Bob, just in the near to intermediate term?"", ""BOB YAWGER: Well, on top of the geopolitics involved, we're two months away from driving season. So right now, the refineries in this country are going to start to ramp up. They're going to take a lot of crude oil through the refinery. This is a seasonal thing that happens every year."", ""We had a big pop in demand in the last two weeks in the month of March, which is very rare. And we had gasoline outpace crude oil to the upside. That's one of the things that sparked crude oil to the new high, the new multi-month high that we put in this week earlier in the week."", ""And this last storage report though that demand number sagged a little bit, but it's a very good sign that demand is very strong. It's at 9 million barrels a day. The all-time record is 10 million barrels a day and that was in the summertime in 2021."", ""JULIE HYMAN: I want to-- we'll go back to oil, but I do want to ask a little bit more about gasoline because so many drivers are paying so much attention to it. There are political implications of where gasoline goes. So do you think we will continue to see that trend higher more than it seasonally does in summer?"", 'BOB YAWGER: Well, I think that the refiner has learned his lesson. We came out of COVID, the perception was that the US driver wanted to drive all over the place and burn through gasoline like there was no tomorrow. And the price at the pump got as high as $5 a gallon. It killed the golden goose. The driver stopped driving and the refiner was basically left holding the barrel.', ""Prices fell accordingly very quickly and I think they've learned their lesson from that. They will probably try and feather the price in there somewhere around $3.50 at the most, maybe $4. We're basically $3.25 right now-ish. And they know what will happen if we get to $5. They'll lose demand rather quickly."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So that's good news then for people who are driving--"", 'BOB YAWGER: It is good news, yeah.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --around.', ""BOB YAWGER: It is.

How does that play into your outlook for oil?', ""BOB YAWGER: It's not good at all. That's a big number right there. Their demand-- they were the reason why we were able to get to where we are now post COVID, post negative prices."", ""When demand slid off the face of the Earth at the beginning of COVID and we went to negative prices, two things happened. Saudi's cut production and China eventually emerged and was the big demand engine that rallied the market to the moon. That's not going to happen anymore. It doesn't look like that's in the cards for anytime soon."", ""So they're not going to-- it's not going to be demand destruction, but they're going to stay at this level to maybe a couple of barrels higher. But they're not going to take the market and run higher with it. And that's a dilemma for the folks at OPEC."", ""They need that demand. They're starting to increasingly look to India as maybe the future demand engine. So that's a different situation--"", 'JOSH LIPTON: How realistic is that, Bob?', ""BOB YAWGER: There's 1.3 million people there. A lot of them don't drive at all at this point. And they're going to be buying old cars from the United States that we ship to India. And the rest of the world will be shipping."", ""And those are gas guzzlers. The largest refinery in the world is the 1 million barrel per day reliance refinery. That's a monster and it's there for a reason."", 'JULIE HYMAN: As we were talking before we came on air that I was in Houston at CERAWeek this week, which is the big oil and gas conference annually. And there has been, sort of, a renewed push back amongst the oil industry about the energy transition, right? You had the Saudi Aramco CEO calling the idea that we are moving away from oil and gas right now a fantasy and that we need to invest more. Where are you on the question of, like, peak demand where we are on that continuum?', ""BOB YAWGER: Well, it's two sides to this story basically. First of all, the ECO Clean Energy Index for starters, it's trading at multi-year lows. So as a combined index with 75 names in it, it's getting killed. It's not working."", 'A lot of the names in that index are just not cost effective. The technologies cannot compete with fossil fuel at the end of the day. And the people involved have stepped back a little bit from that space as a result.', ""On the other hand, we're going to be-- we're going to set the new demand number probably in 2035-ish. So you still have 10 years. We have to work through this Indian situation for starters also, other emerging third world countries. They're not going to be driving new Teslas anytime soon and that's going to put the peak oil story on the back burner for a while."", ""Now, there are some clean energy companies that are doing really well on the other hand. Like, Constellation Energy is a utility that is nuclear and has a lot of clean energy mixture also. That's the third best performing name in the S&P 500 this year. So there's a certain rotation away from the Magnificent Seven into the old school name and they seem to be the darling of that switch."", ""So there's other names like [INAUDIBLE] is doing great. They're a provider of clean energy infrastructure to a lot of people that participate. So there are two sides to that story. But fossil fuel is not going to go.

I mean, still holding up above that psychological $80-a-barrel level. Now, you do have the US dollar index, which is higher today.

Since then, the stock has gone on to rally almost 13%—not a bad return in just under three months. Following the latest upside surge that took GD stock to new highs, I’m not about to tone down my bullishness — not after the company’s latest $210 million army contract win amid rising threats from around the globe.', 'Add the still-modest valuation, a solid recent quarter (revenue grew by 8% to $11.67 billion), and aerospace tailwinds to the equation, and it’s no mystery why the Wall Street crowd still views GD stock as a Buy near its all-time high. CEO Phebe Novakovic also noted of the “significant growth in [the] backlog” late last year.', 'At writing, shares of GD trade at 23.43 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and just 19.4 times forward P/E, both of which are below that of the aerospace & defense industry averages of 36.1 and 20.2 times, respectively.

The\xa0average GD stock price target\xa0of $294.75 implies 4.8% upside potential.', 'If defense companies aren’t your cup of tea, perhaps a well-run railway company is. CSX and the rest of the railway stocks have recently awoken, with shares nearing all-time highs. Though only time will tell if this marks CSX’s multi-year breakout, I find the current valuation to be more than fair.', 'With a very generous quarterly dividend hike of 9% (by a penny to $0.12 per share) in the books, it may be time to hop aboard the dividend grower as shipping demand for a broad range of categories (chemicals, intermodal, and all the sort) returns to healthier levels. All things considered, I remain bullish on the stock.', 'The company’s investments to improve operational efficiencies will also allow CSX to take advantage of positively shifting industry dynamics. Perhaps the key takeaway from recent management commentary was that efficiency gains will not come at the cost of safety and service.', 'As the company taps into predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, my bet is that CSX can always find ways to make things even more efficient (and safer). Undoubtedly, generative AI gets so much buzz these days, but what about its predictive abilities? CSX and the industry at large are the beneficiaries as AI hits the rail tracks.', 'The company has been looking into IoT-enabled predictive maintenance for quite some time now. As AI advances, look for the firm’s predictive maintenance efforts to go into making its biggest gains to date.', 'CSX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months.

The stock is up more than 75% over the past year and 93% in the last two years. Undoubtedly, the motion and control system maker’s meteoric rise is due in large part to recoveries in the industries it serves. After staying mostly dormant for a few years following the pandemic-era surge, shares finally look to be waking up.', 'As the company’s aerospace systems segment continues to benefit from increased defense spending, PH stock seems like one of the breakout plays with room to move higher. Like Wall Street analysts, I’m staying bullish on the stock at today’s more-than-fair multiples.', 'Currently, the stock trades at a modest 27.7 times trailing P/E, below the specialty industrial machinery industry average of 31.5 times — a slight discount to the industry for an industrial that’s proven it may be worth more of a premium.', 'Late last year, Nathan Jones of Stifel remarked on “long-term tailwinds,” which he believes “support a favorable outlook.” Though shares went on to surpass Mr. Jones’ $500 price target (by around 10%), I still think some upgrades could be in order as the firm continues to execute under Jennifer Parmentier’s magnificent leadership.', 'PH stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average PH stock price target\xa0of $562.69 implies 1.4% upside potential.', 'The industrial scene is full of some pretty enticing breakout plays that aren’t all too expensive, at least compared to some of the tech-savvier plays out there. Of the trio, analysts currently see the most upside in GD stock (4.8%). The implied upside may look depressed today, but wait for analysts to revisit the drawing board.

Over the coming decades, the world needs to invest trillions of dollars to decarbonize the economy. That should power above-average growth for companies focused on those sectors in years to come.', ""I want to cash in on this megatrend. That's why I've been loading up on renewable-energy stocks. I recently bought a few more shares of NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP). Here's why I believe they could generate powerful total returns over the long term."", 'NextEra Energy Partners has hit a speed bump in recent years. Surging interest rates have driven up its cost of capital. Not only have borrowing costs risen, but its stock price has lost nearly 70% of its value from the peak in early 2022, driving its dividend yield up to 13%. That has made it more difficult to secure new funding at an attractive rate to refinance existing financing as it matures and obtain new capital for acquisitions. Because of that, the company has had to alter its strategy. ', 'It launched a two-part process to sell its natural gas assets. That will enable it to buy back the convertible-equity portfolio financing (CEPF) it used to make acquisitions. It has also cut its dividend-growth rate from 12% to 15% annually through 2026 down to 5% to 8% per year with a 6% target. The company can achieve that new target level through internally funded high-return, organic-growth projects, primarily repowering existing wind energy facilities. ', 'The company is making progress on its new strategy. Last year, it sold its Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio for $1.8 billion. That sale gave it the cash to retire most of its CEPFs through 2026. NextEra Energy Partners plans to sell its remaining gas-pipeline assets next year to address CEPF buyouts in 2026. ', ""If NextEra Energy can execute its plan, it could produce powerful total returns. It would pay a very lucrative and growing dividend. On top of that, it has significant stock-price appreciation potential as its share price recovers. While there's a high risk of a dividend cut due to its high payout ratio, a reduction could accelerate its recovery by enabling it to retain more cash to fund growth and strengthen its balance sheet. This high upside potential is why I continue loading up on its stock."", 'Brookfield Renewable has gotten caught up in the growth concerns weighing on NextEra Energy Partners. Its shares are more than 55% below their high in 2022. That pushed its dividend yield up over 6%. ', ""However, its issues were more a matter of timing than problems with financing. The company grew its funds from operations (FFO) by 7% per share last year despite rising rates and supply chain issues. That was slightly below its target of 10%, largely due to later-than-expected transaction closings in the fourth quarter. It also had one that didn't close because shareholders voted against the deal. "", 'That timing will turn into a tailwind this year, driving accelerated growth. Furthermore, despite the acquisition setback, the company sees abundant opportunities to deploy capital at attractive returns. Because of that, it expects to achieve its goal of growing its FFO per share by more than 10% annually through at least 2028. That will give it plenty of power to hit its target of increasing its dividend by 5% to 9% per year. ', ""Brookfield's dividend income and earnings growth alone could power total-annual returns in the mid-teens from here. Add in a recovery in its stock price, and the upside potential is even more significant."", 'NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable battled growth headwinds last year due to higher interest rates and other issues. However, they both have tremendous growth ahead due to the enormous amount of renewable-energy investment needed to decarbonize the economy. Because of that, they should recover and then some over the long term. That should give them the power to produce robust total returns, which is why I continue loading up on both stocks.

You think about geopolitical conflict, but on the other hand stronger dollar to consider. Looking at oil, just under 81 here. Where do you think we're headed, Bob, just in the near to intermediate term?"", ""BOB YAWGER: Well, on top of the geopolitics involved, we're two months away from driving season. So right now, the refineries in this country are going to start to ramp up. They're going to take a lot of crude oil through the refinery. This is a seasonal thing that happens every year."", ""We had a big pop in demand in the last two weeks in the month of March, which is very rare. And we had gasoline outpace crude oil to the upside. That's one of the things that sparked crude oil to the new high, the new multi-month high that we put in this week earlier in the week."", ""And this last storage report though that demand number sagged a little bit, but it's a very good sign that demand is very strong. It's at 9 million barrels a day. The all-time record is 10 million barrels a day and that was in the summertime in 2021."", ""JULIE HYMAN: I want to-- we'll go back to oil, but I do want to ask a little bit more about gasoline because so many drivers are paying so much attention to it. There are political implications of where gasoline goes.

We came out of COVID, the perception was that the US driver wanted to drive all over the place and burn through gasoline like there was no tomorrow.

Saudi's cut production and China eventually emerged and was the big demand engine that rallied the market to the moon. That's not going to happen anymore. It doesn't look like that's in the cards for anytime soon."", ""So they're not going to-- it's not going to be demand destruction, but they're going to stay at this level to maybe a couple of barrels higher.

An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.5% and 6.3% of all recommendations.', 'Check price target & stock forecast for PulteGroup here>>>While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it.

We've already seen growth in these companies' earnings thanks to sales of their products to customers developing AI projects. They and some of their peers continue to make great investments because growth in the AI market looks like it's just getting started."", ""But there's another way to invest in AI, and in many cases, these future AI winners haven't yet taken off -- so you can pick them up for a bargain today and likely benefit down the road. I'm talking about players in the AI-in-healthcare market -- one that, expanding at a 48% compound annual growth rate, is set to reach more than $148 billion by the end of the decade, according to a Markets and Markets report. Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang has even spoken of this market's potential, saying just this week that AI likely will have the most impact in healthcare."", 'How can you benefit? By buying shares of healthcare companies that are investing in AI to transform their offerings and streamline their processes. Here are two top stock picks to get in on right now.', ""Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is a medical device giant, selling a vast number of products across the areas of diabetes, cardiovascular, medical surgical, and neuroscience. And the company's growth opportunities are far from over -- it's won approval for 130 products in key geographies over the past year. All of this has helped Medtronic generally increase revenue and profit over time, and to further boost growth, the company recently took steps to streamline processes and divest slower-growth businesses to focus on high-growth areas."", 'So, the picture already looks bright. On top of this, Medtronic is taking steps to ensure its leadership in the potentially transformative technology of AI. The company has established an AI center of excellence to cost-effectively speed up the development of AI across its businesses. And Medtronic has won regulatory clearance for five AI products so far, from its GI Genius intelligent endoscopy tool to the MiniMed 780G diabetes management system. In the most recent quarter, Medtronic said it noted ""strong adoption"" of its AI-driven surgical planning solution for spine surgery.', 'All of this could be a key driver of growth for Medtronic in the years to come. Many of these tools, such as the surgical planning solution, are helping surgeons improve outcomes -- and this may lead to more and more users and significant revenue growth for Medtronic.', 'Today, Medtronic shares trade for only 16x forward earnings estimates, which looks like an absolute steal for a company set to lead in this billion-dollar growth market.', ""You probably know of Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) as the company that launched one of the world's best-selling healthcare products: the coronavirus vaccine. Moderna brought in billions of dollars in revenue from its vaccine in the earlier stages of the pandemic, and the vaccine could continue to generate significant recurrent revenue in the years to come."", 'But what you may not know is Moderna is also an AI company. The biotech has been using AI for quite some time -- and has made the technology central to the operations of its entire business. Back in 2014, Moderna used machine learning for mRNA design in order to design potential medicines in silico. A couple of years later, the company built an AI algorithm to create personalized neoantigen treatments for patients in clinical trials of the potential product.', ""More recently, Moderna developed an AI academy to train employees in AI so that the technology could help all departments gain in efficiency and precision. And Moderna has taken other steps to invest in the AI opportunity. The company last year opened a new office in Seattle to scale its use of AI and joined forces with International Business Machines (IBM) to explore quantum computing and generative AI for use in developing mRNA medicines. For example, Moderna is using IBM's MolFormer to better understand a molecule's properties -- and therefore develop better medicines faster."", ""All of this should help Moderna speed up the drug development process and become more efficient. This is likely to save time and money -- and potentially produce game-changing products. That could help earnings soar over the long run, making Moderna's valuation today -- at 8x forward earnings estimates -- look dirt cheap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medtronic wasn’t one of them.

On the original Boeing Max, the failure of a single sensor caused a flight-control system to point the nose of the plane down with great force — that happened before the deadly 2018 and 2019 Max crashes. It is a maxim in aviation that the failure of a single part should never be enough to bring down a plane.', 'In other cases, such as the door-plug panel that flew off the Alaska Airlines jet, it appears a mistake was made on the factory floor.', '“Anything that results in death is worse, but design is a lot harder to deal with because you have to locate the problem and fix it,"" said Aboulafia, the aerospace analyst. ""In the manufacturing process, the fix is incredibly easy – don’t do” whatever caused the flaw in the first place.', 'Manufacturing quality appears to be an issue in other incidents too.', 'Earlier this month, the FAA proposed ordering airlines to inspect wiring bundles around the spoilers on Max jets. The order was prompted by a report that chafing of electrical wires due to faulty installation caused an airliner to roll 30 degrees in less than a second on a 2021 flight.', 'Even little things matter. After a LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 flying from Australia to New Zealand this month went into a nosedive — it recovered — Boeing reminded airlines to inspect switches to motors that move pilot seats.

Unlike the brand-new Alaska jet that suffered the panel blowout, the United plane was 26 years old. Maintenance is up to the airline.', 'When a FedEx cargo plane landing last year in Austin, Texas, flew close over the top of a departing Southwest Airlines jet, it turned out that an air traffic controller had cleared both planes to use the same runway.', 'SEPARATING SERIOUS FROM ROUTINE', 'Aviation-industry officials say the most concerning events involve issues with flight controls, engines and structural integrity.', 'Other things such as cracked windshields and planes clipping each other at the airport rarely pose a safety threat.

The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for TE Connectivity is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For TE Connectivity, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Per the AUKUS agreement, Australia and the U.K. will operate a common submarine, with technology incorporated from all three nations, based on the U.K.’s next-generation design, which BAE Systems is leading.', 'To strengthen their defense capabilities, nations are rapidly increasing defense spending of late. In this context, investments in sea warfare capabilities involving submarines for both defense and offensive proposes have significantly gained traction. This should benefit BAE Systems, which builds the Astute Class and Dreadnought Class submarines.Since the AUKUS announcement in March 2023, BAE Systems has increased its U.K. submarine workforce to 13,500 with an aim to grow to around 17,000 to support the SSN-AUKUS submarine program. Notably, the SSN-AUKUS will be the largest and most powerful attack submarine for the Royal Navy.In October 2023, the U.K. Ministry of Defence awarded BAESY with 3.95 billion pounds for development work related to SSN-AUKUS through 2028. Built to replace the current Astute Class, the first U.K. submarine under the SSN-AUKUS program will be delivered in the late 2030s, and the first Australian submarine will follow in the early 2040s.Such developments should substantially benefit BAESY and boost order flows for its manufactured submarines, like the latest one. Such contract wins should bolster its revenue generation prospects in the Maritime segment, which comprised 22% of its total revenues in 2023.', 'Efficient submarines equipped with nuclear weapons add to a nation’s military capabilities and deter any potential nuclear attack in sea warfare missions. The advancement in submarine technology and its difficult-to-detect feature further contribute to its diverse advantages, thereby bolstering submarine demand worldwide.Per a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global submarine market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 4.3% during 2024-2028. This indicates ample growth opportunities for BAE Systems as it enjoys a lucrative position in the submarine space.Some other defense players that can gain from the expanding submarine market are General Dynamics GD, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.General Dynamics’ Electric Boat business unit is the prime contractor and leading shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs in the United States.

But early results in recent days from companies for their February-ending fiscal quarters have given us some idea of what this coming earnings season will show.', 'To that end, we tried to get some sense of the coming Tech sector results by looking at the Oracle and Adobe quarterly reports last week. This week, we want to focus on the consumer space by looking at the recent Nike NKE and Lululemon LULU results.', 'The market’s negative reaction to the Nike and Lululemon reports is a result of weak guidance from both companies.', 'As you can see in the chart below, which shows the one-year performance of the two stocks relative to the S&P 500 index, Nike has been dealing with company-specific issues for some time now. In fact, this is the second quarter in a row of disappointing guidance from the company.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Lululemon shares had been drifting ‘sideways-to-lower’ over the last few months, but the stock has otherwise been a big winner in recent years. Lulu’s aforementioned outperformance has not been without its share of detractors, with this negative surprise strengthening the naysayers’ conviction. The bearish argument is for shifting consumer preferences in the company’s core North American market, which still accounts for almost 80% of its total revenues. The bears acknowledge the company’s favorable international momentum but see a slowdown in the core home market as a far more significant headwind going forward.', 'In a way, the Nike and Lululemon reports don’t tell us much about the health of the consumer economy, which has long been seen as vulnerable due to cyclical and macroeconomic factors but continues to chug along.', 'That said, discretionary spending appears to be going more towards ‘experiential’ categories, like leisure and entertainment, instead of the type of ‘goods’ that Nike and Lululemon offer. It is reasonable to expect some moderation in consumer spending as well, which will be a net negative for consumer-facing operators like Lulu and Nike.', 'The Nike report and this week’s reports from Carnival CCL, Walgreens WBA, and others are for their respective fiscal quarters ending in February, which we and other research organizations count as part of the overall March-quarter or Q1 tally.

These factors included the post-COVID onset of inflationary pressures that compressed margins while the Fed’s extraordinary tightening moderated top-line growth.', 'A loud segment of the commentariat saw these unfavorable trends culminating in an economic recession and a material hit to the overall earnings picture. However, the U.S. economy has proved resilient, and the Fed’s extraordinary tightening has put us on track for a happy resolution to the inflation issue.', 'With the Fed now gearing up to start easing policy in the coming months, those extreme risks to the economy and corporate earnings have eased significantly.

We think they'll continue to raise guidance. Our estimates for next year are much higher than what they have."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and Sharon, I know you're positive on Lululemon as well. Do you agree with Zach that this is the typical Lulu playbook where they're just being overly conservative, or should investors be concerned about the slowing that Calvin MacDonald referred to?"", ""SHARON ZACKFIA: Yeah, and I think just to level set. Lululemon's trends in the US were very healthy through January. So we're talking about six weeks of a slightly slower trend."", ""February is usually not the tail that wags the dog in broader retail sales. And there are some inventory dynamics that they alluded to. Having better depth in smaller sizes, having more color, these are things they can fix. So it's not all macro."", ""And I do agree. I mean, this is a company that has a very long history of exceeding its initial guide. We think inventory adjustments. And the marketing activations that they're doing of which there will be three major ones this quarter are probably not fully contemplated as positive wild cards in this guidance. So we think there is room for this guidance to prove beatable."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right, two believers there in Lululemon. Zach, I want to turn to another name that did report did disappoint that'd be Nike. It's down about 7% in today's trade. You went to a hold on that name, Zach. Why a hold? What kept you from going to a buy?"", ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, so we had Nike as a so. We've kind of been back and forth sell and hold on Nike over the past two or three years. And we just think we're just concerned on where they're going to get their next level of growth."", ""Obviously, we love the brand. We know that it's a worldwide global brand. And one of the largest in apparel and footwear."", ""And we love the balance sheet. That's never been the issue. They buy back a lot of shares."", ""We're having a trouble figuring out where they're going to get their next level of growth. They saturated the US market. They saw a pop there during inflation."", ""So, obviously, as they raised prices, they saw a boost in revenues in the US. But the US is saturated. There's some areas of growth in Europe that they can kind of head towards, and you know, soccer, and some other sports but."", ""Outside of that, and then China's really been disappointing, too. So we're just going to wait and see here. We think there's got to be a better opportunity to buy Nike. And we'd rather wait and see, be patient, and hold here just because we're not sure where they're going to get growth from."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And Sharon, you don't cover Nike, but you do cover Under Armour. And we just got recently got bombshell news about the departure of CEO Stephanie Linnartz who hasn't been there very long. And Kevin Blank coming back. I believe you're still positive on the name. You still think investors should buy it. Why?"", 'SHARON ZACKFIA: I mean, I think Stephanie architected a big change in leadership over the last year. And 2/3 of the leadership is new. Kevin was involved to our understanding in those acquisitions of talent.', 'And we think, basically, the goal here is to steer the ship towards growth in the US. They have not had that sustainably for quite a while in terms of revenue. But also harvest more margin.', ""And so we've thought of this year as a margin of harvesting year as the new creative team and new leadership has the opportunity to really lay the foundation for better revenue growth in 2025. I think that all stays intact. But obviously, we'll have to hear what Kevin has to say on the next call."", ""But he has been there. He's been chair and brand chief.

Here's why they think buying these dirt-cheap stocks could be a brilliant move."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Axsome Therapeutics): It's not easy to value relatively small, unprofitable biotechs with few products. Though that description fits Axsome Therapeutics, there are plenty of clues that, in my view, make the company's market cap of $3.7 billion seem too low compared to its growth potential. Axsome Therapeutics has a rich, late-stage pipeline that should help transform its lineup in the next couple of years."", ""One of Axsome Therapeutics' two approved products, depression treatment Auvelity, is being tested in a phase 3 study to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) agitation. It has been extremely challenging to develop AD therapies of any type. And with an aging population, the number of AD patients, including those who suffer from agitation, will increase. There were 6.7 million AD patients in the U.S. last year, a number that could rise to 14 million by 2060 -- roughly 70% of them suffer from agitation."", ""Auvelity already aced one late-stage clinical trial in AD agitation, so things are looking good. But that's only the tip of the iceberg. With its deep pipeline, Axsome Therapeutics could have five marketed products by the end of next year. Even if these programs don't all pan out, there is substantial upside potential for Axsome Therapeutics."", 'And just as important, the company is setting up a strong foundation for the long term. Investors looking for a cheap biotech stock should look no further than Axsome Therapeutics.', 'David Jagielski (CRISPR Therapeutics): The gene-therapy market can be lucrative for investors to focus on. According to estimates from Grand View Research, the global gene-therapy market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% until the end of the decade. And if you want exposure to that market, a low-priced stock such as CRISPR Therapeutics can prove to be a brilliant move in the long run.', 'At less than a $6 billion valuation, CRISPR is a stock that looks cheap given the potential for the business to grow much larger. Now that it has an approved gene-therapy treatment in Casgevy, the company could be on the cusp of significant long-term growth. I think CRISPR Therapeutics has an incredible asset in its portfolio with Casgevy. The therapy, though priced at over $2 million, is still considered cost-effective according to healthcare analysts.', 'Although it has to share in the profits with its development partner, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the approval of Casgevy for treating sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia should open up significant growth opportunities for CRISPR, which in the process will also strengthen its financials. With limited revenue, CRISPR has posted a loss in three of the past four quarters. But as its financials improve, that should drive up its valuation in the future.', 'CRISPR Therapeutics has a game-changing therapy in Casgevy. With more therapies in its pipeline, this is a stock with loads of potential that investors may regret not buying at the current price.', ""Keith Speights (Pfizer): Pick any forward-looking valuation metric you want; Pfizer stock will probably look attractive. My personal favorite is the big drugmaker's super-low price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.27."", ""To be sure, Pfizer is cheap for a reason. Sales for the company's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral therapy Paxlovid continue to plunge. In addition, Pfizer faces a patent cliff over the next few years with multiple key drugs losing patent protection from competition."", 'However, I think this pharma stock will only be cheap for a season. Why? Pfizer should be able to deliver solid growth despite its challenges.', ""The company projects annual revenue of $25 billion by 2030 from new product launches that will wrap up by the middle of this year. That's enough to more than offset the estimated $17 billion in lost revenue from drugs with expiring patents."", ""Pfizer expects its business-development deals will add another $20 billion in new revenue by 2030. That doesn't seem farfetched with the acquisitions of Biohaven and Seagen already finalized. Overall, the company projects revenue will grow by a CAGR of around 10% between 2025 and 2030."", ""In the meantime, Pfizer offers a juicy dividend yield of over 6%. The stock doesn't have to deliver big gains for investors to enjoy great total returns.

The fact that a few of the blockbuster drugs on its shelves are heading for losses of exclusivity later this decade hasn't helped matters, either."", 'But this dark cloud has a silver lining. Pfizer may be transitioning into an exciting new growth phase, thanks to in-house product development and a key acquisition.', 'Last year was a record year for product approvals at Pfizer. The company won nine approvals for new molecular entities and additional nods to expand indications for already commercialized products. These efforts should bear fruit in the near term and down the road. Pfizer expects new approvals to result in $20 billion in potential revenue by 2030. This should more than compensate for the $17 billion the company expects to lose due to patent expirations of older products.', ""The other part of Pfizer's transition is the company's expanding focus on oncology through its acquisition of Seagen. With Seagen, Pfizer added four approved oncology products. This move gives it a series of near-term catalysts through the first half of next year, including four priority-indication launches, seven expected phase 3 data readouts, and six potential phase 3 study launches."", ""Pfizer predicts its oncology strategy will produce eight or more potential blockbusters by the end of the decade. So the bet on oncology is a big one and clearly could give Pfizer's earnings and share price a boost in the coming months and over the long haul."", ""Pfizer's stock price has dropped more than 30% over the past year, leaving it trading at 12x forward earnings estimates. Considering the company's wave of new products and the potential of Seagen -- bringing on board commercialized products, as well as research and development expertise -- Pfizer stock looks like a bargain at today's level."", 'Keith Speights (Moderna): The same COVID-19 headwinds that plagued Pfizer have also negatively impacted Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA). Over the last 12 months, share prices of the vaccine maker have plunged close to 30%. However, at long last, I think Moderna is again a magnificent stock to buy.', ""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of May 12, 2024, for its approval decision of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine mRNA-1345. I fully expect the FDA will give mRNA-1345 a thumbs-up. I also predict that the U.S. CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will recommend the RSV vaccine when it meets in late June."", ""Moderna will face Pfizer and GSK in the RSV market, and both have already won FDA approvals for their respective RSV vaccines, but there should be plenty of room for all three companies to win. However, Moderna could give the two bigger drugmakers a run for their money with its mRNA-1345's pre-filled syringes, which will save pharmacists and doctors time in administration."", 'Thanks largely to the anticipated commercial success of mRNA-1345, Moderna projects that it will return to organic sales growth in 2025. The company also expects to break even again in 2026.', ""The new RSV vaccine probably won't be Moderna's only growth driver over the next few years.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) still owns America's largest chain of retail pharmacies but its stock price has fallen hard in recent months.

At last count, there were about 9,000 retail locations across America plus a few thousand abroad."", ""Being America's largest chain of retail pharmacies isn't as much of an advantage as it used to be. In January, the company ended a 47-year streak of annual dividend payout raises by slashing its quarterly payout by 48% to $0.25 per share."", ""Shares of Walgreens are down about 79% from the all-time high they reached in 2015. On the surface, Walgreens' 4.7% dividend yield seems attractive now that the average dividend-paying stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index offers a 1.38% yield."", ""During Walgreens' fiscal 2024, which ends on Aug. 31, management expects adjusted earnings to land in a range between $3.20 and $3.50 per share. That's more than enough to meet a dividend commitment currently set at just $1.00 per share annually."", 'While its reduced dividend is well-funded now, significant growth in the years ahead could be a challenge. Walgreens does not own a pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, but its lead competitor in the retail pharmacy space, CVS Health, does. In a nutshell, PBMs decide which drugs our health plans cover and how much they cost.', ""For several years now, Walgreens has been building out a U.S. healthcare services segment, but it's still losing money. The segment posted a $1.7 billion operating loss during the 12 months that ended last August, then lost another $436 million during the three months that ended last November. I'd avoid Walgreens stock until the company shows investors it can execute an acquisition of a vertically integrated healthcare business."", ""Pfizer spun off its collection of post-market-exclusivity drugs in 2020, so these days, it's fully focused on selling and developing new medicines. The stock is down mainly because its COVID-19 product sales evaporated faster than expected."", 'Investors will be glad to learn that revenue excluding sales of its COVID-19 products grew 7% in 2023, and significant gains could be up ahead.', ""Sales of Pfizer's COVID-19 products fell faster than expected, but not before the company reinvested a great deal of the profits they generated. Last December, Pfizer acquired Seagen, a cancer drug developer that's expected to contribute $3.1 billion in revenue to Pfizer's top line this year."", ""Pfizer's dividend has risen 61.5% over the past decade, and investors can reasonably expect several more years of dividend growth. Management expects Seagen's revenue contribution to reach $10 billion by 2030."", ""Pfizer's confidence in Seagen's growth story is partly due to the Food and Drug Administration's approval of Padcev, a Seagen therapy, last December. Now, it's part of a chemo-free treatment option for newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients."", ""Pfizer offers a higher dividend yield than Walgreens right now, and I'd argue that it's a much better stock to buy and hold over the long run. Management feels the acquisition of Seagen doubled the company's oncology research and resources overnight. With this in mind, we can be fairly confident that Padcev won't be the only new blockbuster emerging from its pipeline in the years ahead."", 'Pfizer shares have been trading for just 12.4 times forward-looking earnings estimates, even though continued growth at a mid-single-digit percentage seems likely.

Could the drugmaker even be a trillion-dollar stock by 2035?', ""The math is straightforward for how Pfizer could reach a market cap of $1 trillion over the next 11 or so years.

However, let's walk through a hypothetical scenario where it could happen."", ""First, the hemorrhaging from Pfizer's COVID-19 sales would need to stop. This could be the easiest box to check off. I expect that 2024 will be a trough year for Pfizer's COVID-19 sales. The company hopes to win approval for a combination COVID-flu vaccine next year that just might turn things around."", 'Second, Pfizer would need its new products to blow past expectations. The good news on this front is that the drugmaker notched a record number of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals in 2023. It already has several rising stars in its lineup, notably including RSV vaccine Abrysvo and migraine therapy Nurtec.', 'What the company would really need, though, is a game-changing new therapy targeting a massive market. Two such markets that come to mind are obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Pfizer has a handful of pipeline candidates that could be big winners in these indications. It could also potentially make a strategic acquisition or two that adds best-of-breed therapies to its portfolio.', ""I intentionally left out a major obstacle in discussing a rosy scenario where Pfizer's market cap hits $1 trillion by 2035. The company faces a patent cliff for several of its top-selling drugs over the next few years."", 'Cancer drug Inlyta and autoimmune disease drug Xeljanz lose key U.S. patents in 2025. Patents for two other cancer drugs, Ibrance and Xtandi, expire in 2027. Blood thinner Eliquis will compete against generic rivals beginning in 2028. Several other products also lose exclusivity before 2035.', ""Granted, Pfizer thinks that its launches of new products and new indications for existing products will more than offset its anticipated revenue loss from the patent cliff. However, sales projections aren't always met. Pfizer could experience significant pipeline setbacks. Programs that it's counting on as future growth drivers could flop."", ""Gaining a big advantage in a huge market like obesity or NASH/MASH won't be easy, either. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk already have a big lead in the obesity market. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals has the NASH/MASH market to itself for now. Other companies could be on track to launch weight loss and NASH/MASH drugs in the next few years."", 'Some things are possible but not probable. The goal of Pfizer attaining a market cap of $1 trillion by 2035 belongs in this category. However, I think that the big pharma stock is a good pick for long-term investors regardless of whether or not it hits the trillion-dollar mark.', ""For one thing, Pfizer offers a fantastic dividend yield of more than 6%. The money the drugmaker uses to fund its dividend program won't help its market cap grow, but it will help shareholders make money."", ""I'm cautiously optimistic that Pfizer will be able to deliver solid (although not spectacular) share price growth over the next decade and beyond. The company certainly faces challenges, but it has a good strategy to address them with new product launches and strategic business development deals."", ""No one can know for sure exactly what Pfizer's future holds.

But there are still some companies that aren't joining the rally."", 'Take PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). It has completely fallen out of favor with the investment community. Its shares sit 78% below their peak price. Since the start of 2023, at a time when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have soared, PayPal has dropped 8% (as of March 22).', 'But if we look out over the long term, can this fintech stock turn things around and be a millionaire maker?', ""Perhaps one of the key reasons that PayPal's stock has taken such a beating is because of the company's stagnating user base. As of Dec. 31, there were 426 million active accounts on the platform. That figure is the same as it was 24 months ago. Anytime the customer base stops growing, it's understandable why investors start to worry."", ""This also points to the intense competition in the digital payments market. A rapidly expanding industry that has lots of long-term potential will definitely invite rivals. To PayPal's credit, it was one of the first major players in this sector, so it has developed a strong brand and scale that helps it defend against competitors."", ""The company's favorable position is illustrated by total payment volume (TPV) increasing 13% year over year to $1.5 trillion in 2023. That figure was 63% higher than the boom during 2020. Because PayPal operates a fee- and usage-based business model, more TPV is better, since it can lead to higher revenue."", ""And while the user base flatlines, it's extremely encouraging to see transactions per active account rise at a healthy clip. In the past 12 months, the average user transacted 58.7 times on the platform. That's up from 40.9 in 2020."", ""Alex Chriss, who was brought on as chief executive officer late last year, has already shown that he's focused on finding innovative ways to drive engagement. Trying to incorporate artificial intelligence is already a priority."", ""If you looked at PayPal's stock chart during the past three years, you would think that this business is on the verge of bankruptcy. But that's just not true."", ""Yes, PayPal carried $11.3 billion of long-term debt on its balance sheet at the end of last year. It also had $17.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. That's an obvious sign of a fiscally responsible organization."", 'The income statement is even more promising. PayPal generates double-digit percentage operating margins with impressive consistency. And it produces billions of dollars of free cash flow each year. This is a financially sound company that has long-term staying power, which minimizes risk.', ""There might be no better time to scoop up PayPal stock than right now. It trades at a dirt cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13. That's a huge discount to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. And it's a clear indication of the pessimism surrounding PayPal and its prospects."", ""There are, of course, two critical factors that can determine if a single stock can help you get to a $1 million position. If you're comfortable investing a bigger dollar amount initially, and you have a longer time horizon, then the odds are more stacked in your favor."", 'Nonetheless, it all depends on your bullish conviction.

Shares of the tech giant peaked in 2013, and it's taken until now for the stock to approach that all-time high."", ""IBM has undergone some major changes over the past decade. The company has divested, spun off, or otherwise exited a wide range of businesses, including semiconductor manufacturing, commodity server systems, and managed infrastructure services. It's also made some big acquisitions, notably the $34 billion purchase of Red Hat."", ""IBM's decadelong turnaround has been a slog, with progress occurring in fits and starts, and with setbacks around every corner. But the task of transforming a sprawling company that was caught flat-footed by the cloud computing revolution is now mostly complete. The stock has surged more than 50% over the past year, and that may be just the beginning as the tech giant's strategy bears fruit."", ""It's taken more than a decade, but IBM has homed in on a successful strategy for winning in the cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) markets. The company has built two platforms, each of which is bolstered by its vast consulting arm. The hybrid cloud platform has Red Hat software at its core, while the AI platform is built around watsonx."", 'The consulting business is one of IBM\'s key competitive advantages. While consulting services aren\'t nearly as profitable as software, both businesses feed into each other. IBM\'s customers need solutions, not just software. As IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said during the most recent earnings call, ""Consulting is a core driver of our value proposition for clients.""', ""The power of the consulting business can be clearly seen as IBM ramps up its generative AI business. In the fourth quarter of 2023, roughly two-thirds of bookings related to generative AI were consulting signings. Large enterprises looking to make use of generative AI, particularly those operating in heavily regulated industries, can't afford to throw caution to the wind. Guidance and expertise plus a capable software platform is a potent combination that will drive business for IBM's generative AI offerings."", ""A second key advantage is IBM's willingness to deeply integrate products and services from other companies into the solutions it delivers to clients. In the cloud computing segment, IBM has strategic partnerships with tech giants including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. The company has booked billions of dollars' worth of business through these partnerships, much of which likely would have not occurred if IBM didn't embrace competing platforms and products."", 'While demand for some types of services and software ebbs and flows with the state of the economy, IBM is seeing persistent demand for projects that aim to increase productivity and decrease costs. Both the hybrid cloud platform and the AI platform can deliver those goals to clients.', ""IBM's growth isn't earth-shattering, but the company's results should hold up well in most economic environments. IBM expects mid-single-digit revenue growth after adjusting for currency in 2024, along with free cash flow of about $12 billion. That's a solid gain from the $11.2 billion in free cash flow generated in 2023."", ""IBM stock has become pricier as it's rallied, but it's still not expensive. With a market capitalization of about $176 billion, the stock trades for less than 15 times expected free cash flow. IBM shares aren't the bargain they once were, but the valuation remains reasonable."", ""The past decade has been a painful ride for investors, but there's finally a light at the end of the tunnel.

There were likely a lot of wonderful high points to recall, but also some terrible lows. That's just how life works. In many cases, you have to get through the lows to experience the highs. Often, doing so involves some kind of personal change."", ""The same is true of companies, which are just organizations made up of people. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) is one such organization with decades to look back on and it recently proved (not for the first time) that it has what it takes to get through difficult periods so it can enjoy the (financial) benefits of successful change. Here's why this matters for IBM, and for all of the other companies you own."", ""Arie de Geus worked as an executive for integrated energy giant Shell from 1951 to 1980, effectively helping to create the company's long-term industry forecasts. At one point while working for Shell, however, he was asked to consider what attributes a company needed to ensure long-term survival. That doesn't mean the 20 or 30 years that a typical company exists. That's a drop in the bucket. Arie de Geus looked at companies that had existed in some form for 100 years or more."", 'He eventually wrote a book about his findings titled The Living Company: Habits for Survival in a Turbulent Business Environment. Without getting into too much detail, what de Geus found was that companies are, as noted in my introduction, groups of humans all working toward a goal. Companies that manage to survive for centuries tend to have a culture that is focused on company preservation over short-term earnings growth. In other words, companies that are willing to endure near-term pain so that they can change and adapt to the world around them tend to figure out a way to keep going.', ""This may sound simple, but it requires a particular workplace culture. And that culture has to be fostered year in and year out. IBM has just proven (again) that it has such a culture, even though Wall Street didn't seem to believe it could change -- despite historical evidence that it has been able to do just that several times."", ""IBM traces its history back to 1911. At its founding, it produced things like scales and clocks and eventually punch-card tabulating systems. As computers came on the scene to compete with its punch-card devices, the company shifted gears and started to produce the then-new computing devices. Eventually, however, making computers wasn't a great business either, and the company shifted more toward technology services, helping companies integrate technology into their businesses. Essentially, the company transitioned with the world around it. These were not simple changes; they required years of effort and a commitment to remaining relevant, in a business sense."", ""That very basic history brings the IBM story up to the point where Ginni Rometty was brought on as CEO. Rometty's tenure was not a particularly profitable one for investors, with the stock down around 30% over the span. And to be fair, she got IBM into a number of businesses lines that have since been exited in whole or in part, including healthcare AI and buying The Weather Channel."", 'But it would be short-sighted to think that Rometty hurt IBM, as investors clearly believed given the stock price decline. She sold off businesses that were no longer desirable to be in and added new businesses that were more attractive, including being an early adopter of AI, the purchase of Red Hat, and continued investment in quantum computing. Yes, there were missteps, but every CEO makes some mistakes. Overall, she set the foundation for her successor, Arvind Krishna.', 'Krishna exited more business segments and zeroed in on AI, cloud, and quantum computing. And with the restructuring of the company behind it (with much of the heavy lifting done by Rometty), financial results have started to turn higher now that IBM is refocused around higher-margin businesses with longer growth runways. As the chart above shows, trailing revenue and earnings appear to finally be on a sustainable march higher. Investors, meanwhile, have come back, rewarding IBM for what appears to be yet another successful business transition.', ""IBM's transition toward cloud, AI, and quantum computing wasn't any easier than its last business overhauls. Businesses were closed down or sold, people lost their jobs, and Wall Street doubted that the company could regain anything close to its former glory. But the company's recent financial results, including an 8% year-over-year increase in its consulting backlog, hints that 2024 could be another solid year for this technology giant."", 'Although IBM stock isn\'t as attractively priced as it was when the business turnaround was still in progress, it is the type of stock that a dividend investor can buy and hold for years. No, it won\'t always be at the top of its game, but history suggests that this ""living company"" knows what it takes to survive and thrive over the long term. Owning companies like that helps you build generational wealth. There are more of them out there than you might think, you just have to know what you are looking for. IBM is a good template for the search.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Let's analyze both the positive and negative factors surrounding this business and stock."", 'One compelling reason that investors might want to scoop up shares is that GM is experiencing solid business momentum. The company crushed Wall Street expectations in the fourth quarter of last year.

In 2023, GM generated $11.7 billion of automotive free cash flow. The leadership team used $11.1 billion to repurchase shares."", 'GM shares have had a good year thus far, but they remain 38% below their all-time high (as of March 18). And they are trading at a cheap valuation. The current price-to-earnings ratio of 5.6 is about half that of rival Ford. Value-focused investors might find this opportunity too hard to pass up.', ""It's easy to get caught up in the recent business momentum for GM, but I think the reasons to avoid the stock altogether make for a very compelling argument. Investors can't ignore that this is still an automaker. And this brings about some very unfavorable factors."", ""For starters, growth and profitability trends aren't anything for investors to get excited about. In the past 10 years, GM's revenue has increased at a compound annual rate of 1%. The global automotive industry is extremely mature. The number of passenger vehicles sold worldwide in 2022 was only 12% higher than the figure in 2010. This doesn't provide a favorable backdrop for most businesses in the sector."", ""And when it comes to profitability, the company's operating margin has averaged just 5.8% in the past five years. The business hasn't shown the ability to expand its margins over time. GM must make massive cash outlays in factories, labor, and car components, while competitors are doing the exact same thing. This isn't encouraging about the future direction of margins."", ""Investors need to be OK with the cyclicality of the industry. Consumers' willingness and ability to spend on new vehicles is heavily influenced by macroeconomic forces, most notably interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can discourage people from buying cars. GM has no control over what the Federal Reserve will do, adding risk and uncertainty."", ""Electric vehicles are an area where competition and macro headwinds are rearing their ugly heads. Management admits that growth here is slowing, even though they still have plans to boost manufacturing capacity to be able to produce more units in the future. This points to the fact that even as the industry is undergoing changes for a more sustainable future, GM can't escape the reality of being a carmaker. Demand isn't automatically going to pick up from historical norms."", ""In the last 10 years, GM shares have returned 53%, including dividends.

Over the last 5 years, Target has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.86%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend.

However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend.

And it isn't just the post-pandemic demand surge. In fact, cruise prices are about 20% higher than 2019 levels, according to an analyst from Truist Securities, and pricing for 2025 sailings is even higher."", 'However, cruises can still be a great way to travel, and there are some effective ways you can potentially save hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Here are four of the strategies I use when booking cruise vacations for my family that you can use as well.', 'While this isn\'t a set-in-stone rule, cruises are generally cheaper in off-peak times. And while the definition of ""peak"" times depends on who you ask, here\'s one rule of thumb: Cruises are generally much cheaper when kids are in school. The summer months, spring break, Thanksgiving week, and winter break are some of the busiest (and most expensive) times to cruise. But if you pick a time when it\'s not quite as easy for families to get away, it can save you a lot of money.', 'As a side note, using a third-party travel agent can be a great source for low-cost cruise options. Costco offers low-cost travel options, and its cruise bookings often come with perks like onboard credit.', ""If you're planning to buy a drink package, eat at a premium restaurant, add internet access, or book a shore excursion, all these items can be significantly cheaper if you book and pay ahead of time. On a Royal Caribbean cruise I've booked for later this year, the Deluxe Beverage Package costs 25% less if I buy it ahead of time versus on the ship. The premium restaurants are 10% to 20% less."", 'I could go on, but you get the idea. Prepaying can make your cruise much more affordable, plus it can allow you to budget for things a little at a time, instead of getting hit with one large credit card bill onboard.', 'When you book a stateroom on a cruise, you generally have two main ways to do it. You can choose the exact location of your room, or you can choose the category without a specific room assignment. In other words, you can book ""room 7614"" or you can book ""balcony stateroom guarantee.""', ""One big tip is that the latter option can be far cheaper. When I booked a recent cruise, choosing a balcony stateroom without a specific cabin number was more than $200 less per person than choosing an exact location. Sure, you won't have any say regarding where on the ship your room is located, but even if you're in a bit of an out-of-the-way location, nothing is that far on a cruise ship."", 'Many people think of cruises as being six to seven nights at a minimum, and this is certainly the most popular cruise duration. But you might be surprised at the abundance of three- and four-night itineraries that are available.', ""Royal Caribbean does a particularly great job with this, using some of its newest and largest ships for short cruises. For example, the Utopia of the Seas, Royal Caribbean's new mega-ship that launches in July, is exclusively sailing short itineraries from Port Canaveral (near Orlando). If you want to try cruising, a shorter cruise might fit into your budget -- and allow you to see if you like it before committing to spending a week or more at sea."", 'Even with the rising prices, taking a cruise can still be an excellent way to travel to several different destinations and enjoy a state-of-the-art floating resort for less than the cost of most land-based vacations. And if you use some of these suggestions, your first (or next) cruise can be more affordable than you think.', 'This credit card is not just good – it’s so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

Those two characteristics make it great for those seeking to collect passive income.', 'The REIT supports that dividend with a portfolio of income-producing retail properties. It focuses on owning properties net leased or ground leased to financially strong national and super-regional retailers resistant to disruption from e-commerce. It therefore collects very durable and stable rental income. It pays out about 75% of that income in dividends and uses the rest to help fund new acquisitions. Its steadily expanding portfolio has supplied it with the rising income to grow its dividend at a 6.1% annual rate over the last decade. With a strong balance sheet and long growth runway, Agree Realty should be able to continue increasing its dividend in the years ahead.

Clearway has already secured the funding and investments to deliver on that target.

On top of that, the company has several organic expansion projects under construction and in development to support the country's growing oil and gas production. Those projects will grow its cash flow as they come online. While the country is slowly transitioning to lower carbon energy, it will need fossil fuels for decades, which should give Oneok plenty of fuel to continue paying dividends. "", 'Vici Properties (NYSE: VICI) pays a 5.7% yielding dividend. The REIT focuses on gaming and experiential properties net leased to high-quality operators. That allows it to collect very stable rental income to support that payout.', 'The company has increased its dividend in all six years since its formation, including by 6.4% last September. Acquisitions are its main growth driver. It invested nearly $2 billion across various transactions last year, including its first international investments and several new experiential categories. It has continued to secure new investments this year, including funding the development of a Margaritaville Resort in Kansas City, which includes options to buy that resort and other experiential properties developed in the city by the operator. The company continues to extend its growth runway by expanding into new categories and developing new relationships with operators. Given its strong balance sheet and access to capital, Vici Properties should be able to continue expanding its portfolio and dividend for years to come. ', 'Verizon (NYSE: VZ) pays a 6.7% dividend yield.

It produces enough cash to invest in its network, pay a growing dividend, and strengthen its already solid balance sheet. The company's investments in 5G should help increase its cash flow in the coming years. Meanwhile, cost-cutting efforts (Verizon aims to shave $2 billion to $3 billion in operating costs by 2025 while reducing capital expenses by over $5 billion from its peak) and debt reduction will enable it to produce even more free cash flow. That will allow Verizon to continue increasing its dividend, which the telecom company has done for 17 straight years.

This represents a 38.72% change in EPS on a 15.76% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $29.78 per share on $4.66 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.82% and 10.86%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Deckers Outdoor may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well.

With its shares soaring past $900 recently, it wouldn't be surprising to see them reach $1,000 soon. This is extraordinary considering shares were trading at less than $50 just five years ago. The semiconductor specialist, which has been benefiting from the boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) as companies race to buy up its advanced AI chips, has become the ultimate Wall Street darling."", ""Nvidia shares undoubtedly deserved a big run-up given the chip-maker's stellar business performance. The tech company's revenue soared 126% year over year in fiscal 2024, fueled by a 217% increase in its data center revenue. But the degree of the stock's astronomical gains merits some skepticism."", ""To help illustrate the risks inherent in Nvidia shares today, I'd go as far as to say that even McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) may be a more attractive long-term investment from here. The boring and mature fast-food burger chain's more conservative valuation and predictable business arguably combine to make a superior value proposition for investors compared to Nvidia. While I recognize this may shock or even aggravate some Nvidia bulls, please hear me out. This isn't a pitch for Nvidia shareholders to sell but rather a reminder that not every stock is right for everyone."", ""On the surface, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio of 77 seems more than justified by the company's fundamentals. Not only did revenue more than double in fiscal 2024 but earnings per share soared 586%. With growth like this, investors may conclude that the company can easily grow into its stock's valuation."", ""But investors have to give some weight to the possibility of AI chip demand slowing in the future and Nvidia's operating profit margin taking a big hit. One main reason for the outsize gains in Nvidia's earnings compared to its revenue was a huge improvement in operating margin. Surging sales led to Nvidia's operating margin increasing from about 34% in fiscal 2023 to approximately 61% in fiscal 2024. While it's encouraging to see the company's operating margin increase, such a large boost in margin means there's a risk of some moderate or even significant reversion for the key profitability metric at some point in the future. If supply and demand for Nvidia's data center products become more balanced over time, for instance, unit sales growth could slow, chip prices could come down, and operating margin could compress all at the same time. There's a risk, therefore, that future circumstances could lead investors to be more hesitant about paying 77 times earnings for the stock."", ""Compare this to McDonald's, with its far more conservative price-to-earnings ratio of 24 and its more consistent operating margins. To its credit, the operating margin at McDonald's has expanded from 42% before COVID to 46% today. But given how much slower and smaller its operating margin expansion has been than Nvidia's, any reversion to the burger chain's pre-COVID operating margin levels would likely occur at a slow and manageable pace (manageable for both management and investors) and would have a much smaller negative impact on profits. McDonald's investors, therefore, would likely have plenty of time to react to the changing environment and they'd probably be compensated by the fast food king's long-standing dividend (currently yielding 2.3%) while they re-evaluate the stock's long-term prospects."", ""Further, most people would likely agree that the pace of disruption and change is much faster in semiconductors than it is in fast food -- particularly when comparing market leaders of both industries. To illustrate, look at the rise and fall of Intel stock, which reflects how the company's once-dominant industry leadership has been easily eroded away by competitors like Nvidia, Broadcom, and others. Long gone are the days of Intel's leadership. Over the last five years, Intel stock has declined 20% and Nvidia shares have risen more than 2,000%."", 'Meanwhile, McDonald\'s has easily sustained a leadership position as a global restaurant chain for decades. Not only has its stock increased more than 50% over the past five years while paying meaningful (and growing) quarterly dividends to shareholders the whole time, but the underlying business continues to grow rapidly. Today, its strong growth persists. Gobal comparable restaurant sales rose 9% year over year in 2023 and increased 30% since 2019. The company\'s scale, customer loyalty, and consistent service across its stores have created a wide and highly predictable ""moat"" for the business that keeps customers coming back and competitors at bay.', ""It's safe to say that McDonald's has an easier-to-predict business than Nvidia. The likelihood of a new competitor disrupting the burger chain is much lower than it is for a competition to make inroads on Nvidia's semiconductor leadership. Further, the ramifications of potential negative outcomes, like Nvidia giving up its big lead over competition or slowing sales, could be disastrous for the stock given the risk of significant margin compression and the growth stock's high valuation."", ""Don't get me wrong. I could be drastically underestimating Nvidia. Indeed, there's probably a high chance I am. However, history in the tech sector (particularly in the semiconductor industry) shows that there is a high level of unpredictability regarding how competitive dynamics can play out over time. For this reason, I firmly believe there's greater visibility into the business at McDonald's than Nvidia -- enough difference that I'd rather bet on McDonald's stock."", ""Sure, I would consider investing in Nvidia at the right price. But that price would have to be very attractive, leaving a meaningful margin of safety in my calculations about the company's potential future. In other words, I'd consider buying Nvidia stock if I believed it traded at a significant discount to my estimate of its fair value. But its current price is far above the levels I'd need to see it trade at before shares seemed to trade with a sufficient margin of safety."", ""This isn't to say that McDonald's stock will outperform Nvidia stock over the long haul. Instead, the point is that risk and reward go hand in hand. I'd argue that the potential reward investors can achieve from McDonald's stock relative to the underlying risk of owning it makes for an overall better value proposition than Nvidia stock's current risk-reward profile.One final point: investors should remember that they don't need to invest in every hot stock. It's OK to sit on the sidelines and not participate in an investment if it seems too risky to them. Every investor is different. I, for example, would rather choose a stock with less valuation risk and more visibility than Nvidia -- even if this means missing out on big potential gains. In the meantime, I'll sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show without judging those who have chosen to invest in Nvidia stock. Many people have higher risk tolerances than me and that's OK."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

That has led to worries of overvaluation amid its 249% gain over the last 12 months.', ""That could also be worrisome, given the recent history of another AI stock, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Ark Invest's Cathie Wood predicted a $2,000 per share price for Tesla by 2027 on anticipated demand for its self-driving platform. That forecast has occurred as falling demand for EVs and lower gross margins hamper its stock, which is down 30% in 2024."", ""Although Nvidia is not invincible, it has not shown any signs of slowing so far. Hence, before assuming that Nvidia will follow Tesla's lead, investors should consider these points."", ""Investors should remember that it has only been in recent years that investors viewed Nvidia and Tesla as potential competitors. Tesla was long seen as an automaker and a battery company, and even now, car sales make up most of the company's revenue."", ""However, as mentioned before, some analysts paid more attention to Tesla's self-driving platform. In this regard, Tesla has made an unusual and intriguing decision. Rather than turning to Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices for the chips to power the platform, Tesla developed AI chips, software, and robotics in-house."", 'Nvidia focuses more heavily on AI chips, primarily with data centers. Although automotive makes up a tiny fraction of its revenue, its product line includes three different chips tailored to driver assistance and full self-driving. Additionally, it offers software packages, including an operating system and neural network.', 'Nvidia credited Tesla with ""raising the bar."" One has to assume Tesla is the industry leader in this niche.

Still, with Nvidia's focus in the data center, it seems like it will perform regardless of whether it can develop a competitive advantage in the auto industry."", 'Not surprisingly, differing focal points have naturally led to divergent financial results.', ""In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), Nvidia's revenue of $61 billion surged 126% higher over the previous year, leading to a net income of $31 billion, a 581% yearly rise. Given such results, the massive gains in Nvidia stock seem less surprising."", ""In contrast, Tesla's lower margins may have weighed on Tesla's growth rate, at least in the near term. In 2023, revenue grew at an annual rate of 19% to $97 billion. That sounds promising until you consider that it delivered 38% more cars, meaning that gross margins fell from 26% to 18% during that time. Such results may dim the optimism about generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income, which rose 19% to $15 billion."", ""Despite Nvidia's strong financial performance, investors may not know what to make of the differing valuation metrics between the two companies."", ""Due to Nvidia's rising stock price, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio increased to about 37. This is a high level even for a company experiencing massive growth, but it likely reflects the excitement boosting the stock."", 'In contrast, Tesla currently sells at a P/S ratio of 6. This is not a record low for Tesla, as the sales multiple fell below 2 in 2019, right before the pandemic. Still, the P/S ratio is at its lowest level since 2020, and may lead some investors to question how much more downside there is for Tesla stock.', ""Nonetheless, despite Tesla's recent decline, the company trades at a forward P/E ratio of 54 as price cuts and slimmer gross margins begin to reduce profitability. Interestingly, Nvidia's rapid earnings growth translates into a forward P/E ratio of just 37. Such a multiple may imply that Nvidia may have an advantage despite recent gains."", 'Ultimately, investors should take both the P/S ratio and forward P/E ratio into account. However, since earnings tend to influence stock prices more directly, the metrics seem to place Nvidia in a more favorable light than Tesla.', 'Given current conditions, Nvidia stock will probably not decline to the same extent as Tesla anytime soon. Indeed, competition and an inevitable downturn in the chip industry could eventually undermine Nvidia. Still, with demand so strong for AI chips, such a scenario will likely not affect Nvidia in the foreseeable future.', ""Tesla faces a more uncertain path.

The company has muscled its way into the ""Magnificent Seven"" as it claims between 80% and 95% of the AI chip market.', 'However, Nvidia has also grown to a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 36, leading some to question whether that stock has become overvalued. Investors may want to look to other AI stocks, and two hold the potential to deliver outsize investor returns.', ""Investors may have to look no further than Nvidia's manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM). As the leading producer of the world's most advanced chips, TSMC makes Nvidia's success possible. Additionally, it is the leading manufacturer of chips for companies like Apple and AMD and has even attracted business from an emerging competitor in its industry, Intel."", 'As a result of this book of business, TSMC claimed 61% of the third-party foundry market in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to TrendForce.', ""Admittedly, amid geopolitical tensions on its home island of Taiwan, many investors, including Warren Buffett, have shown reluctance to invest in TSMC stock. Still, the company has mitigated this by building more fabs outside of Taiwan. Moreover, a source of geopolitical tension, China, depends on TSMC's chips, reducing the likelihood that it would put its supply chain at risk."", 'The company also seems to be recovering from the recent downturn in the chip market. Revenue of $69 billion fell 5% from year-ago levels. That led to a comprehensive net income of $27 billion, 22% less than year-ago levels.', 'Still, analysts forecast a 22% increase in revenue this year and a further 20% rise the following year. Such optimism took the stock price 55% higher over the last year.', 'Consequently, it now sells at a P/E ratio of about 26. While that is not low for this company, it compares favorably to earnings multiples for other chip stocks. And as demand from companies like Nvidia leads to rising production, TSMC stock will likely continue on its higher trajectory.', 'AI has also changed the game for another chip manufacturer, Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU). Micron produces the memory chips that help drive the AI revolution. Indeed, the memory chip industry has historically experienced more volatility than its counterparts that produce CPUs and GPUs. This led to no net gains in the stock between the mid 1990s and mid 2010s.', ""Nonetheless, the secular bull market in AI chips has changed the game for this stock, leading to a continuous rise in demand for memory chips. Consequently, the stock gained 140% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's total return and leading to Micron becoming a dividend stock."", ""In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Nov. 30, 2023), revenue of $4.7 billion rose 16% yearly. This signals a recovery in the memory market, as Micron's revenue declined 49% in fiscal 2023. Amid the struggles, the fiscal Q1 net loss was $1.2 billion, which improved from the $1.4 billion loss in the year-ago quarter."", 'Still, analyst forecasts call for a 34% increase in revenue in fiscal 2024 and a 42% rise in the following fiscal year. This could stoke a dramatic recovery that returns Micron to profitability as soon as this fiscal year.', 'Investors are optimistic, so much so that they have bid the P/S ratio to around 7, the highest sales multiple since the early 2000s, as the stock sells near all-time highs. As the AI revolution continues, the rising need for memory chips and increasing revenue likely means Micron stock will stay on an upward trajectory.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

L.OS launched in December with a goal of generating more than $540 million in freight-related revenue annually by 2030.', 'Bosch revealed RevX — developed in the U.S. for the U.S. — on Thursday at the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky, a target-rich environment for the industry stakeholders Bosch wants to attract. The goal is reducing the 35% empty miles that trucks run every year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics.', '“Think about what just a 5% reduction in empty miles would mean to the industry,” said Luke Hugel, who oversees Bosch Mobility Platform and Solutions, North America.', 'The subscription-based software as a service provides a view of more than 1.5 million available loads across five or more load boards including giants Uber Freight, DAT, TruckStop and up to 65,000 private brokerages whose loads typically are not publicly listed.', 'It could save 33%-50% of the time a dispatcher spends discovering and booking a load, Hugel told me.', 'That varies based on fleet size and complexity. A regional dispatcher focused on a group of trucks would make more queries than a dispatcher covering a dedicated route and seeking only loads for backhaul.', '“The reality is that there’s not one source that they use. Most dispatchers are looking across multiple load boards and multiple brokers,” Hugel said. “So the first value proposition of the RevX solution is to aggregate.', '“Instead of a dispatcher having eight tabs open, now they can see their search results in one spot,” Hugel said. RevX focuses on true revenue and costs of loads, leaving soft sides of the business like driver amenities to others to figure out. RevX features a single call or email for a dispatcher to win the load in a competitive marketplace.', 'Eventually, Bosch sees adding an AI-based load recommendation engine. That would free the dispatcher to focus on communication duties instead of searching for loads.', 'Load boards and brokers are eager to participate because it helps them get more loads covered while potentially growing their business. As a systems, software and hardware developer, Bosch more than knows the trucking business. In selecting and winning loads, it is a facilitator, not a competitor.', 'Why hasn’t this already been done?', '“You don’t have to look far to see some of the animosity between the load boards,” Hugel said, referring to negative comments over DAT’s intermittent service outages. “They’re very good at throwing shade when the other guy has a problem.

For example, driver app aggregator Platform Science and Geotab Marketplace’s fleet management software are not comparable.', '“This is a dispatcher’s tool,” Hugel said. “This is not a telematics-driven offering. You don’t need anything more than an ELD, which is required by law.”', 'RevX has the ability to spot and flag double-brokering, “one of the biggest nerve points in the industry,” Hugel said.', '“If a search comes back with the same load from multiple sources, it is showing where that original posting was, and you can see who’s posting. We spent a significant amount of time with that question because we feel there is value for the industry in doing this. No one wants to be associated with double-brokered loads.”', 'As for launching RevX, Bosch is offering it free for one month to anyone that wants it.', 'Nikola\xa0 celebrated the opening of its first Hyla high-pressure modular fueling station in Ontario, California, on Thursday. Alas, the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) and hydrogen fuel distributor faces other high-pressure matters.', 'Hydrogen fuel is pricey and scarce. Parts deliveries are slow, contributing to the trucks’ production costs outstripping what Nikola can charge for them by hundreds of thousands of dollars each.', 'With a stock price submerged below $1 a share since Dec. 5, Nikola faces delisting from the Nasdaq on July 17. But as devastating as that would be, it is also unlikely.', 'Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) has moves that could allow it to wrestle free. Most likely is a reverse stock split. The company could exchange a single share of stock for a multiple of existing shares. That would cosmetically push the price above a dollar, the threshold the Nasdaq requires for 30 consecutive days to stop the delisting clock. Another option is seeking a 180-day extension, which Nasdaq often allows.', 'An unexplained run-up — possibly a short squeeze — in Nikola shares last year saw them rise from 54 cents to $3.40 in two months. Whatever the reason, it was more than enough for Nasdaq to lift a delisting warning to Nikola it had issued in May. The share price has since tumbled, languishing between 60 and 70 cents since early March.', 'The Nasdaq doesn’t have to recognize a reverse split as meaningfully raising the price of the stock. But in many cases, it does. If Nikola shows significant Q1 revenue from selling Tre FCEVs, the exchange could consider it positive momentum, even with a lagging stock price.', 'Having issued new shares to raise cash, Nikola’s outstanding share count has swelled to more than a billion. Seeking shareholder approval to authorize more shares for the third time in three years might be cosmetically more palatable with fewer authorized shares. Adding to the existing authorization of 1.6 billion shares might not.', 'In any case, it’s a risky play.

MyBundle Co-Founder and CEO Jason Cohen joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how his business is helping consumers ""shave"" the cord to save money on streaming.', 'Cohen explains how the streaming ecosystem has become complicated: ""Think about steps. Step one is what is the right service for me? That\'s what we\'re doing today. If we fast forward all the way to the end goal, which we are doing with our broadband providers, is our broadband providers are giving not just discounts, but giving them away for free. Sign up for a gig, get $100 of streaming credits. Sign up or upgrade to a gig and we\'ll give you this service six months for free, so we\'re really working with the broadband industry to help make those offers a reality.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""JOSH LIPTON: You've heard of cutting the cord but our next guest is helping consumers shave the cord. MyBundle is helping package streaming and cable options for viewers in a constantly changing streaming landscape. For more, we have MyBundle co-founder and CEO, Jason Cohen. Jason, it's good to have you. Maybe to start, Jason, just for viewers who might not be familiar, just walk us through a little bit more about MyBundle. What do consumers turn to you for?"", 'JASON COHEN: Sure. No, Josh, first, thanks for having me. So we do a bunch of different things, which always makes this fun. The first thing we do is we help consumers, as you said, shave the cord, looking for an alternative to a cable or satellite TV package. We help them find the YouTube TVs, the Hulu Lives, the Slings, which one of them has the channels that they need, which makes it super easy to save a lot of money.', ""So for consumers, we help them do that we also go into finding the best package of streaming services for cord-cutters or cord-nevers, helping you find shows and movies across your services, talk about watch lists and what comes next. So that's how we're helping consumers really navigate this new very complicated streaming ecosystem. And then we partner, which I'm sure we'll get to, but we partner with the broadband industry and the streaming services themselves to really bring it all together and just make the ecosystem work better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Jason, do-- so do people get sort of a discount on any of the services when they're bundled together? I mean, that's something that the likes of Verizon are starting to offer here. Or is this more about tailoring it so people can get the stuff that they want to watch?"", ""JASON COHEN: Yeah, great question. So think about steps, like step one is, what is the right service for me? And that's what we're doing today. If we fast forward all the way to the end goal, which we're doing with our broadband providers, is our broadband providers are giving not just discounts, but giving them away for free. Sign up for a gig, get $100 of streaming credits. Sign up or upgrade to a gig, and we'll give you this service for six months for free. So we're really working with the broadband industry to help make those offers a reality."", ""You mentioned Verizon with their Plus Play. Think of it as Plus Play for the rest of the broadband industry. And there are about 3,000 internet providers out there. It's kind of crazy. And so that platform sitting between those broadband providers and the streaming services out there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And Jason, there's so many streaming services at this point, it's hard to keep track. I mean, do consumers-- do they want all these options? Is there demand there?"", ""JASON COHEN: Yeah. So we think-- from our studies and from other studies and from obviously talking to consumers, it's not that they want less. It just needs to be simple. I say you don't need consolidation in the streaming industry. You do need aggregation. So if it's easy for consumers to bundle if Julie, like you mentioned, if when you-- the more you bundle, the more you save, which is where we think this is all heading, ultimately consumers don't want less. They just need somebody to help them figure it all out and manage it all."", 'JULIE HYMAN: How do you guys make money, Jason? Do you-- do you charge a fee? Do you collect fees from these broadband companies? How does that work?', ""JASON COHEN: Yeah. So again, great question. So a couple of ways. So what we do is basically the broadband providers pay us what we like to think very low monthly SaaS fee. But what this is really also about is actually helping the media companies, the streaming services navigate this world as well. As you listen to their earnings calls, they're all talking about bundling and finding new customers and retaining those customers. And how do they do it?"", 'Well, what MyBundle is doing is aggregating the broadband industry for each streaming service so they only have to come to MyBundle for one integration and get access to we have now over 220 broadband providers with 13 million internet customers that are my bundle partners. And so the second part is getting paid by the streaming services the same way they pay those little companies like Google or Apple or Amazon.', ""The difference is we're not big tech, we're not trying to eat their lunch. We're a little tech, and we're saying we're here to help. And so we earn that revenue from the streaming service and then share that with the broadband provider. And so we're really-- everything MyBundle does it's all about creating those win-win-wins for our consumers, our broadband partners, and the streaming services to make this whole streaming ecosystem a lot simpler."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And you know, Jason, there's a new sports streaming service coming. Disney, Fox, and Warner Brothers teaming up. Just interested to get your thoughts on there. What do you think the reception is going to be like? Is the demand there for that?"", ""JASON COHEN: Yeah. So we know one of the things with our tool is, right, we know what channels people pick and what they're interested. And there definitely are consumers that are more into sports versus not. Just quickly, like before starting MyBundle, I was actually in the finance world. I watched you guys back in my old job at a hedge fund, investing in media and telecom."", ""And the reason we started MyBundle was specifically because the thought was this is all going to fragment with the internet. The internet's going to come, we're going to go from a closed system to an open ecosystem. The middle is going to be messy. We're right now right square in the middle, where there's going to be more services and more choice and more options. And what we're all about is matching up the people that want those channels and don't need the other channels and the idea of helping people find that."", ""And so we do think there is demand. There's a lot more demand for streaming. We think there's going to be a lot more shifting over from traditional facilities-based TV over to streaming. And specifically, whether it's this and then ESPN direct-to-consumer, which will come the next-- which is a skinnier skinny version of that, we think there's going to be more and more options. And that's not a bad thing. But it's not a bad thing as long as a company like MyBundle or some of the other companies like the large, large cable providers or, like you said, Verizon, somebody needs to be there to help the consumer put Humpty Dumpty back together again."", ""And we think Humpty Dumpty, not to kill that metaphor, but it's going to look a lot better. And the end result of this is way, way better for consumers than how it used to be when they have that little bit of help."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Jason, thanks so much. Appreciate it.', 'JASON COHEN: Thank you so much for having me.']"

However, many stocks offer much higher yields, with several presently paying dividends yielding 5% or more. Here are five stocks with payouts above that level that should generate income for their investors for years to come."", 'Agree Realty (NYSE: ADC) yields 5.3% these days. Even better, the real estate investment trust (REIT) pays a monthly dividend. Those two characteristics make it great for those seeking to collect passive income.', 'The REIT supports that dividend with a portfolio of income-producing retail properties. It focuses on owning properties net leased or ground leased to financially strong national and super-regional retailers resistant to disruption from e-commerce. It therefore collects very durable and stable rental income. It pays out about 75% of that income in dividends and uses the rest to help fund new acquisitions. Its steadily expanding portfolio has supplied it with the rising income to grow its dividend at a 6.1% annual rate over the last decade. With a strong balance sheet and long growth runway, Agree Realty should be able to continue increasing its dividend in the years ahead. ', 'Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A) offers a 7.7% dividend yield. The clean power producer backs that payout with very stable income generated by selling electricity to utilities and large corporate buyers under long-term contracts.', ""The company expects to increase its already attractive payout by 5% to 8% annually over the long term, with growth likely toward the upper end through at least 2026. Clearway has already secured the funding and investments to deliver on that target. It sold its thermal assets in 2022, which gave it the cash to invest in several high-return renewable energy acquisitions. Those deals will close over the next few years as the projects enter commercial service. Meanwhile, Clearway should have ample power to continue growing its portfolio and payout in the future, given the country's massive need for new renewable energy investment. "", ""Oneok's (NYSE: OKE) dividend yields 5.9%. The pipeline giant supports that payout with steady cash flow backed by long-term, fee-based contracts. The company aims to increase that payout by 3% to 4% annually. "", ""Acquisitions and organic expansion projects will fuel that growth. Oneok closed its needle-moving acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners last year, which will help fuel double-digit earnings growth this year. It has the financial flexibility to make more deals as compelling opportunities arise. On top of that, the company has several organic expansion projects under construction and in development to support the country's growing oil and gas production. Those projects will grow its cash flow as they come online.

Additionally, Zackfia names Under Armour (UA, UAA) as another Buy recommendation, highlighting the brand\'s leadership transition, which she believes will enable the company to ""harvest more margin.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""JOSH LIPTON: In a post COVID world, athleisure is having a moment the trend soaring into a full-blown industry with roughly 200 new brands hitting the market since COVID.

Welcome both of you to the show."", ""And Zach, maybe I'll start with you. And we can start just kind of big picture. Zach, you know this sector very well. You know the names."", ""I'm just interested kind of broadly, Zach. What are you seeing? How healthy and resilient does this sector look? What are the underlying demand trends look like to you?"", ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, thanks for having me. So, in the US, you're starting to see a little bit of weakening. And that's kind of been happening over the last 12 months as the US consumer kind of deals with a lot of different headwinds."", ""So in the US, you're seeing a little bit of a weakening. But nothing scary. It's not the apocalypse. The world's not ending."", ""But you're seeing a softening there. And then internationally, it's kind of company by company. Some companies are pretty much able to grow at will while others have kind of struggled."", ""So you've seen that with Lululemon and Nike after hours yesterday. Lululemon was able to grow 78% in China, which is pretty incredible. And then Nike only had 6% growth."", ""So Europe was a little weak for Nike. But you know, Lululemon doesn't really talk much about other markets outside of China other than just their international market. But yeah, I mean, we think it's kind of a win or loser market."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Sharon, let's get your take on this, too. Where we are in the consumer spending spectrum and how willing, in particular, I think US consumers are to spend on athleisure right now?"", ""SHARON ZACKFIA: Yeah, I mean, I think in the broader context, we continue to see consumers shift to spending on more experiences versus goods. Athleisure is not immune to that. But if you look Athleisure in the context of the broader apparel category, the trends look very good relative to the broader space. So we're seeing resiliency within Athleisure that I think is different than what we see in broader apparel."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And Zack, let's dig into some specific names here. Talk Lululemon. They reported. Obviously, Zach, investors were disappointed."", 'But you go from buy to strong buy on the ratings, Zach. How come? Walk us through that.', ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, so in the last five years or so, you've only had a couple of opportunities to buy Lululemon at under 30 times forward earnings. And right now, they're trading roughly at 28 times. And so we see that opportunity for a great company."", ""Lulus operating margins continue to trend higher. Obviously, they've got growth in China and internationally. They're seeing a little bit of softening in the US. And that kind of I think is where shares slid last night was once CEO came on and said that they were seeing weakness here."", 'But we think this is a great buying opportunity. And we love the company. We think the company is one of those, they guide really conservative usually. And then they raised throughout the year.', ""So we think this is a starting point. We think they'll continue to raise guidance. Our estimates for next year are much higher than what they have."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and Sharon, I know you're positive on Lululemon as well. Do you agree with Zach that this is the typical Lulu playbook where they're just being overly conservative, or should investors be concerned about the slowing that Calvin MacDonald referred to?"", ""SHARON ZACKFIA: Yeah, and I think just to level set. Lululemon's trends in the US were very healthy through January. So we're talking about six weeks of a slightly slower trend."", ""February is usually not the tail that wags the dog in broader retail sales. And there are some inventory dynamics that they alluded to. Having better depth in smaller sizes, having more color, these are things they can fix. So it's not all macro."", ""And I do agree. I mean, this is a company that has a very long history of exceeding its initial guide. We think inventory adjustments. And the marketing activations that they're doing of which there will be three major ones this quarter are probably not fully contemplated as positive wild cards in this guidance. So we think there is room for this guidance to prove beatable."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right, two believers there in Lululemon. Zach, I want to turn to another name that did report did disappoint that'd be Nike. It's down about 7% in today's trade. You went to a hold on that name, Zach. Why a hold? What kept you from going to a buy?"", ""ZACHARY WARRING: Yeah, so we had Nike as a so. We've kind of been back and forth sell and hold on Nike over the past two or three years. And we just think we're just concerned on where they're going to get their next level of growth."", ""Obviously, we love the brand. We know that it's a worldwide global brand. And one of the largest in apparel and footwear."", ""And we love the balance sheet. That's never been the issue. They buy back a lot of shares."", ""We're having a trouble figuring out where they're going to get their next level of growth. They saturated the US market. They saw a pop there during inflation."", ""So, obviously, as they raised prices, they saw a boost in revenues in the US. But the US is saturated. There's some areas of growth in Europe that they can kind of head towards, and you know, soccer, and some other sports but."", ""Outside of that, and then China's really been disappointing, too. So we're just going to wait and see here. We think there's got to be a better opportunity to buy Nike. And we'd rather wait and see, be patient, and hold here just because we're not sure where they're going to get growth from."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And Sharon, you don't cover Nike, but you do cover Under Armour. And we just got recently got bombshell news about the departure of CEO Stephanie Linnartz who hasn't been there very long. And Kevin Blank coming back. I believe you're still positive on the name. You still think investors should buy it. Why?"", 'SHARON ZACKFIA: I mean, I think Stephanie architected a big change in leadership over the last year. And 2/3 of the leadership is new. Kevin was involved to our understanding in those acquisitions of talent.', 'And we think, basically, the goal here is to steer the ship towards growth in the US. They have not had that sustainably for quite a while in terms of revenue. But also harvest more margin.', ""And so we've thought of this year as a margin of harvesting year as the new creative team and new leadership has the opportunity to really lay the foundation for better revenue growth in 2025. I think that all stays intact. But obviously, we'll have to hear what Kevin has to say on the next call."", ""But he has been there. He's been chair and brand chief.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", ""We can see that Devon Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Devon Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Devon Energy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding.

There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count.

However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', ""Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Devon Energy Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$207m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

Whitfield now thinks that shares of the exploration and production company could rise to $65 (down from $75) over the next 12 months or so. That lowered price target represents a 34% upside from Friday's closing price."", ""Despite Whitfield's reduced estimate, energy investors may still want to power their portfolios with this leading upstream energy stock."", ""According to Thefly.com, Whitfield's downgrade is a reaction to Devon Energy's fourth quarter 2023 financial results and the company's 2024 outlook. In Q4 2023, Devon Energy reported revenue of $4.15 billion, representing a 3.6% year-over-year decline. Devon Energy projects daily production of 640,000 to 660,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). At the midpoint of guidance (daily production of 650,000 BOE), there would be a decline from the daily production of 658,000 BOE reported in 2023."", ""While Devon may face a dip in production, there are valid reasons why the company is worthy of investors' buy lists. For one, Devon is generous with its dividend, which currently provides a forward yield of 5% and is a product of the company's innovative fixed-plus-variable dividend framework. Skeptics may question the high-yield payout, but the dividend is clearly sustained by the company's ample free cash flow generation."", ""Additionally, the company is operating from a position of financial strength. As of the end of 2023, Devon had an investment grade balance sheet as rated by Moody's and S&P Global Ratings.

The company has muscled its way into the ""Magnificent Seven"" as it claims between 80% and 95% of the AI chip market.', 'However, Nvidia has also grown to a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 36, leading some to question whether that stock has become overvalued. Investors may want to look to other AI stocks, and two hold the potential to deliver outsize investor returns.', ""Investors may have to look no further than Nvidia's manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM). As the leading producer of the world's most advanced chips, TSMC makes Nvidia's success possible. Additionally, it is the leading manufacturer of chips for companies like Apple and AMD and has even attracted business from an emerging competitor in its industry, Intel."", 'As a result of this book of business, TSMC claimed 61% of the third-party foundry market in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to TrendForce.', ""Admittedly, amid geopolitical tensions on its home island of Taiwan, many investors, including Warren Buffett, have shown reluctance to invest in TSMC stock. Still, the company has mitigated this by building more fabs outside of Taiwan. Moreover, a source of geopolitical tension, China, depends on TSMC's chips, reducing the likelihood that it would put its supply chain at risk."", 'The company also seems to be recovering from the recent downturn in the chip market. Revenue of $69 billion fell 5% from year-ago levels. That led to a comprehensive net income of $27 billion, 22% less than year-ago levels.', 'Still, analysts forecast a 22% increase in revenue this year and a further 20% rise the following year. Such optimism took the stock price 55% higher over the last year.', 'Consequently, it now sells at a P/E ratio of about 26. While that is not low for this company, it compares favorably to earnings multiples for other chip stocks. And as demand from companies like Nvidia leads to rising production, TSMC stock will likely continue on its higher trajectory.', 'AI has also changed the game for another chip manufacturer, Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU). Micron produces the memory chips that help drive the AI revolution. Indeed, the memory chip industry has historically experienced more volatility than its counterparts that produce CPUs and GPUs. This led to no net gains in the stock between the mid 1990s and mid 2010s.', ""Nonetheless, the secular bull market in AI chips has changed the game for this stock, leading to a continuous rise in demand for memory chips. Consequently, the stock gained 140% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's total return and leading to Micron becoming a dividend stock."", ""In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Nov. 30, 2023), revenue of $4.7 billion rose 16% yearly. This signals a recovery in the memory market, as Micron's revenue declined 49% in fiscal 2023. Amid the struggles, the fiscal Q1 net loss was $1.2 billion, which improved from the $1.4 billion loss in the year-ago quarter."", 'Still, analyst forecasts call for a 34% increase in revenue in fiscal 2024 and a 42% rise in the following fiscal year. This could stoke a dramatic recovery that returns Micron to profitability as soon as this fiscal year.', 'Investors are optimistic, so much so that they have bid the P/S ratio to around 7, the highest sales multiple since the early 2000s, as the stock sells near all-time highs. As the AI revolution continues, the rising need for memory chips and increasing revenue likely means Micron stock will stay on an upward trajectory.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

The company is benefiting from a favorable travel demand environment, owing to growing demand for global leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends remains a major tailwind.Solid momentum in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth. Furthermore, strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is a major positive. Also, strong momentum across the merchant, and advertising and other businesses are other positives.Additionally, growing alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are tailwinds for the company. However, the declining trend in agency bookings is negatively affecting its top-line growth.

The first nine months of fiscal 2023 results show a rise in loan and deposit balances and fees and commissions, while net interest income (NII) declined.A large deposit balance from a broad customer base boosts its liquidity position and aid its inorganic growth. MUFG’s asset management strategy aims to enhance its investment capabilities in alternative investment and credit space. Also, the company’s capital strength aids its capital distribution activities.Yet, amid Japan’s low interest rate policy, MUFG’s top-line growth will likely continue to be hurt.

The company’s better-than-expected second-quarter performance reflects gains from improved market conditions, strong sales executions and double-digit growth across multiple business units.The positive impact of inventory improvement in the data center, as well as stabilization in other markets, such as automotive, industrial and others, have also contributed to its results. It anticipates the pricing of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and NAND chips will keep increasing next year, hence improving its revenues.The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI server causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply.

With its shares soaring past $900 recently, it wouldn't be surprising to see them reach $1,000 soon. This is extraordinary considering shares were trading at less than $50 just five years ago. The semiconductor specialist, which has been benefiting from the boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) as companies race to buy up its advanced AI chips, has become the ultimate Wall Street darling."", ""Nvidia shares undoubtedly deserved a big run-up given the chip-maker's stellar business performance. The tech company's revenue soared 126% year over year in fiscal 2024, fueled by a 217% increase in its data center revenue. But the degree of the stock's astronomical gains merits some skepticism."", ""To help illustrate the risks inherent in Nvidia shares today, I'd go as far as to say that even McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) may be a more attractive long-term investment from here. The boring and mature fast-food burger chain's more conservative valuation and predictable business arguably combine to make a superior value proposition for investors compared to Nvidia. While I recognize this may shock or even aggravate some Nvidia bulls, please hear me out. This isn't a pitch for Nvidia shareholders to sell but rather a reminder that not every stock is right for everyone."", ""On the surface, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio of 77 seems more than justified by the company's fundamentals. Not only did revenue more than double in fiscal 2024 but earnings per share soared 586%. With growth like this, investors may conclude that the company can easily grow into its stock's valuation."", ""But investors have to give some weight to the possibility of AI chip demand slowing in the future and Nvidia's operating profit margin taking a big hit. One main reason for the outsize gains in Nvidia's earnings compared to its revenue was a huge improvement in operating margin. Surging sales led to Nvidia's operating margin increasing from about 34% in fiscal 2023 to approximately 61% in fiscal 2024. While it's encouraging to see the company's operating margin increase, such a large boost in margin means there's a risk of some moderate or even significant reversion for the key profitability metric at some point in the future. If supply and demand for Nvidia's data center products become more balanced over time, for instance, unit sales growth could slow, chip prices could come down, and operating margin could compress all at the same time. There's a risk, therefore, that future circumstances could lead investors to be more hesitant about paying 77 times earnings for the stock."", ""Compare this to McDonald's, with its far more conservative price-to-earnings ratio of 24 and its more consistent operating margins. To its credit, the operating margin at McDonald's has expanded from 42% before COVID to 46% today. But given how much slower and smaller its operating margin expansion has been than Nvidia's, any reversion to the burger chain's pre-COVID operating margin levels would likely occur at a slow and manageable pace (manageable for both management and investors) and would have a much smaller negative impact on profits. McDonald's investors, therefore, would likely have plenty of time to react to the changing environment and they'd probably be compensated by the fast food king's long-standing dividend (currently yielding 2.3%) while they re-evaluate the stock's long-term prospects."", ""Further, most people would likely agree that the pace of disruption and change is much faster in semiconductors than it is in fast food -- particularly when comparing market leaders of both industries. To illustrate, look at the rise and fall of Intel stock, which reflects how the company's once-dominant industry leadership has been easily eroded away by competitors like Nvidia, Broadcom, and others. Long gone are the days of Intel's leadership. Over the last five years, Intel stock has declined 20% and Nvidia shares have risen more than 2,000%."", 'Meanwhile, McDonald\'s has easily sustained a leadership position as a global restaurant chain for decades. Not only has its stock increased more than 50% over the past five years while paying meaningful (and growing) quarterly dividends to shareholders the whole time, but the underlying business continues to grow rapidly. Today, its strong growth persists. Gobal comparable restaurant sales rose 9% year over year in 2023 and increased 30% since 2019. The company\'s scale, customer loyalty, and consistent service across its stores have created a wide and highly predictable ""moat"" for the business that keeps customers coming back and competitors at bay.', ""It's safe to say that McDonald's has an easier-to-predict business than Nvidia. The likelihood of a new competitor disrupting the burger chain is much lower than it is for a competition to make inroads on Nvidia's semiconductor leadership. Further, the ramifications of potential negative outcomes, like Nvidia giving up its big lead over competition or slowing sales, could be disastrous for the stock given the risk of significant margin compression and the growth stock's high valuation."", ""Don't get me wrong. I could be drastically underestimating Nvidia. Indeed, there's probably a high chance I am. However, history in the tech sector (particularly in the semiconductor industry) shows that there is a high level of unpredictability regarding how competitive dynamics can play out over time. For this reason, I firmly believe there's greater visibility into the business at McDonald's than Nvidia -- enough difference that I'd rather bet on McDonald's stock."", ""Sure, I would consider investing in Nvidia at the right price. But that price would have to be very attractive, leaving a meaningful margin of safety in my calculations about the company's potential future. In other words, I'd consider buying Nvidia stock if I believed it traded at a significant discount to my estimate of its fair value. But its current price is far above the levels I'd need to see it trade at before shares seemed to trade with a sufficient margin of safety."", ""This isn't to say that McDonald's stock will outperform Nvidia stock over the long haul. Instead, the point is that risk and reward go hand in hand. I'd argue that the potential reward investors can achieve from McDonald's stock relative to the underlying risk of owning it makes for an overall better value proposition than Nvidia stock's current risk-reward profile.One final point: investors should remember that they don't need to invest in every hot stock. It's OK to sit on the sidelines and not participate in an investment if it seems too risky to them. Every investor is different. I, for example, would rather choose a stock with less valuation risk and more visibility than Nvidia -- even if this means missing out on big potential gains. In the meantime, I'll sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show without judging those who have chosen to invest in Nvidia stock. Many people have higher risk tolerances than me and that's OK."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.

The company has employed 48% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", ""To sum it up, United Parcel Service has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return.

', 'In a Thursday letter, Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG, the Consumer Federation of America and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition expressed concern about the implications of the deal and called on regulators “to commit to a more transparent process that enables the public to fully participate in the consideration of this important merger review.” ', 'Meanwhile, Capital One is moving ahead on the formal application process:\xa0The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is in receipt of an application from Capital One to acquire Discover, a spokesperson said Thursday.', 'The proposed combination,\xa0in which the fourth-largest credit card issuer would acquire the sixth-largest issuer, “warrants careful consideration,” the organizations wrote in their letter to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu and Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s antitrust division.', 'Announced last month, the tie-up “would substantially increase the combined firm’s horizontal and vertical market power and ability to use that market power to disadvantage depositors, customers, merchants and communities,” the advocacy groups asserted.', 'The deal would make McLean, Virginia-based Capital One the largest credit card issuer in the U.S., eclipsing JPMorgan Chase. With Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover, Capital One would gain ownership of the smallest of the four major card networks. The tie-up “presents multiple, significant concerns under federal antitrust and banking statutes that justify a careful and thorough review by banking and antitrust agencies,” the letter’s authors wrote.', 'The advocacy organizations urged the Fed, OCC and Kanter to publicly commit to a thorough and deliberative process, including barring streamlined application or expedited review of the proposed merger; extending the public comment period to at least 60 days; and holding public hearings in the largest lending markets where Capital One branches and Discover offices are located.\xa0', 'Incidentally, Hsu in January suggested putting a halt to expedited bank merger procedures. And another regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., on Thursday proposed more scrutiny of large bank mergers with regard to anti-money laundering compliance,\xa0financial stability and community impact.\xa0', 'The letter’s signers asked regulators to disclose to the public the content of any pre-filing meetings or discussions with the merging parties; evaluate the proposed merger under 2023 merger guidelines; and make the competitive factors report available to the public.\xa0', '“The proposed merger represents the exact kind of transaction involving ‘novel, precedent-setting, or highly complex or sensitive issues’ that the Comptroller has noted requires careful deliberation,” the organizations contended.\xa0', 'The proposed acquisition has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers, too: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and 12 other congressional Democrats have called on regulators to block the deal, as have Rep. Maxine Waters, D-CA and Sen. Josh Hawley, R MO.\xa0', 'Attorneys have said the deal will face a heavy-handed review, and it’s almost certain to draw the attention of the DOJ, which will look at the market concentration impact of the combination.', 'Capital One executives have said they expect the deal to close late this year or early next. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank has said he believes the deal is “well-positioned for approval.”\xa0During an investor call last month, he declined to share details of conversations with regulators, but said “we, of course, kept them informed along the way.”', 'This story was originally published on Banking Dive.

The heavy equipment manufacturer tends to do well when the economy is on an upswing because of higher demand for construction and infrastructure development.

One sector that currently offers some satisfying payouts is the beverage industry. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) boast dividend yields of 2.5% or higher, putting them well above the S&P 500's current dividend yield of less than 1.4%. "", ""Here's why those seeking to collect more dividend income should look closer at these beverage stocks."", ""Coca-Cola's dividend yields 3.2%. The beverage giant has an exceptional record of increasing its dividend payments. It gave its investors a 5.4% raise earlier this year. That marked its 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase. It kept Coca-Cola in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of dividend increases. "", ""The company's dividend isn't likely to fizzle out anytime soon. The beverage behemoth's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4% to 6% per year by raising prices and increasing volumes. That should drive 7% to 9% annual earnings-per-share growth and healthy free cash flow growth. "", ""That growing free cash flow, which should total $9.2 billion this year, will give Coca-Cola the funds to pay a growing dividend ($8 billion in 2023) and repurchase shares while maintaining its elite balance sheet. The company's financial strength gives it the flexibility to make acquisitions as compelling opportunities arise to add a little more pop to its already solid growth profile. "", ""Keurig Dr Pepper doesn't have quite the dividend-paying track record of Coca-Cola. However, it offers a 2.9% dividend yield. Meanwhile, the company has grown its dividend at an 11% compound annual rate over the last three years. It was able to add some more pop to the payout after achieving its leverage target following the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, which created North America's third-largest beverage company. "", ""Dividend growth is a key aspect of the company's strategy. It currently has a relatively low dividend payout ratio (45%), which enables it to retain lots of cash for debt reduction, share repurchases, and opportunistic investments. Since the merger, Keurig Dr. Pepper has cut its leverage ratio in half, from about 6 to around 3, while also investing more than $2.5 billion into high-growth category platforms and making $2.2 billion of opportunistic share repurchases over the past three years. "", ""Keurig Dr Pepper's long-term ambition is to deliver mid-single-digit net sales growth while increasing its earnings per share at a high single-digit rate. That should enable the company to generate growing free cash flow to increase its dividend while giving it the optionality to opportunistically repurchase shares and make acquisitions. "", ""Starbucks has the lowest yield in this group at 2.5%. However, that's still a lot higher than the S&P 500. Further, the coffee giant has done a tremendous job increasing its dividend over the years. It has grown its payout at a 20% compound annual rate since initiating the dividend 13 years ago, including by 7.5% last September. "", 'The company should be able to continue growing its dividend in the future. It launched its bold triple shot reinvention strategy last year. It plans to become more global by accelerating its store expansion to 55,000 locations worldwide by 2030 (up from around 38,000 at the end of last year). The company also aims to unlock efficiency gains to save $3 billion in costs over the next three years. ', ""These catalysts should drive caffeinated revenue and earnings growth. The company's long-term target is to grow its revenue by more than 10% annually while delivering 15%+ earnings growth. That faster growth could enable Starbucks to deliver accelerated dividend growth in the future. "", ""Coca-Cola, Keurig Dr Pepper, and Starbucks can quench an investor's thirst for more income.

That's not exactly explosive, but it's certainly nothing to sneeze at for a company of its size and maturity."", 'And it\'s not like Coca-Cola is resting on its laurels, either.

Coke teamed up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to launch a brand-boosting campaign named ""Create Real Magic"" last spring. By the end of summer, it had introduced several limited-edition flavors of Coca-Cola and Sprite, relying on AI to suggest interesting flavor combinations.', ""These short-lived efforts didn't exactly change the game, but they showcased Coca-Cola's willingness to tap into soaring market trends."", ""The soda titan is also dipping its toes into the booming energy drink market through a strategic partnership with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST). It's a lucrative partnership in which Monster has managed its own energy drinks alongside Coca-Cola's energy names led by the Full Throttle and NOS brands since 2014, all distributed by Coke's world-class global network of bottling partners. Coca-Cola also owns 19.6% of Monster's stock, giving the soft drink giant a significant financial interest in the energy drink specialist's business growth."", 'But perhaps the most refreshing aspect of Coca-Cola is its robust free cash flow of $9.5 billion over the last four quarters. The company is also strongly committed to returning that cash to shareholders. In the past year alone, the company has repurchased $1.7 billion worth of its own stock and paid out a whopping $8 billion in dividends. That combo hits the spot for income investors with a thirst for cash-sharing programs.', ""So, is it too late to buy Coca-Cola stock? I don't think so."", ""While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the company's strong fundamentals, reasonable valuation, and generous shareholder cash returns add up to plenty of tasty sparkle. The 3.2% dividend yield alone is reason enough to own this stock for the long haul -- just ask Warren Buffett."", 'Coca-Cola is a giant of its industry, as stable as solid rock, and an income-generating cash machine -- and you never know when the company might strike a chord with consumers over a new flavor or an innovative product line.', ""Long-term investors looking for a reliable and refreshing addition to their portfolio should consider grabbing a few shares of Coca-Cola.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) which saw its share price drive 104% higher over five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 20% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 9.1% in the last three months."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' View our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement."", ""During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.0% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 15% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""This free interactive report on Waste Management's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Waste Management the TSR over the last 5 years was 122%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""We're pleased to report that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 39% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Intuit:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.15 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$30b - US$6.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).', ""Thus, Intuit has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Software industry average of 7.4% it's much better."", ' See our latest analysis for Intuit ', ""In the above chart we have measured Intuit's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Intuit ."", ""In terms of Intuit's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 49% over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance."", ""On a side note, Intuit has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 21% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE."", ""While returns have fallen for Intuit in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 160% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view."", ""One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Intuit and understanding this should be part of your investment process."", ""While Intuit may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.', 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.', ' View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries ', ""In fact, the recent sale by Robin William Buchanan was the biggest sale of LyondellBasell Industries shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$101). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was 63% of Robin William Buchanan's holding."", ""In the last year LyondellBasell Industries insiders didn't buy any company stock.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.2% of LyondellBasell Industries shares, worth about US$55m.

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance.

Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.26% compares favorably with the industry's 4.18% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market.

In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.82% and 32.56%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to VMC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. VMC is currently averaging 933,304 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well.

Read on to see how they're helping to enable a new power paradigm built on clean energy-and how we're supporting them at Eaton."", 'Written by Dr Karina Rigby, 03/04/2024', 'Amid the push to net zero, data centers are coming under increasing scrutiny. With a reputation as energy devouring carbon culprits, these facilities are firmly in the sights of environmental groups and governments-but they actually have a vital role to play in the green revolution.', ""The World Economic Forum suggests that around 60% of global gross domestic product is now somehow digital, putting data centers firmly at the heart of economic growth for the foreseeable future. As unstoppable digitalization accelerates worldwide, there are now as many data centers planned as already exist-and that's before powerful trends like artificial intelligence have fully impacted the market. Indeed, entire regions like the Middle East are beginning to refocus from an oil-based to a digital-based economy, which can only be a good thing."", ""However, while data centers are vital to economic prosperity, they are also often regarded as digitalization's dirty secret. Headlines claiming data centers out-pollute airlines are easy to find, causing many leaders to worry about the dramatic rise in their numbers. But is this eco-unfriendly reputation fair?"", 'Accounting for about 1.5% of global energy consumption, data centers have long been striving to raise efficiency and reduce emissions. It\'s a testament to the success of these efforts that, as the IEA reports, data center emissions ""have grown only modestly despite rapidly growing demand for digital services"".', 'From our customer conversations, sustainability is now one of the core imperatives for data center operators alongside speed and cost. We have a broad range of products and services that are supporting this push, for example optimizing energy efficiency or enabling local renewable generation.', 'Emerging technology trends will only accelerate this process-for instance, switching to hydrogen rather than diesel for back up power, or enabling more efficient cooling. Over the coming years, these innovations will further drive down data center costs, energy consumption and carbon emissions.', ""Yet, such greener operations are just the beginning of the data center sustainability journey. Our market position puts us in the ideal place to survey the energy ecosystem as a whole, and it's increasingly clear that a symbiotic relationship is emerging between data centers, utilities and grid operators that will be good for everyone."", ""It's increasingly clear that a symbiotic relationship is emerging between data centers, utilities and grid operators that will be good for everyone.Karina Rigby, president, Critical Systems, Electrical Sector, EMEA"", 'The rise of energy prosumers', 'The olden days of top-down power generation, transmission and distribution are gone. Grids are becoming extremely complex and now demand much more flexibility and intelligence. Electricity no longer just flows one-way to assets hanging on the grid, but back and forth in a much more decentralized ecosystem.', ""As utilities bring more and more renewable generation online-potentially meeting around 60% of total European electricity demand by 2030-grid volatility is becoming a pressing issue. The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow, but expecting utilities or governments to build out huge amounts of back-up power generation to balance the grid isn't financially feasible, especially with energy demands rising fast as industry electrification and the electric vehicle revolution gather pace."", 'The answer lies in greater demand-side flexibility driven by a new breed of energy prosumers-entities with the ability to generate and store power locally, then feed it back into the grid. Data centers are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, because each facility already has an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that ensures normal operations can continue in the event of an electricity outage. With the right infrastructure and intelligent management capabilities, these battery backup systems can return energy to the grid to help balance demand and enable vital flexibility for the renewable revolution.', 'For utilities and grid operators, this two-way power flow with energy prosumers helps to address flexibility challenges while also providing a route to harness more renewables. Equally, data center operators, who already prioritize the best grid access, can monetize otherwise underused assets, create new revenue streams, and strengthen their net zero credentials.', ""Awareness of this symbiotic win-win is growing fast. We're proud to be enabling customers from all sides to embrace it, helping energy consumers become energy prosumers through our medium and low voltage solutions, battery technology, digital grid balancing capabilities, consulting services, and more. For instance, we're already working with major hyperscale and colocation data center players to enable grid stabilization through their UPS systems with our EnergyAware solution."", ""Expecting utilities or governments to build out huge amounts of back-up power generation to balance the grid isn't financially feasible.Karina Rigby, president, Critical Systems, Electrical Sector, EMEA"", 'Nurturing a new energy ecosystem', ""From our conversations with customers and partners on the ground, it's clear that a combination of powerful trends is driving the development of a new energy ecosystem where data centers will play an important role."", 'The rapid growth of digitalization, the energy transition to renewables, data center sustainability improvements, the rising complexity of grids, and the need for intelligent power management-all of these trends are moving at slightly different speeds, but they are all going in the same direction.', 'The economic case is strong. The sustainability argument is compelling. And the necessary technologies are coming online. The key challenge is now one of culture. Grid operators and data center energy prosumers need to align in their thinking-and that is steadily happening with more and more organizations trying to understand how they can support a net-zero playing field.', ""Government has an important role to play here in setting the right policy framework and financial incentives to drive cultural change. Demand-side players weren't previously involved in the grid, so policymakers need to incentivize data center operators to sell flexibility services. That means building the business case, clarifying the current rules, and making participation easier with advances like smart billing. Legislation like REPowerEU is a good step, helping different market players come together to fast forward the clean energy revolution."", ""Now is the time for everyone in this ecosystem to move things forward by collaborating, breaking down siloes, learning, and sharing best practices. Most importantly, we need to advance the conversation about the environmental impact of data centers and shake off their high-carbon reputation. Data centers aren't holding back a sustainable future-in fact, they're helping us get there faster."", 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eaton on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:', 'Spokesperson: EatonWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/eatonEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Eaton', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
