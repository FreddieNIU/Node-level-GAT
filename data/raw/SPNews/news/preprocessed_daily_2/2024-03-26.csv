You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Bill Mann. Bill, good to see you."", 'Bill Mann: Hey Ricky, how you doing?', 'Ricky Mulvey: I\'m doing pretty well. There is an odd international story that I want to get your take on in part because I think it\'s funny. This is the setup. ASML, which makes the machines, that makes the machines that make semiconductors, is threatening to not completely leave its home country of the Netherlands. According to Bloomberg, CEO Peter Wennink, set at a tech conference, ""We have to come to the conclusion that we can grow responsibly.', 'In the Netherlands, we have not yet drawn that conclusion."" Basically, the company says it needs more foreign talent. The Dutch government is led by a prime minister who\'s campaigned on reining in immigration. Now the company is sending out reports, reportedly, according to a Dutch newspaper, that maybe the labor situation is better for them in France and maybe they should move there. First question, Bill. Is this a bit? Are they do it a bit right now?', ""Bill Mann: I would've loved if you'd said first question, Bill, France. How France has become the potential landing spot for one of the largest technology companies in the world is somewhat fascinating. In the parlance of the movie Singles, ASML is the guy behind the guy, behind the guy, and it is the only company in Europe that's among the top 10 of global technology leaders. Yes, there is a rise of an ill liberal anti immigrant movement in the Netherlands. It has to do a little bit with the fact that tremendously successful companies like ASML and AdGen, which is also based in the Netherlands, have required so much housing and it is driven by immigration. They have been so successful that it's raised housing prices. It's a little bit of an immigrant crisis than you would see."", ""For example, in the US where it is low-skill immigration, these are highly skilled immigrants. Because they are raising the prices of everything around these markets, people are getting. This is something that goes back 100 years. It's called the Dutch disease. The Netherlands physically is pretty small and so ASML is looking at the environment in the Netherlands and they're using this to their advantage to say, we could move to France very easily where it's much bigger and we have plenty of more space to get skilled workers because the Netherlands does not produce enough."", ""Ricky Mulvey: This Saturday show is going to be a bit of a departure where Bill and I will be doing a 3-4-hour deep dive on Dutch immigration policies. I'm going to just step away from that first."", ""Bill Mann: Mark your calendar, it's going to be great."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We will talk until we get to the truth Bill. You touched on this, but Shell and Unilever have left the Netherlands and in the past few years relocated their global headquarters, but this time is a little different. It's a much bigger deal. If ASML relocates, the government has a cross-ministry plan. It's called Project Beethoven, which could give the title person arrays. Why is the Dutch government so worried about ASML moving?"", 'Bill Mann: Why did they name it after a German guy?', ""Ricky Mulvey: That's a good question."", ""Bill Mann: We'll get back to the we can talk about that during our discussion over the weekends."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Was it the movie? Wasn't there a big Beethoven dog movie? We don't know, we can't get inside their brains."", ""Bill Mann: This is a bigger deal because ASML is such a landmark company. It is such an important company. It's 20% of the value of the Dutch stock market. It's 10% of the entire Eurozone blue-chip index. This is a landmark company and a source of pride for the Netherlands. It would be not even low-key. It would be high-key disastrous for the Netherlands if ASML moves."", ""Now, we see this in a lot of countries around the world. Including the United States of America, where we have technology companies that make a ratable portion of a country or some other geographic or political entity's revenue base. We've seen it in banking. We've seen Tesla move from California to Texas. This is another component of this same exact move where you have these very large companies and they do have some power to get governments to do things that they want them to do"", ""Ricky Mulvey: I want to focus on the business for a sec of what it's doing right now. Because on the one hand, this has the classic economists talk on the one hand and the other hand. On the one hand, the market has awarded ASML a significantly higher earnings multiple, straight price-to-sales multiple over the past year. The forward P went up from 30-ish to 45. Straight-up price to sales went 8-13. For a manufacturing company, that seems to me a little frothy. You have the CEO saying, yo, friends, we are having a really difficult time growing and we have serious issues growing our company. What's going on with this disconnect in someone with exactly one ASML share, what should I do Bill Mann?"", ""Bill Mann: I would hold onto that ASML share as tight as you can. This is a company that what's that old that old acronym tina, there is no alternative. There is no alternative to ASML at this point. They make machines that cost 1/3 of a billion dollars. They are absolutely, again, backing companies like Nvidia who will have a very hard time manufacturing and meeting their own goals if it is not for ASML."", ""This is a company for which when you talk about growth, you're really talking about rates of growth as opposed to the tenacity of that growth or the duration of the growth. ASML has a very long ramp in front of it and it will be very difficult to disrupt, so he's exactly right. I think that ASML is moving up for the same exact reasons, maybe at the vigor which Nvidia has done so and that is the move in almost every industry to artificial intelligence."", ""Ricky Mulvey: There's a market leader. In this spot that is going to be significantly different from the market leaders we're about to talk about next. Let's do some EVs around the world. BMW got a, I would say, just glowing profile in the New York Times about how the company has adopted a different strategy than a lot of other carmakers, which I will call the Kinder eggs strategy, where they have the same body for the car but the insides a little different."", 'You have gas, diesel, EVs, hybrids. Paraphrasing the article. ""The company says that buyers should be able to choose a car\'s propulsion technology as easily as choosing its color."" Beforehand, this would seem like a very difficult strategy, where you have to change the entire chassis and make them interchangeable. Seems like there\'d be a lot of tech challenges there. But BMW figured it out and it should more carmakers follow this lead?', ""Bill Mann: I think we should call it. I loved the Kinder egg strategy. I think we should put it into its original German, so it'd be the Kinder eye strategy."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Thank you.', ""Bill Mann: I'm here to help. The thing about BMW is that it has been a manufacturing powerhouse. They've always been very good at it. That is, it's the German way, if you will. A lot of companies, as they've been trying to catch up with Tesla and the other leaders in the EV market have set aside facilities that are strictly electric vehicle manufacturing and heavy in some ways just moved away from the internal combustion engine in order to favor EVs. It may work, it may not."", ""I would suggest that BMW has gone very quickly from being a laggard to being a real success story in EVs. They sold nearly 400,000 of them in the last year, which is a huge 75% increase from the previous year. Now, maybe that doesn't sound like much because we are used to EVs being in the midst of a massive growth trajectory. 2023 was a pretty bad year for electric vehicle manufacturers in general. Not only did BMW do well, but they've done well going against the tide, and so there is something to be said."", ""Again, maybe this is the BMW way and maybe I am just creating a little bit or buying into the mystique, if you will, of BMW but they are such a good manufacturing company that this actually may be an area for them that is a differentiator. Like what would you like? You want a gas engine, we've got that. You want to hybrid, we've got that. You want fully electric, we can do that. It remains to be seen. Just letting the market determine what it wants on an individual basis, whether it will work but BMWs experienced this last year suggests they're on to something."", ""Ricky Mulvey: This article is also talking about how maybe Tesla is losing that technology edge against other carmakers. Maybe one other benefit is that I don't really know the name of BMW CEO, and that might be useful right now for selling cars. Do you think this article is onto something where maybe Tesla is losing that edge in technology?"", ""Bill Mann: Well, the CEO's name is Oliver Zipse."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Thank you.', ""Bill Mann: It's just fun to say."", 'Ricky Mulvey: You are really on your helpful streets today.', 'Bill Mann: Say it with me now. Zipse.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Zipse.', 'Bill Mann: Very good. Actually, that was terrible.', 'Bill Mann: I think BMW has learned a tremendous amount from the American regulatory way of allowing winners to identify themselves. Do you remember back in the day when we first were getting into HDTVs and in Europe they made a designation for the type of technology that was going to be their chosen one. In the US, the regulators just said, ""Well, let\'s just see what happens."" We centered upon a certain technology and that\'s what ended up winning. It is a very powerful, if slightly risky way to go about allowing a winner to reveal itself.', ""I think BMW has taken that lesson to heart and that's what they're bringing to the table. They know, they know how to manufacture may be better than anybody else, and that is a dirty little secret about Tesla. They've had great technology. They were not a manufacturing leader. They did not bring much to the table there. They did append some things. They should be given an immense amount of credit for that, but ultimately, they are not a manufacturer. BMW is, and so, all of the companies that are out there that I think could really compete long-term with Tesla, BMW, Volkswagen are very much near the top of the list."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is this worth a spot on investors Radar, this carmaker, BMW?', ""Bill Mann: I absolutely believe it is. Remember two years ago there was basically this thought process that all of the legacy car manufacturers were doomed, not just because of Tesla, but also because of the upstart Chinese, in particular EV manufacturers. They still do have a catch-up in that regard, but BMW is painting the way toward the future because I happen to believe that there is a future where internal combustion engines are going to have a place in the market, and BMW is saying, sure, let's just assume that that market continues to exist. Why would we not allow our buyers to determine what path they want to take? Choose your own adventure with your fuel of choice for your autos. That's absolutely fine with BMW because they manufacturer so well."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah. The largest seller of electric vehicles right now is BYD, but it seems to have the tremendous caveat that most of those car sales are within China where it receives a tremendous amount of subsidies. It's having some problems shipping cars abroad and building new markets, particularly in Europe, in North America, and I guess it's like, does it even matter if you're the largest EV seller if you can't do it outside of your home country? I don't know."", ""Bill Mann: Ricky, I don't know if you've heard about this, but China is a pretty good market to start in."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a good market to start in. Yeah."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah. It's not like they're the number one EV manufacturer in Thailand. They are in a huge, very competitive market and they are winning. There was a Wall Street Journal story that came out about BYD struggles going abroad, and I think that there are a couple of things that are at issue here. They are following the path that Japanese companies and Korean companies with their auto-manufacturers did in the past, and I think because China does not have a reputation as making very good consumer electronics, and I'm pushing the definition calling a car a consumer electronic, but an EV is not not a consumer electronic, but the tendency is to discount the Chinese prowess in these regards. Would you say that's correct?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think that's fair."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah. It's just fair. This is not making your designation, what I believe, I think that's just simply the case. Anytime there is a problem or a defect with a Chinese consumer electronics or an EV, it's really easy to say, well, China just doesn't have the quality there yet, where in actuality, they're going through the same exact curve that happened with Japan and happened with Korea. I am not so old that I don't remember when Hyundai first came into the US and they had a huge amount of difficulty gaining credibility as a car manufacturer and everything that was wrong with the first Hyundai cars that came into the United States, they were highlighted, they were amplified, so yes, this is a problem for BYD, but I think to the extent that you want them to succeed, I think a little bit of patience would help."", ""Ricky Mulvey: My point that I should have said, the car that they're selling for less than $20,000 goes for more than 40,000 in a country like Germany. They're playing a different game outside of their home court, if you will. We're at the end of earnings season, and it's been an interesting one. Any general reflections, thoughts, lessons learned as you look back on this past earning season."", 'Bill Mann: I think if there were anybody left too, was skeptical about how artificial intelligence was going to change commerce. The time is now to accept that it is. Now companies like Invitia are trading at tremendous multiples.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Thank you for your time and insight.', 'Bill Mann: Thanks Ricky.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey, co-host of Motley Fool Money here.

How does that work in practical terms, Emily, such as paying for the mortgage or even just going out to eat?', ""Emily Williamson: What we have done for a long time, is we look at how much we make together and then how much each of our paychecks are our salaries, and we split our bills as a proportion of the total. We look at our bills first and then we split our income as a proportion of what we both make. That goes into our joint account. Out of our joint account, we pay all of our bills that are non-negotiable, so, mortgage, car, escrow, some health college that we have shared, and then as far as eating out, I don't know. Maybe where you let a camp of what most Americans do, but we share a credit card, and so, we have a budget, that we try to stick to. It's become very difficult with inflation, but that's why we've cut travel, fun things, restaurants, or eat in malls, any extra expenditures and then we split that 50-50 every month. Into our joint account because 50% of what our propellers budget should be for our credit card every month, and as we go into that, then we decide to make it up."", ""Paul Ballasts: Yeah. I really like our joint credit card because we accumulate so many points for things that we're going to spend, like we're going to buy gas, we're going to go out to eat, so, we might as well put it on the credit card, and the end of the year we have all these points and we think it is cash back or take a trip with it.

At this point, I'm going to see you into the Dr. The Dr. will see you now. Dr. Bro, take it away."", ""Robert Brokamp: Well, first of all, it sounds like you two are in great shape. I can just tell by the way, the two of you interact that I think you're mostly on the same page, but it's fine if you're not always on the same page. Most couples aren't. Let's talk a little bit about goals. First of all, there's always the goals that just about anyone with a certified financial planner designation like me, we'll say just about everyone should have, and we'll talk very briefly about those, but then there's the individual goals and the couple goals, but that's where there might be some more give-and-take or compromise and we'll get into those as well, and you have some ideas about what those would be. Let's start with the prerequisites. We'll just go through these real quickly. Do you have an emergency fund? That pile of cash that you can rely on if there's a big ticket expense, or as Paul pointed out, if you temporarily lose your job for a while?"", ""Paul Ballasts: We do. I think I'd like it to be six months and it's probably like three-months."", ""Robert Brokamp: Good. Okay. Well, it will conclude, by the way, with a to-do list. That's one thing to the add to the to-do list. Do you generally pay off that credit card each month?"", 'Paul Ballasts: Yeah.', ""Robert Brokamp: The good news is you don't have a revolving balance of credit card debt is not an issue. How about an estate plan? Will and a trust or something like that?"", 'Emily Williamson: We do not. Recently really got one now.', ""Robert Brokamp: Another opportunity. So we'll add that to the to-do list. You can do a lot of it on your own just by updating your beneficiary designations on things like your IRAs and 401Ks. If I assume you would deem each other, but then you named secondaries in case something happens to both of you. You can change your bank accounts to payable on death accounts and your brokerage accounts to transfer on death accounts. You could do all that on your own, which makes your state planning a lot easier, but you probably should, in the end, get a will."", ""I know you have pets, don't have kids, but you have pets. You could put in your will who you want to take care of the pets. You can even create a trust so that would pay for the care of your pets. These are things you would talk with an attorney to get a truly solid estate plan. If one of you passed away, will the other be fine financially? Devastated emotionally, of course, but financially, would you be fine?"", ""Emily Williamson: Yeah, I think they're going to be fine."", 'Paul Ballasts: Yeah. We both have life insurance on each other.', 'Robert Brokamp: You already had the life insurance, so no need to get more life insurance. And then finally, are you saving for retirement?', 'Emily Williamson: Yes.', 'Paul Ballasts: Just doing the company 401K. I think we each have a IRA, at least I think I do.', ""Emily Williamson: I do. No, you don't have an IRA but"", ""Robert Brokamp: Have you sat down and calculated whether you're saving enough to retire around your mid '60s or so?"", 'Paul Ballasts: No.', ""Emily Williamson: No. Let's use the little calculator on Schwab, like that lane and see if that looks OK."", 'Paul Ballasts: My company uses Schwab too.', ""Robert Brokamp: Got it. That's another opportunity, we'll add that to the to-do list. Now, let's get into the individual goals that you've told us about. Emily, you have an interesting one. You want to open a bed and breakfast and grow all the food that you would cook for the guests, for breakfast and dinner a couple times a week. Tell us about that."", ""Emily Williamson: Why? I love gardening and I love cooking, and a lot of those things. It just feels like I don't even know if I would call it a career AOI passion on islands that's calling to me. One day, probably not in Denver, but somewhere else. Paul and I talked about this, having a bed and breakfast. I think call it a hobby farm, actually, where we welcome guest then we'd have to buy the property, get the gardens. I'd love sitting in some learning buffering up there, maybe go onto my experiences in Europe and across the country. I think there's only a few places where this is actually how the bed and breakfast work in American, but I think this is the thing than other countries though."", 'Robert Brokamp: Do you have any experience doing this type of work.', ""Emily Williamson: I have experience gardening and cooking for others, but not hosting of BNB. We have a VRBO property, but we're not there like the folks that comps. So no experienced. We did actually, a long time ago, when we first bought our house, we Airbnb the bedroom, like wheel-end Garo and we Airbnb at the room. Actually that was soviet too. I'm a little bit of experience."", ""Paul Ballasts: I don't recommend that."", 'Robert Brokamp: I was going to say, let go.', ""Emily Williamson: Just $40 a night, so we only got college students and we got our dogs and that was also not OK with people. I mean, we're in Colorado, you can imagine what they wanted to do up here."", ""Paul Ballasts: The college, it would come over 02:00 A.M. Half drunk and like wake up the dogs, we're like, how boy?"", 'Robert Brokamp: Paul, how do you feel about that goal?', ""Paul Ballasts: I think it's really cool. I'd love to be part of that. I love everything cycling, so where that's scrabbled bike riding, mountain bike riding. I see a big red eye care, but now mountain biking has taken over my life in Colorado. I'd love to lead people on biking tours at this Airbnb. My dad lives on a farm, so I know a little bit about what it's like to live on a hobby farm. Helping out there, it'd be cool."", ""And in general, I think my financial goal, I just want to have more freedom in 10 years. I don't want it to be so reliant on my job. I want to work because I like working and it gives me purpose. But if I were to take three months off because I want to go bike across the country, I want to be able to do that without such a huge financial hit. I think that freedom is related to Emily's BNB because it's like we would need a lot of financial freedom to come do something like that."", ""Robert Brokamp: Which gets to the individual goals that you expressed, which is to be financially independent in 10 years. It sounds to me like it's not necessarily being fully retired, but just having the freedom to do things you want while still moving in and out of the job for us?"", ""Paul Ballasts: I will say like, I've been talking to some of my friends lately and they're starting to do more grown up investments. I guess I'd call them, like I was talking with one of my buddies the other day and he just invested in like a multi family real estate fund. I was like, that's pretty cool, and it got me thinking, should I be doing stuff like that? Or is that like maybe I shouldn't because I don't understand it? Just thinking a little bit more about other things rather than my job."", ""Robert Brokamp: The good news is when I saw your goals, someone wanting to run an Airbnb and another spouse may be completely opposed to it, but you don't seem to be in that situation, so that's very good. That was my Number 1 concern, but I'm glad to hear that not only are you on the same page, but you both have a little bit of experience doing this. One final question and then I'll give you the diagnosis, the to-do list. On a scale of 1-10, Paul, how important is it that you are financially independent a decade from now? Ten being like you absolutely positively want to be financially independent, and then lower numbers would be like, yeah I'm little flexible with that timeline."", 'Paul Ballasts: Just six.', ""Robert Brokamp: A six? Good. Here we go. Here's the diagnosis and your to-do list. The first thing, of course, is to get the estate plan. I think you could do a lot of this on your own, but you probably shouldn't see an attorney. Because you don't have kids, you possibly could get away with doing a will or something like that from an online, from a website, but generally, I think it's still good to hire an attorney to do that.and you may already have attorneys since you have a VRBO and things like that."", 'The BNB thing is a journey. There is, first of all, an exploration in terms of how much you really want to do it. I looked and there are plenty of classes, webinars, books about how to do it. There used to be a company called Vocation Vacations, in which you took time off to work another job to see if you liked it, and one of the options was to help run a BNB. Unfortunately, this company no longer exists, but you still might be able to find a BNB that will let you work there for a little while to see if you like it, because you may end up feeling OK.', ""This sounded like a good idea, but the day to day is actually a grind. But on the other hand, you may love it, and then that's a point where you have to start looking at the numbers. You have to figure out how much does it cost to buy the place? What are the finances? What can I project in terms of revenue and things like that? You'll learn that, I'm sure, if you'd start taking classes and books. Then decide the timeline and what it takes to get there? You do that just with a regular old calculator."", ""Then you'll decide whether, for example, you need to save up for that or do you sell the rental property you have, and then use that money to buy the BNB, especially if the rental property is not cash-flow positive. If it's cash-flow positive, you might want to keep it, but if it's not cash-flow positive, you might want to sell that to put it toward other goals."", ""Then just the terms that we talked previously about the retirement calculating, and it could also be related to the financial independence. If I were really your financial planner or your financial therapists, I could run those numbers for you, but instead, you can use the retirement calculator. My favorite retirement calculator is the CalcXML comprehensive retirement planning module, which if you do an online search for that, you'll find that. You just put in your number, it'll tell you basically, at what point will you retire given your current trajectory? How much you're saving? How much you have, things like that."", ""Then you just fiddle with the numbers to see like, I want to retire sooner, how much do I have to save? How much do I have to shave down by expenses too? That will give you a general idea of where you're going now and what you can do to change that. Since, Paul, you said you're a six on that financial independence that gives you a little wiggle room in terms of flying, if we do this, I'll be financially independent in the 13 years or so and maybe you're fine with that. How does that sound? It sounds good to you? Any questions?"", 'Paul Ballasts: I would say what steps do we need to start taking now to be more financially independent in 10 years?', ""Robert Brokamp: It just depends on what you're doing now. You might look at your numbers given that you seemed to be generally financially responsible and you might already be in better shape than you think you are. You just have to crunch the numbers. But then apart from that, it really comes down to saving more. It is the VRBO that you have, is that cash-flow positive?"", ""Paul Ballasts: We only had it for two years, so it's still new. But it pays for the mortgage every month, which is great."", ""Robert Brokamp: That's great."", ""Paul Ballasts: But we're not raking in the extra money."", ""Robert Brokamp: That's good to know. If you were saying that you are actually losing money every month on it, I'd be like, that may be a situation where you sell that, take whatever money you've made and I assume you've made money over the last couple of years, and then put it toward other goals. But if it's at least covering the cost, that might be a worthwhile investment. You talked about the private real estate. That is something you could explore. It's not really necessary. It usually takes a decent amount of money and they tend to be more illiquid. But you might look at the possibility and find it something worth doing, but you don't have to do that. Plenty of people become financially independent just by investing in the stock market."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

If you want to skip our discussion on the finance industry, head over to 5 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To Buy.\xa0', ""In the past year, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank caused major repercussions in the banking sector, particularly affecting regional banks. Even major US financial institutions faced challenges throughout 2023. In 2024, a\xa0global economic slowdown and macroeconomic weakness fuelled by high interest rates are expected to stir up problems for the banking industry. Although governments worldwide are implementing measures to control inflation, many factors still pose a risk to economic prosperity, including supply chain disruptions, changing trade relationships, geopolitical tensions, and extreme weather events. IMF's latest forecasts indicate global economic growth of only 3% in 2024, with developed economies showing modest growth rates and emerging economies experiencing notable growth.\xa0"", ""According to a Deloitte report, banks globally will face challenges that impact their revenue generation and cost management in 2024. High interest rates have increased net interest income, especially in the United States and Canada, while also driving up funding costs and reducing margins consequently. The global banking industry is now faced with an uphill battle to control deposit costs while customer expectations and market competition skyrocket. Loan growth is forecasted to be modest, given the high borrowing costs and overall macroeconomic dynamics, with banks likely to maintain restrictive credit lending policies. While consumer spending is strong, demand for credit card and auto loans is predicted to remain robust, while demand for corporate loans may temporarily weaken before likely recovering later this year. Additionally, climate change considerations are largely impacting credit availability and loan demand. The blend of higher deposit costs, lower policy rates, and limited loan potential may affect banks' ability to maintain strong net interest margins in 2024. Looking ahead, the global banking landscape is expected to experience further transformation, with Chinese and American banks dominating global rankings and rising influence from Indian banks and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds anticipated over the coming decade."", 'In 2024, Fidelity believes there may be a reason for cautious optimism despite the unsettling closures in 2023, which were driven by specific circumstances not necessarily applicable to all banks and financial institutions. Macroeconomic factors such as growth, inflation, and Federal Reserve policy will likely remain pivotal for the financial sector and the broader market. Recent events at Silicon Valley Bank underscored the importance of deposit quality in the current environment. With interest rates rising, depositors now have higher-yielding options for their excess cash, making deposits more susceptible to potential flight. Hence, focusing on high-quality deposits has become imperative. Institutions like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and M&T Bank illustrate the advantages of such stability.\xa0', 'In 2024, many financial services dealmakers are feeling more optimistic compared to last year, as recent improvements in financial markets and positive signals about interest rates from central banks are slowly restoring investor confidence. Present market conditions, paired with ongoing initiatives like digitalization, sustainability, and addressing workforce challenges, are pushing financial services players to quicken their transformation efforts to remain competitive and profitable. M&A remains a significant part of this transformation journey, especially as organic growth faces challenges in the current macroeconomic environment. Dealmakers are likely to prefer smaller transactions over mega-deals to facilitate transformational steps. Deal processes may also become more complex and protracted. According to PwC, some sectors within the financial services industry are especially attractive for M&A activity in 2024. These include asset and wealth management, insurance, private equity, payments, and fintech. Asset and wealth managers are expected to boost M&A to achieve scale and acquire new capabilities, while insurance companies may divest complex legacy portfolios to reduce costs and enhance capital efficiency. Private equity investors are largely focusing on financial services-related sectors, such as insurance brokerage and fintech, for M&A opportunities. Regulatory pressure and stakeholder expectations on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are also increasing, influencing business decisions and investment strategies.', 'Some of the best financial stocks to buy include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Visa Inc.

Critically, the Company’s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants.

Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with ARE.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc is an urban office real estate investment trust (REIT). It is engaged in the business of providing space for lease to life science, agtech, and technology tenants. The company has established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science, agtech, and technology campuses that provide tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments. Alexandria also provides strategic capital to transformative life science, agtech, and technology companies through its venture capital platform.', 'Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1997, with dividends currently distributed on a quarterly basis. The company has increased its dividend each year since 2010, earning it the status of a dividend achiever. This honor is reserved for companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 14 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.95% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.04%, suggesting an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 5.40%. This rate increased to 5.80% per year over a five-year horizon, and over the past decade, the annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 6.60%. Based on the dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc stock as of today is approximately 5.24%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's dividend payout ratio is 1.95, which may suggest that the company's dividend could be at risk."", ""Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of the past 10 years."", ""A company must have robust growth metrics to ensure the sustainability of dividends. Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 4.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 54.38% of global competitors. The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's earnings increased by approximately -11.60% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 23.08% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -1.30%, which outperforms approximately 37.18% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's commitment to increasing dividends, evidenced by its status as a dividend achiever, is commendable. However, the high dividend payout ratio raises questions about the sustainability of these payments. The company's strong profitability rank and solid growth metrics provide some reassurance, but investors should keep an eye on these figures. With a forward-looking approach, examining the company's capacity to maintain its dividend in light of its financial health and industry trends will be crucial for investors. Will Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc continue its legacy of rewarding shareholders amidst the challenges ahead? That remains a question for value investors to ponder as they assess the company's long-term potential."", 'GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It isn't the only way to build up a large retirement nest egg, of course, but owning a diversified portfolio of stocks puts you in a great position to benefit from the long-term growth of the global economy."", ""Besides having a long holding period, the other main ingredient necessary to produce great returns is owning the right stocks. You'll do well simply matching the wider market's roughly 15% annual appreciation. But extending that figure by even a percentage point or two can make a huge difference over several decades."", ""With that goal in mind, let's look at a few stocks that seem destined to be a positive force in your retirement portfolio."", ""Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) business has been going through a rough patch lately, with sales declining to $383 billion from $394 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Consumers were less excited to purchase iPhone and Mac products in 2023 as demand for tech devices slowed overall following big gains in the prior two years."", ""Apple is still an incredibly strong business. The company's $383 billion of revenue last year compares well to the $366 billion posted two years earlier. Success in its rapidly expanding services segment offset most of the weakness in the iPhone and Mac franchises in 2023, and that should help to stabilize growth going forward. Growth has returned at the start of fiscal 2025, although it will take some time before it speeds back up toward the double digits."", ""Meanwhile, you'll struggle to find a more financially impressive company. Apple regularly generates more than $100 billion in annual operating cash flow. Those resources allow management to spend aggressively on repurchasing the stock, which in turn amplifies per-share earnings growth.

Walmart won't quickly double or triple its current $500 billion market capitalization."", ""But that doesn't mean you can't get great returns from holding this retailer over the next several decades. Sales growth was robust in 2023 and was anchored by rising customer traffic. That success reflects Walmart's ability to deliver value to its core shoppers, who are increasingly looking for deals. Few of its peers can match Walmart's low prices, which flow from its massive economies of scale."", ""Shareholders today have a good chance at capitalizing on Walmart's push to become more than just a brick-and-mortar retailer. E-commerce sales last year crossed $100 billion and jumped more than 20% compared to the prior year. Walmart is getting a lift from its growing digital advertising business as well."", ""These wins are lifting the company's profit margin above the 3% to 4% rate that investors have seen for many years. Even a small uptick here would have a huge impact on Walmart's annual earnings potential -- if the retailer can make it a sustainable one."", ""While they wait for progress on this score, shareholders can collect Walmart's dividend and allow those quarterly payments to automatically reinvest into more shares.

The average RTH stock price target of $227.80 implies 8.1% upside potential.', 'While some investors will understandably shudder at the “retail” part of RTH’s name, its impressive performance over the long term and its strong underlying holdings show why you can’t always judge a book by its cover and why it pays to look beneath the surface and evaluate an ETF’s holdings.', 'I’m bullish on RTH, given its admirable performance over the years and its strong portfolio, which consists of large positions in long-term retail winners with impressive Smart Scores like Amazon, Home Depot, Costco, and Walmart.', 'Disclosure']"

That's where they can use their scale and their buying power to meet that demand."", ""So, it makes good sense for them to pivot. And as we also saw from Nordstrom's. What have they said recently? Nordstrom's rack is the biggest brand for them to drive their growth. They've taken their focus off the Department store.

If you would like to skip our discussion on the trends and statistics in homelessness, you can go to the 5 US Cities With Largest Homeless Populations.', ""According to the Housing and Urban Development Office (HUD)'s most recent Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR), over 650,000 people in America do not have permanent shelter as of 2023. This is the highest number of homeless people observed since the first report in 2007, and it represents a 12% rise over the previous year. There are various reasons for this growth, such as increasing housing expenses, heightened immigration rates, and the conclusion of numerous COVID-19 relief measures. Sadly, the number of Americans facing homelessness has consistently increased in each recorded year since 2016, following an annual decline from 2012 to 2015. The proportion of homeless people residing in shelters in 2023 remained nearly the same as the previous year. Six out of ten homeless people, equivalent to 396,494 people, were given temporary refuge through emergency facilities, local safe havens, or transitional housing programs. The remaining 40%, or 256,610 persons, resorted to sleeping in areas declared inappropriate for human habitation, such as sidewalks, bus terminals, empty buildings, or abandoned vehicles. Unsheltered homelessness has risen for the seventh consecutive year in 2023."", ""The rise in the number of homeless families, which increased for the second year in a row, is especially concerning. In 2023, 57,563 family households were homeless nationwide. These family units housed 186,084 people, accounting for nearly one-third or 29% of the total homeless population. This figure represents a 16% increase from 2022. Around 91% of homeless families were provided with shelter, in contrast to only 49% of single homeless adults. Homelessness in the US isn't limited to big city streets or remote areas; it affects towns of all sizes and spans from one coast to the other. California, New York, Florida, Washington, and Texas have the highest homeless populations by state, with California and New York accounting for 44% of all Americans suffering homelessness."", ""One of the causes of increased homelessness is the unavailability of affordable housing. Homebay's study shows the link between expensive housing and the occurrence of homelessness in the United States. The study found that cities with higher property prices than the national average have a greater percentage of homelessness. Cities with house values below the national average, on the other hand, have much fewer homeless people, approximately 2.5 times fewer. As a result, a scarcity of affordable housing directly contributes to the increasing rate of homelessness in the United States. So, it is quite likely that you will find home prices to be quite high in cities with the highest homeless rate per capita."", 'The residential real estate market in the United States is predicted to reach $2.80 trillion by 2028, increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.04% between 2023 and 2028.

While the U.S. faces this significant milestone, findings from MetLife’s 2024 Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract Poll show a vast majority (91%) of plan sponsors are concerned that their future retirees will run out of money in retirement. When asked about what percentage of future retirees will run out of money in retirement, 83% of plan sponsors believe more than 1 in 4 retirees will deplete their retirement savings prematurely.', '""When planning for a successful retirement, the biggest risk facing plan participants is longevity risk, which means living beyond the average life expectancy. As a result, individuals can potentially underestimate the savings they will need,"" says Roberta Rafaloff, vice president and head of Institutional Income Annuities at MetLife. ""Longevity insurance, like qualifying longevity annuity contracts, can help address this challenge by generating income at a later age.""', 'A qualifying longevity annuity contract (QLAC) is a fixed deferred annuity provided as a distribution option from qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans or individual retirement accounts (IRA). QLACs are typically purchased at the point of retirement, with the guaranteed annuity benefit commencing at an advanced age, typically age 80 or 85. By deferring payments to a later age, participants can maximize their income and ensure they have a guaranteed income stream when other retirement income sources may run short. In addition, the portion of the defined contribution (DC) plan balance that participants use for a QLAC will be excluded from the account balance used to determine the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). As a result, more money can remain in the plan, with the potential to grow, and participants continue to have access to low-cost funds.', 'Plan Sponsors’ Understanding of Longevity Risk', 'While plan sponsors are concerned about retirees running out of money, the Poll found that many plan sponsors underestimate longevity risk. When asked about the chances that an individual will live beyond age 86, 54% of plan sponsors underestimate that half of individuals will live beyond average life expectancy. Additionally, most plan sponsors (78%) underestimate the number of centenarians – those who reach the age of 100 – projected for the United States in the future.', 'According to the Poll, more than half of plan sponsors (54%) identified inflation risk, a decline in purchasing power, as the greatest retirement risk, while 23% identified longevity as the greatest retirement risk.', '""While inflation can have a significant negative impact on retirees’ ability to rely on their savings, longevity risk should not be ignored,"" says Rafaloff. ""During retirement, individuals face a number of risks, including inflation, investment and interest rate risk. But the impact of these risks can be exacerbated the longer an individual lives in retirement.""', 'Solutions Addressing Longevity Risk', 'Currently, most plan sponsors offer a systematic withdrawal program (SWiP) or other drawdown strategy to help retirees spend down their assets. However, this may pose a challenge to ensuring successful retirement outcomes. When asked what they believe the safe starting annual withdrawal amount for an individual retired at age 65 with a DC plan savings of $100,000 and a 30-year time horizon, 31% overestimate how much a retiree can safely withdraw annually.', 'Beyond these drawdown strategies, plan sponsors are now looking at offering solutions that provide guaranteed streams of income. When shown a hypothetical example of how much yearly income an immediate income annuity and a longevity annuity would provide, a majority (81%) of plan sponsors say they would consider offering an immediate income annuity and 66% would consider offering a QLAC. For those plan sponsors who identified longevity as the greatest retirement risk, 72% would consider offering a QLAC.', 'Not only are plan sponsors open to offering these solutions to participants, 70% of plan sponsors say they would consider purchasing a QLAC for their own retirement.', '""By using a QLAC to insure their longevity risk, plan participants will have an easier time determining how much they can draw down from their retirement savings before benefit payments begin,"" says Rafaloff. ""Because of this, MetLife believes that QLACs and other retirement income solutions should be given careful consideration by plan sponsors to help protect their participants’ retirement security. And, we are seeing them take action by discussing these options with their advisors.""', 'According to the Poll, 94% of plan sponsors say their DC plan consultants or advisors discuss retirement income options with them. For QLACs, 82% of plan sponsors report they are being discussed with their DC plan consultants or advisors.', 'About the Study', 'The MetLife 2024 Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract Poll was fielded between January 9 and January 16, 2024. MetLife commissioned MMR Research Associates, Inc. to conduct the online survey. Survey responses were received from 250 plan sponsors in human resources/benefits, treasury, and finance whose organizations have one or more DC plans. Respondents had either final decision-making authority or a lot of influence regarding their company’s retirement benefits and programs, and they had to be familiar with the various DC plan retirement income options available today.

We will begin by discussing the financial advisory service market and credit card and student loan debt in the US. If you want to skip this discussion, visit 7 Biggest Financial Mistakes That Young Adults Make.\xa0', 'According to experts, by the time you reach 30, you should have saved an amount equal to your yearly salary. For some, this target is achievable. However, for those who make financial mistakes as young adults, it becomes increasingly difficult.\xa0', 'Individuals and businesses at all stages need to make sound financial decisions and avoid as many financial mistakes as possible. This is why the financial advisory service market is expected to grow at a rate of 5.3% for the forecast period of 2022 to 2032. It was valued at $94.8 billion in 2022 and will reach $157.7 billion by 2032. Businesses and individuals in this industry give financial services and advice to small and medium-sized businesses and high-networth individuals. In addition, more and more people are looking for alternative investments, which is why financial literacy is becoming quite important.\xa0', 'Companies in the financial services market are some of the largest in the United States. One such is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). It is an investment banking and financial services firm that also provides discretionary investment options to its clients. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) earned a revenue of $54 billion in the past year leading up to September 30th. In the last quarter of the year, Morgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reported growth of $13.27 billion in revenue.\xa0', 'The United States is the financial hub of the world with the largest GDP. However, many people in the country still lack financial literacy, the signs of which can be seen in its credit card debt. According to a Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average credit card debt was on the rise for Americans at least until the second quarter of 2023. The report tells us that credit card balances increased by $45 billion between quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2023. This amounts to a 4.6% increase in a single quarter. As per the report, cardholders have a total debt of $1.03 trillion.\xa0', 'The average balance of credit cards is $5,733 per cardholder. In addition, average credit card interest rates were 20.68% in quarter 2 of 2023. This means that those who pay only the minimum monthly payment on the average $5,733 balance on the credit card end up paying over $1,000 in interest payment. The situation is even worse when we consider the fact that many credit card holders pay their credit card amount in full, so actual balances on credit cards may be higher. The money they will end up paying because of the exorbitant interest rates could have been utilized elsewhere.\xa0', 'Another financial burden on the American economy comes in the form of student loans. Student debt in the country has been piling up over the years, but 2023 saw a decline. Nevertheless, the outstanding Federal student loan is $1.7 trillion, and accounts for almost 93% of all student loan debt. There are currently more than 43 million student loan borrowers, and the average federal student loan debt balance is more than $37,000.\xa0', 'However, The United States government recognizes this situation and sometimes carries out student debt forgiveness schemes. More recently, in January 2024, the Biden Administration approved debt cancellation of 74,000 borrowers. These borrowers include public service workers such as firefighters, nurses, and teachers. Amongst them, 30,000 had been paying back their student loans for at least 20 years.\xa0', 'Taking out student loans and accumulating credit card debt, are part of our list of the 20 biggest financial mistakes that young adults make, although you would have to go through the list to find out where they rank.\xa0', ""A customer withdrawing money from an ATM, illustrating the company's widespread availability of accounts."", 'To curate our list of the 20 financial mistakes that young adults make, we went to Reddit and sampled five related threads to read up on real-life experiences of people.

Read carefully before investing."", 'Risk Considerations: There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in the portfolios. Please be aware that the portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Portfolio Turnover. Consistent with its investment policies, the Fund will purchase and sell securities without regard to the effect on portfolio turnover. Higher portfolio turnover will cause the Fund to incur additional transaction costs. Active Management Risk. In pursuing the Portfolio’s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions will affect performance. ETF Structure Risks. Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. The Portfolio has a limited number of intermediaries that act as authorized participants and none of these authorized participants is or will be obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. As a result, shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (""NAV"") and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. Cash Transactions Risk. Unlike certain ETFs, the Fund may effect creations and redemptions in cash or partially in cash. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in shares may be less tax-efficient. Trading Risk. The market prices of Shares are expected to fluctuate, in some cases materially, in response to changes in the Portfolio\'s NAV, the intra-day value of holdings, and supply and demand for Shares. The Adviser cannot predict whether Shares will trade above, below or at their NAV. may pay significantly more or receive significantly less than the Fund’s NAV per share during periods when there is a significant premium or discount. Buying or selling Shares in the secondary market may require paying brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. New Fund Risk. A new portfolio\'s performance may not represent how the portfolio is expected to or may perform in the long term. In addition, there is a limited operating history for investors to evaluate and the portfolio may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Flowserve as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.153. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The financial scales have tipped monthly costs in favor of renting over buying, but it does not bring the benefit of housing wealth gains over time that owning does and movers should consider their long-term housing plans and personal situation as they make this decision.""', 'The overall advantage of renting continues to grow in most marketsIn February, the cost of buying a starter home in the top 50 metros was $1,027 (60.1%) higher than renting one; comparatively, the cost to buy was $865 higher than renting in February 2023 – a $162 higher monthly savings from renting compared to the prior year. The savings are mostly driven by declining rent prices and higher buying costs, especially interest rates – the 30-year fixed mortgage rate remained elevated at 6.78% in February 2024 compared to 6.26% 12 months ago.', 'The advantages of renting have become more pronounced across the top metros. Looking specifically at the top 10 metros that favor renting over buying, the average monthly costs for buying a starter home were $1,950 (95.6%) higher than rents – nearly double the cost. Those metros are mostly markets with a higher concentration of tech workers and high earners, where both the average rent and buy costs are higher than the national average.', 'Renting beats buying in all major metros, especially in south and west; five metros flip from last yearIn February, median rents fell across all unit sizes. Despite seven months of annual rent declines, median rents are still $252 (17.3%) higher than the same time in 2020, before the onset of the pandemic. Last February, 45 metros favored renting, but over the past 12 months Memphis, Tenn, Birmingham, Ala., Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Baltimore metros flipped from favoring buying to favoring renting. Four out of five of those markets were among the top markets seeing a high share of investor activity, which may have accelerated the growth of home prices there and increased the overall costs of buying a home, tilting those markets further toward favoring renting over buying.', 'Austin, Texas, where the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $3,695 – 141.5% more than the monthly rent of $1,530, for a monthly savings of $2,165 – topped the list of markets most favoring renting. Other top markets favoring renting over buying were Seattle, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

51,70b0f6a7-4d89-36b4-872e-dd56eebd122d,MSFT,2024-03-26,13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-affordable-tech-stocks-123733082.html,1711456653,STORY,"['MRAM', '^GSPC', 'MGIC', 'VPG', 'CINT']","['In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best affordable tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', ""On January 29, Fidelity Investments issued its outlook for the technology sector for 2024 and beyond. According to Fidelity, tech's performance in 2024 will depend on the macro environment to a certain extent. The outlook report noted that in 2023, tech finished the race as the top performer among all market sectors, a position it continued to occupy till late January of 2024, when it still outperformed the S&P 500. The biggest contributor to this has been coming from artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'Despite this, some financial professionals find it difficult to hop on the tech stock wagon, believing that most tech stocks are overpriced. For instance, on February 6, Bloomberg reported that Amundi SA, Europe\'s biggest fund manager, believes that the optimism in tech stocks is misplaced, resulting in the fund manager refraining from joining the ""big tech stocks frenzy."" Additionally, analysts at Bank of America Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been drawing parallels between the price levels of tech stocks today and the dot-com era bubble. As is the case with any bubble, it may be the case that this AI bubble, too, will soon burst.', 'While this skepticism is also rising, many investors are still attracted to tech. On January 29, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, appeared on Bloomberg Radio to discuss this. His reasoning for tech stocks remaining an attractive investment is based on the following factors:', '""They have annuity-like businesses, they have pricing power, and they have global brands... the market views them as the stocks they go to. It\'s the all-weather stock.""', 'Thus, the debate on whether investors should rush to buy tech stocks or avoid them for the moment continues. For those looking to buy into tech, there are some key areas they should look out for.', 'According to Fidelity, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and cloud computing are the main areas to look at in the tech sector for investors today. Semiconductor companies have been investing in AI with increasing fervor since the launch of ChatGPT and, in some cases, even before then. The rise of AI has actually propelled semiconductor companies to greater heights since the use of their chips in AI applications has become practically essential. In the case of cloud computing, dedicated tech investors will know that this area of tech has been around and been popular for a long time. With companies and enterprises swiftly moving their data and workloads to the cloud, companies offering cloud-based software are gaining and retaining investor attention and money.', ""All in all, tech may be a sector with a bright future. According to Deloitte's 2024 Technology Industry Outlook, global IT investments in 2024 are expected to see double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services. Additionally, analyst estimates show that public cloud spending will grow by over 20% this year, with AI investments also significantly contributing to increased overall spending growth for tech. Deloitte's outlook noted that by 2025, AI-related investments may reach $200 billion globally, with the US leading in this area."", ""Considering the above, big-tech companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are considered to be the best investment picks this year. However, these companies are far from affordable for many investors, including many new investors. This is especially the case considering the skepticism concerning the perceived overvaluation of tech stocks in the market today. Hence, cheaper tech stocks with immense potential in today's market may be an excellent place to start your tech investment.

That was up 5% from the prior year, setting a new record. ', 'The leading dividend payers might come as a surprise. Tech titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) led the way in dividend payments last year. They\'re part of the much-lauded ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which are more known for their ability to deliver outsize stock price appreciation than income. Here\'s a look at their dividend outlays last year and where some of their Magnificent Seven rivals stand as dividend stocks.', 'Microsoft paid $20.7 billion in dividends last year, leading the globe in that category. That massive outlay enabled the technology giant to reclaim the top spot among dividend payers, a title it last held in 2020. Microsoft was second in 2021 and held third place in 2022 after falling behind Australian mining giant BHP Group, which led the way in those two years. BHP Group fell to sixth last year due to the variable nature of its dividend, which ties the payout to its commodity price-driven profits. Meanwhile, Microsoft has increased its dividend per share by 10% in each of the past two years. ', 'The tech titan can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. Over the past six months, it has generated $49.4 billion in net cash from operations. It paid $10.6 billion in dividends and repurchased another $8.8 billion of its shares. Meanwhile, it ended last year with $81 billion of cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet against $74.2 billion of total debt. ', ""Microsoft's strong balance sheet and enormous and growing cash flows have enabled it to steadily increase its dividend. With ample growth catalysts, including massive investments in video games and AI, with its purchase of Activision and its investment in OpenAI, Microsoft should be able to continue paying more money in dividends in the coming years."", 'Apple came in second to Microsoft in dividend payments last year at $14.9 billion, putting it right behind oil giant ExxonMobil. The company increased its dividend per share by 4% last year, its 11th straight year of increasing the payout. ', 'Like Microsoft, Apple can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. It produced $39.9 billion in cash from operating activities in its fiscal first quarter of 2024. That easily covered its $3.8 billion dividend outlay in the period. Apple also repurchased a massive $20.1 billion in stock during that quarter. Meanwhile, like Microsoft, Apple has a cash-rich balance sheet. It ended 2023 with $172.6 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against $108 billion of debt. Given its monster cash flows and financial strength, Apple could easily overtake Microsoft as the top dividend payer in the future. ', 'Of the companies in the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the only other member to pay dividends last year. The semiconductor giant paid $395 million in dividends, which is paltry compared to Apple and Microsoft. It plans to maintain that level in its current fiscal year. ', ""However, it's not due to a lack of free cash flow. The company is cashing in on the AI boom. Its free cash flow skyrocketed in fiscal 2024 to an eye-popping $26.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023. It's using that money to buy back stock. It repurchased $9.5 billion in fiscal 2024 and aims to tap the remaining $22.5 billion of its existing authorization by the end of its current fiscal year. "", ""The group will have at least one more dividend payer this year. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) initiated a dividend earlier this year. The social media giant will pay about $5 billion in dividends this year at its initial rate. It can easily afford that outlay. It's about 12% of its annual free cash flow, and a similar percentage of the cash currently sitting on its balance sheet. "", 'Other Magnificent Seven members could join Meta Platforms as meaningful dividend payers in the future. Search giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) certainly has the financial resources to pay dividends. It produced over $100 billion in net cash from operating activities in its last fiscal year, roughly 60% of which it returned to shareholders through repurchases. Like its rivals, Alphabet could pay a dividend while repurchasing a meaningful amount of shares each year. ', 'Technology giants generate massive amounts of free cash flow. Microsoft and Apple are using a big chunk of that money to pay dividends, enabling them to lead the world in that category last year. Many of their Magnificent Seven peers also produce prodigious amounts of cash that they could pay out in dividends in the future. That could enable investors in the sector to collect even more income to go along with the stock price appreciation potential these top growth stocks offer.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away."", 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft ', 'Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, Microsoft has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.', ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Microsoft shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 41% to 45%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.', ""Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""Owing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.1b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.03% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Microsoft's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Microsoft's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Microsoft that you need to be mindful of."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Apple ceded the top spot to Microsoft, which now rules the roost with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Nvidia moved quickly up the charts to assume the No. 3 spot behind Apple with a market cap of $2.3 trillion, spurred on by its gold-standard AI chips. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with their own AI solutions -- are also members of this prestigious fraternity."", ""With Palantir Technologies' (NYSE: PLTR) market cap of just $54 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like a longshot to suggest that it is vying for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI and the company's expertise in the field suggest the odds are likely in Palantir's favor."", ""It wasn't very long ago that Palantir was relatively unknown outside of government agency circles. The data mining and AI specialist worked closely with the intelligence community in the U.S. to ferret out terrorists and prevent attacks before they happened. Palantir soon expanded beyond its original mandate, creating sophisticated built-to-order AI models for other government agencies and enterprises, helping discover valuable insights hidden deep within their data."", ""Palantir sprung into action when the market for generative AI exploded early last year, putting decades of expertise to work and developing a solution that could be broadly applied. The fruit of those labors is the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), the company's home-grown generative AI system, which Palantir developed in a matter of months. However, it's the company's go-to-market strategy that is spurring the greatest demand."", 'To capitalize on the opportunity, Palantir is holding boot camps. ""These immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations,"" management wrote in the company\'s fourth-quarter business update. Attendance at these sessions has been off the charts, as businesses have the opportunity to increase productivity or solve their most pressing business problems using generative AI solutions.', 'In October, Palantir laid out plans to hold 500 boot camps over the coming year. The company has since ""blown that goal out of the water,"" completing over 560 boot camps for 465 organizations in just four months.', ""That strong and growing demand is driving robust financial results. In the fourth quarter, Palantir's revenue of $608 million climbed 20% year over year and 9% sequentially. The biggest contributor was U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 70%, driven by demand for AIP. Palantir delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of profitability, making it eligible to join the S&P 500 index, which some market watchers believe that will happen this year."", ""It was management's outlook that really turned heads, as the company is forecasting at least 40% growth for the U.S. commercial segment -- which includes AIP -- over the coming year."", ""Palantir is in a unique position among AI providers. The company has a long history of AI expertise and a solid track record of fulfilling government contracts. That gives Palantir an edge in providing AI solutions to the U.S. government and its allies, and many believe the quest for sovereign AI among nations has already begun. Add to that the vast potential within enterprise businesses and the opportunity becomes clear -- but it won't happen overnight."", 'According to Wall Street, Palantir is poised to generate revenue of $2.71 billion in 2024 and $3.23 billion by 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 16. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to grow its revenue to roughly $60 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Revenue grew by 20% year over year in the most recent quarter. At that rate, it would take 16 years for Palantir to reach the $1 trillion threshold.', 'However, its U.S. commercial business -- fueled by generative AI -- grew by 70% in Q4, and management is guiding for at least 40% growth for the segment, so it could soon eclipse its other sales. Palantir has a tendency to under promise and over-deliver, so that estimate could well be conservative. If the company grew its revenue closer to 40%, it could be worth $1 trillion or more within a decade.', ""Estimates regarding generative AI are growing by leaps and bounds, but it's estimated the market will be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company."", ""If Palantir captures just a small part of that large and growing opportunity, it won't be long before it has secured membership in the $1 trillion club."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

All 171 passengers survived, as did six crew members.', 'The DOJ is reportedly looking into whether events leading to that failure violated the terms of a deferred criminal prosecution agreement it reached with Boeing in 2021 to settle criminal charges connected to two 737 Max 8 aircraft crashes that killed 346 people at the end of the last decade.', 'Investigators concluded the crashes were caused by Boeing’s lack of transparency about a new aircraft maneuvering system on the Max called “MCAS.” Boeing admitted that two employees misled the FAA about that system.', 'The department agreed to set aside criminal responsibility so long as Boeing fulfilled the terms of the three-year accord. But if it concludes Boeing violated that pact, the jet maker could face prosecution on the original count of defrauding the US.', 'Boeing’s accumulated lapses — which include recent violations of US export laws — are giving prosecutors less and less wiggle room to handle Boeing with kid gloves, said Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor and white-collar criminal defense attorney.', 'He argues the door plug mishap is enough to charge Boeing.', '""The simple question is: Why would you not criminally prosecute Boeing?"" Frenkel said.', 'The challenge for the Justice Department in considering a guilty plea or prosecution is that a criminal conviction could potentially disqualify Boeing from certain government business — a devastating economic blow for a giant American manufacturer.', 'Boeing also faces new pressure from regulators to improve standards within its manufacturing plants and those of its suppliers.', 'While that work happens, its overseers are limiting Boeing’s production of new 737s.', 'The job of investigating exactly what transpired on Jan. 5 falls to the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency that discovered preliminary evidence that the four bolts were missing from the door plug that blew open during that flight.', 'NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told a Senate panel that Boeing had failed to cooperate in its probe and hadn’t provided the names of employees who worked on the Alaska Airlines jet, nor had it provided documentation on how the work was performed.', 'Boeing did later provide the names but also admitted it had no record of the work on the Max 9 panel that blew off in midair.', 'The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, is taking a deep look at Boeing’s quality controls.

As it turns out, shoppers still like the in-store experience. Although there are plenty of ways to buy clothes online, consumers still want to touch the merchandise or try it on.', 'According to Census Bureau data, despite inflation flaring up again retail sales continued to climb.

Comparable store sales were up 6% for the chain in 2023, and Abercrombie’s comps soared 28% from the year-ago period.', 'That meshes nicely with Abercrombie’s decision to move away from the teen demographic with more office, special occasion and active apparel. The retailer reported massive earnings growth last year as profits of $335 million last year annihilated the prior year’s earnings of $10.4 million. Having found its groove again, ANF stock remains a top-tier retail stock to buy.', 'Source: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.com', 'Gap Stores (NYSE:GPS) is another extraordinary turnaround story.

The results aren’t blowout numbers like its rival but rather incremental changes showing Gap may be getting back on track.', 'Even with an extra selling week in 2023, Gap sales were down 5% for the year. Comps were off 2%. The real gains were made in profit margins where gross margins widened by 450 basis points (bps) from a year ago, and merchandise margins were 490 bps higher.', 'Still, the Banana Republic chain and the once-hot Athleta brand remain a drag. Comps were down 7% and 12% for the year, respectively. While Old Navy was also off 1% for 2023, in the fourth quarter comps rose 2%, indicating the brand may be on the right track once more.

The lingerie line launched a new activewear brand called Offline by Aerie. The retailer sees Aerie becoming a $2 billion brand within a few years. With the help of Offline, the company notched $1.6 billion in sales in 2023.', 'AEO stock CEO Jay Schottenstein sees the retailer itself generating $6 billion in sales within three years. He told analysts, “We are at an inflection point in our journey, having undergone a huge cultural transformation over the past year to align our strategy and priorities towards delivering consistent, profitable growth. From here, we are focused on execution and we know we are set up for success.”', 'Having right-sized its business and only focusing on its core growth opportunities, AEO stock still has lots of room to run.', 'Source: Konmac / Shutterstock.com', 'If you’re sensing a trend in retailers undergoing a turnaround, then you won’t be surprised to find Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) on the list. Although its namesake store is still a problem and a heavy drag on performance, the rest of Urban Outfitter’s brands are exhibiting strong growth. They’ve overcome the pressure created by the parent chain to lift the company.', 'In particular, the Free People and Anthropologie brands are URBN stock’s biggest assets in terms of locking up growth. They saw comps north of 21% and 12%, respectively, last year whereas Urban Outfitters was down nearly 14%. It seems to have suffered the fate of retailers like Abercrombie and Gap where its primary apparel brand fell out of favor with its target demographic of teens and young adults. Urban Outfitters might need a makeover to make its brand resonate with consumers again.', 'The company seems to focus on e-commerce, which means its margins will be under pressure as it must compete on price. And because it has a wholesale segment selling its clothes in department stores, consumers have options if they want to buy its apparel. That may ultimately hold back growth as margins remain under pressure.', 'Urban Outfitters has experimented with new verticals such as its Nuuly clothing rental and a resale business, but that is struggling too.

Although management raised its outlook for the year, it was not the robust increase many investors were anticipating. Analysts had already expected a raise to come and were pegging their own estimates above the prior guidance. When Lululemon essentially just met those forecasts, it was a letdown.', 'Lululemon Athletica also faces new competition from the likes of Nike (NYSE:NKE) and others. Nike began offering leggings a year ago, challenging Lululemon on cost, fit and quality. Those were the compelling competitive advantages and could be a serious threat.', 'Still, Lululemon’s customer base is fairly loyal to the company, which gives it an edge over rivals.

Victoria’s Secret’s flirtation with larger size offerings has been a disaster, and the stock is down 40% over the past year. The company is abandoning inclusiveness by returning to its “sexy” roots with fashions targeting swim, sport and active apparel. Torrid, on the other hand, is staying true to its target demographic and is up 47%.', 'Yet, this is a recent turnaround for Torrid, whose stock is down 85% from its 2021 IPO. Much of that is due to the retailer putting a premium price on its merchandise when consumers were in a discounting mode. It kept profits afloat but hurt net sales. The plus-size leader is now changing that by offering better value while opening more stores and improving efficiency.', 'Arguably, one potential speed bump for CURV stock is the widespread use of weight-loss pills such as Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy and more recently Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound. The massive success of the drugs in causing weight loss may be a future headwind for the company.', 'Torrid was the plus-sized alternative to the goth-inspired Hot Topic back in the day, so it’s always had those consumers at the heart of its DNA. CURV stock can still gain from that market’s demand for good-fitting clothes. Its renewed aim to improve operations should pay off in time.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Not a retailer but shopping mall operator Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is also proving the naysayers wrong.

Its venues are Class A locations and it boasts 95% occupancy rates. If retail is dead then the malls are dying, but Simon’s malls suggest the opposite.', 'Because the REIT’s malls typically cater to affluent shoppers, they are usually the last to feel the effects of any economic downturn. And because recessions are often measured in months while bull markets go on for years, the ill effects of a crash may be over before Simon ever reaches the point of ever experiencing a pullback. While Class B and C malls are closing, Class A malls like Simon’s are growing.', 'As a REIT, Simon also pays out most of its profits as a dividend, which currently yields over 5% annually.

Currently, one-third of positions that previously mandated only a high-school diploma now require a four-year college degree, with one in four roles that once sought a bachelor’s degree now demanding a master’s. Concurrently, 75% of Americans perceive higher education as financially unattainable.\xa0', 'CEOs without degrees get to leadership roles through different avenues. Firstly, many arose from within their respective industries or companies, possessing specialized knowledge and extensive experience in their niche domains. Secondly, they demonstrate exceptional performance, particularly prevalent in sectors like sales where achievements are quantifiable and conspicuous. Lastly, they excel in assembling talented teams, relying on their insights and expertise to drive success.', 'The relationship between undergraduate degrees and CEO success varies across industries. While tech sectors often require specialized education, other industries show a broader range of educational backgrounds among CEOs. The significance of pursuing a BA, BS, or BBA in attaining CEO positions remains unclear beyond industry-specific norms.\xa0', ""In analyzing the educational backgrounds of Fortune 100 CEOs, it's evident that undergraduate degrees play an important role in shaping career trajectories. The most common degrees among CEOs are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), with 53% holding one of these degrees, while 47% have Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees. Notably, 45% of those with BS degrees pursued business-related fields rather than traditional science or engineering disciplines."", 'It is also worth highlighting that among the 2023 Fortune 100 CEOs, merely 11.8% obtained undergraduate degrees from Ivy League schools, with even fewer holding Ivy League MBAs.

Furthermore, the prevalence of CEOs from public universities, such as Tim Cook of Apple Inc (NASDSAQ:AAPL) and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, highlights the accessibility of success beyond Ivy League corridors.', ""Nevertheless, tech industry CEOs predominantly hold undergraduate degrees directly related to engineering.

Last month, Disney said it would merge Star — once viewed as a crown jewel — with Indian telecom giant Reliance Industries in a joint venture estimated to be worth $8.5 billion. Disney will be a minority shareholder in the entity.', 'The decision highlights the challenges posed by the Indian entertainment market despite its allure of growth, multiple analysts told Yahoo Finance. While India offers the opportunity to reach millions of viewers, competition is fierce and success requires a significant amount of investment that US media companies may not be prepared to make as they grapple with cord-cutting challenges domestically.', 'India, which boasts a population of more than 1.4 billion, has become a media hotspot with projected TV and streaming-related revenue growth of 11% in 2024. That compares with much more muted growth in other developing countries, according to analytics firm Ampere Analysis.', 'But the market has been a hard one for US media companies to crack. First of all, it’s difficult for companies to create a direct relationship with Indian consumers, who largely rely on mobile operators to gain access to streaming services due to limited broadband infrastructure.', 'Indian consumers also have a relatively low willingness to pay for streaming platforms thanks to free, ad-supported models from local content providers and rampant piracy.', ""Local content providers — the top four being Star India, Viacom18, Sony, and Zee Entertainment — have largely been able to service India's vast population, which spans many different languages and dialects.

I'd think twice about this course of action. Here's why."", ""Tesla's ongoing challenges have been widely publicized. The business reported 3.5% revenue growth in Q4. That was a major slowdown compared to previous years. It points to the higher-rate environment that discourages consumers from wanting to buy new cars. This situation makes monthly payments more expensive."", ""But Tesla's decelerating revenue demonstrates the competitive nature of the EV industry as well. There are numerous rivals all focused heavily on EV investments, hoping to boost manufacturing capacity and launch new models. This means Tesla will have its work cut out for it going forward."", ""Consequently, the business must compete aggressively on price. Over the past couple years, Elon Musk and his team haven't shied away from lowering prices on its range of cars on many different occasions to support demand and maintain market share. The result has been contracting margins, which no investor wants to see."", ""It's not a surprise that shareholders have rushed for the exits. Tesla's financials have taken a hit. And the stock is down big, now trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. That valuation is certainly cheaper than it was just three months ago."", ""Investors who are considering buying the stock need to ask if Tesla's latest struggles are temporary or permanent. If you believe they're the former, then adding shares to your portfolio looks like a smart move. But this might not be the case."", 'After reporting two straight quarters of subscriber losses at the start of 2022, Netflix shares took a beating.

Investors were worried about the weak digital ad market pressuring sales growth, as well as crushed margins due to heavy metaverse spending. ', 'Both Netflix and Meta have absolutely skyrocketed since those lows, thanks mainly to stronger business performance and a favorable market backdrop.', ""Tesla bulls will quickly point to how the EV maker's current situation mimics these two leading internet companies. It's easy to be skeptical about this stance, though."", ""For starters, Tesla's current valuation is astronomically higher than where Meta and Netflix traded at during their low points in 2022. You can argue that Tesla has much greater growth potential, but that would imply lofty expectations about the future, with the hopes that EV sales will catapult higher in an interest rate environment that's not as supportive as it was during the 2010s."", ""Investors are probably also pricing it the probability that Tesla will introduce fully autonomous vehicles, or that it will start selling humanoid robots to other companies, or that its energy ambitions will take off. This stuff is unpredictable, but it's likely reflected in the valuation."", 'Meta and Netflix were and are still the clear leaders in industries whose competitive dynamics have already largely played out. Netflix had the most subscribers of any streaming service, with impressive profitability and unit economics. Meta, on the other hand, had billions of daily active users and a global network effect. Once industry and macro conditions improved, these companies got back to their positive trajectories.', ""The EV market is less established.

And also, raising the price target by $40 to $135 a share."", 'Currently, shares are trading around $120.

We also have a few other tailwinds, such as the strike ending, the Hulu consolidation, continued cost cuts. And the analyst here sees that that's going to be more impactful down the line as, really, Disney commits to this turnaround plan."", ""Now, part of the turnaround plan has been pressured by activist investors.

That also part of this call that's out there too."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So Citi has a call. They're raising their estimates to reflect stronger subscriber growth. And raising its price target from $555 a share to $660 a share. It's going to maintain its neutral rating."", ""Now, Netflix has been really trying to move away from subscriber ads. And they've been putting the emphasis more on the ad-supported tier along with the password sharing crackdown. So they see that as the key drivers moving ahead here."", ""And Citi really sees more room to run on the subscriber front. And if you think of the recent programming that Netflix has put out there, it's been very successful, especially, when we think about international too. For full-year 2024, they're actually going to invest more internationally. They're really emphasizing localized content than domestically."", ""And that's having a boon, really, when you think about overseas growth and the potential to reach subscribers that are maybe in markets not as mature as the North American market."", ""So a lot of these streaming companies, these media companies, they are putting out their next phases of growth. And it seems like analysts are pretty bullish that as we see that play out, it's going to have a significant impact on the stock price in the bottom lines of these companies.""]"

To me, I\'m watching that entire sector and saying where the US consumer is shopping, that\'s the sector I want to watch because that tells me where we spend our dollars has the most sustainability in the long run and today more than ever, the dollar value sector is grabbing a more lion\'s share of the US consumer than ever before.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Some of America's best known retailers are struggling to stay relevant in the last month. Macy's announced it's closing 150 stores despite this retail openings outweighed closures last year, and consumer spending has held up. Naveen Jaggi is JLL America's president of retail, joins us here on set. It's good to talk to you today."", ""We were talking about this morning, about when you think about where retail is headed, a lot of department stores may be looking for a smaller footprint, more localized footprint. Talk to me about what it is that you're seeing in this environment."", ""NAVEEN JAGGI: Well, I think what we're seeing is a big shift in the way consumers spend, right. So the days of the big department store anchored malls have a place in America, but we don't need to see as many of those big department stores because consumers have found a way to find what they want at a much closer location to their home."", ""And it's not surprising if you think about the way Macy's is saying that their future growth is in the 30,000 square foot space. That's what they claim, that they're going to have a big effort in that level, which says to them, look, we know that there's Burlington, TJX, and those kinds of brands that are capturing a lion's share of the US consumer dollar, more than ever before. That's where they can use their scale and their buying power to meet that demand."", ""So, it makes good sense for them to pivot. And as we also saw from Nordstrom's. What have they said recently? Nordstrom's rack is the biggest brand for them to drive their growth. They've taken their focus off the Department store. So the Department stores have a place, but I think the reality is more of these value oriented retail spaces in the 30,000 square foot space makes the most sense because that's where consumers want to go."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Are there any, when you look across kind of the retail landscape, are there certain names that you pay more attention to than others, certain bellwethers that you consider for the sector?', ""NAVEEN JAGGI: Yeah, so, if we're talking about that one particular-- call it daily goods value sector, right, so if you want to talk about brands such as TJX and now Burlington. I mean, it's fascinating to watch a group like Burlington. Five years ago, Burlington was the Burlington Coat Factory. It was not really known as a value player against TJX or Ross. Today, they're having over 60 stores a year, and they're taking 50, 60, 70,000ft in some cases."", ""So to me, I'm watching that entire sector and saying, where are the US consumer shopping? That's the sector I want to watch because that tells me where we spend our dollars has the most sustainability in the long run. And today more than ever, the dollar value sector is grabbing a more lion's share of the US consumer than ever before. I'm watching that sector, whether it's grocery or soft goods."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Is there something to be said also about the payoff that the buy in that you get at some of these discount stores in a physical store?', 'NAVEEN JAGGI: Absolutely.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: If you think about a Nordstrom or Macy's, you don't necessarily have to go into the store. I mean, I say that as somebody who shops online a lot, but when you go into a TJX store, you ultimately are going there to sort through things to be able to find the best value. I mean, that, is that a big part of--"", 'NAVEEN JAGGI: The thrill of the find-- we know that TJX, for example, will go out and find a lot of these very high demand department store type of product, but you can get a much smaller location. So the thrill of the seek, the search, the find, that makes it the adventure. None of those brands have a very large presence online. They have somewhat of a presence, but they actually want you to come inside.', ""So, as opposed to buying a crock pot or buying a dress online through Macy's and picking it up, which is certainly right for a big part of the American public, the adventure and finding it at a value, that's what seems to work for a lot of Americans today more than ever. And that's why I think Aldi and other brands have done the same thing. Come to the store, find a bargain you won't find anywhere else for a limited time. Get it now before it's gone."", ""JOSH LIPTON: I want to get, Naveen, also your broad take on the US consumer right now. I think they've actually surprised a lot of people with just how resilient they are, but what are you seeing now, Naveen, and what do you see looking ahead?"", 'NAVEEN JAGGI: Well, I think the US consumer has shocked everybody. Back in the holiday season, right, they were projected to do about 4.4 per year sales over 23, over 22-- 5.6% over year over year. That tells you this consumer is a lot stronger than everybody says. So to me, the US consumer will remain strong as long as we have low labor. So, right now unemployment level is what, 3.7, 3.8, right?', 'Wages are up, or at least better than they were five, six, seven years ago. So to me, as long as the US consumer feels strong, market is up, so therefore it wants to feel better than it did a year ago. All of this gives them confidence to go shopping. So, as long as the US consumer continues to shop, and they have shown no indication to pull back on shopping, we will see a healthy retail environment.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Part of that is also execution though, right. And when you think about it, I mean, the consumer is not all the same. And when you think about where the retailers have been, those that have been able to stay ahead are those that have really executed on very specific needs that the consumer has had.', ""NAVEEN JAGGI: So retailers-- the ones who've really got it figured out, which is to give the consumer what they want and execute it really well. So, we were talking about this a while ago with Lululemon. What a great brand. I mean, they've been on a run for the past three or four years. They're a hot streak, right. They execute what they have and what they make very, very well. They know exactly what the Lulu consumer wants."", ""And so what do we see now? We see Alo Yoga, Beyond Yoga. We see other brands coming in and trying to nip at their heels, but the ones who nail it really well, Dollar General and the Dollar Sector, they do it really, really well. There's many of these what I call brand killers. They execute so well. The US consumer is so loyal to them. They know whatever they do, the consumer follows."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Loyalty certainly significant.', 'NAVEEN JAGGI: Absolutely.', 'AKIKO FUJITA: Naveen Jaggi, good to talk to you today.

CTO recently announced the acquisition of Marketplace at Seminole Towne Center, a premier retail destination in the Sanford submarket of Orlando, FL. The purchase of this 318,000-square-foot multi-tenant retail power center was made for $68.7 million, and the move aligns with the company\'s strategy to enhance its presence in high-growth markets.Strategically located on 41 acres along I-4 and SR 417, Seminole Towne Center benefits from its proximity to downtown Orlando and strong community ties. The property enjoys a 98% occupancy rate and boasts a diverse mix of tenants. Particularly, it is anchored by Burlington BURL, Marshalls of TJX Companies TJX, Ross Dress for Less ROST, Ulta Beauty and Five Below, among others. This ensures a stable rental income stream.Its location within the Orlando Metropolitan Statistical Area, a top-ranked market per The Urban Land Institute, positions it well for long-term value creation. With a three-mile population of more than 60,000 and an average household income of approximately $118,000, this property acquisition seems a strategic buy for CTO Realty Growth with significant growth potential. With this move, Orlando has now emerged as the company’s fourth-largest market.John P. Albright, the president and CEO of CTO Realty Growth, Inc., highlighted the strategic importance of this acquisition, stating, ""This dominant, Target shadow-anchored center allows us to increase our exposure to the high-growth Orlando market and existing top tenants such as Ross Dress for Less, TJX Companies, and Burlington.”Further, he noted that “Seminole Towne Center provides a stable income stream and growth potential, and due to its prime location and strong community ties, we see attractive potential upside from below-market rents. We believe we acquired the property below replacement cost.”The property was purchased through a 1031 like-kind exchange using $24.1 million of restricted cash generated from the company’s prior completed property dispositions. Also, CTO used available cash and draws from its unsecured revolving credit facility. A portion of the acquisition was structured as a reverse-like-kind exchange. This financing approach underscores the company’s strategy of prudent financial management while pursuing growth opportunities.Recently, CTO Realty Growth disclosed its leasing accomplishments for the year-to-date period, signifying healthy growth and promising prospects in the retail real estate sector.CTO unveiled its leasing achievements from the beginning of the year through Mar 11, which include the signing of 16 leases totaling an impressive 112,480 square feet at an average cash base rent of $27.49 per square foot.Particularly noteworthy is the company\'s substantial comparable growth, evidenced by the signing of 12 leases totaling 103,065 square feet at an average cash base rent of $26.58 per square foot. This represents a staggering 89% increase compared to the previous average cash base rent, highlighting CTO\'s adeptness in enhancing value across its portfolio.Moreover, the company\'s expansion endeavors have been evident in its recent openings, including Politan Row and Culinary Dropout at Ashford Lane in Atlanta, GA, Ainsworth at Shops of Legacy in Plano, TX, and Fogo de Chão at West Broad Village in Richmond, VA. These strategic moves align with CTO\'s commitment to curating vibrant retail destinations in high-growth markets across the United States.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And specifically, what you like David, gold and silver."", ""Your first reason here, Dave. Let's walk through these points. When you look at the gold market, what you see is that it hit an all-time high. And importantly, you say it stayed above there."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah, that's right. So since 2020, there's been four different times that we have, you know, neared these all-time highs, but not broken above. Really big deal here on March 8, we broke above. And so, as we've broken above those levels, that means that there's more room to the upside."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Got it. Second point here, Dave. When you look at the gold market, what you're pointing out is-- you think what was a ceiling is now actually a new foundation."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: That's right. When we break above 2100, and then stay above, especially as a week lows, that has now become our new foundation, or floor. And so, I don't think that we're going to be going below 2100 from this point forward. It's just up from here."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Got it. And finally, talk about the role of central bankers.', ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: OK. So ultimately, the reason why the prices have been going up is not because advisors have been allocating instead of 60/40 portfolios into gold. There's not even 1% allocated there."", ""The reason why it's been going up is because of central bankers like China that have been buying thousands of tons of gold on an annualized basis. Now China doesn't do anything in secret. They're ultimately trying to let everyone know here that this is something that they think is very important. And they're buying thousands of tons of it."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Now-- so those are three reasons. Before everybody piles in, David, what would be-- our viewers are thinking about making a move into this metal. What would be the risks that you would point out?', ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Well, because the US dollar prices gold-- you know, our-- the dollar is ultimately-- if it gets stronger, that means that the value of gold goes down. But what we're seeing right now is inflation still continuing to rise. And so, the opposite is actually the case. Gold has gone up while the US dollar has actually lost some of its purchasing power."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. So let's turn to what you don't like here, David. So let's-- and let's talk bonds, specifically the AGG. Let's go through those reasons as well. Your chief point-- your first point here is frankly, our expectations of when the Fed's going to cut and by how much, they've been shifting."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah. If you just even look at the price movement this year alone, we started out the year with six Fed cuts priced in. Now we're looking at maybe a couple. I think that that might even go down to zero, if inflation continues to peak up."", ""And so, ultimately, if you own bonds, there's a seesaw effect. If interest rates rise, the value of bonds go down. This is a part of the reason why so much has been lost in bond portfolios, AGG specifically, over the last three years were actually negative. Still 316 this morning."", ""JOSH LIPTON: You're in good company, by the way. You've seen some noted economists, by the way, also telling their clients, we think there's increasing chances of no cuts. Your second point here. Let's just talk about yield."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah. So, you know, if the yield on the AGG is 3.3%, that's one of the reasons why you would own it is that you could get paid. Now the challenge is today that they have to compete with US treasuries that are not only safer, but even on the shorter duration."", ""So less of that swing risk there with the interest rate movement. You can actually get a better rate of return. And so, I think that a lot of the corporate bonds right now just don't even look nearly as attractive as the safest place yielding higher shorter duration."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Finally, the reason you would steer clear, or you just talk about frankly refinancing costs.', ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah, that's right. So ultimately, we're looking at a world right now where corporate debt is having to re-metabolize this debt at double the cost of what it was, you know, here in, you know, 2019, 2021, when every good CFO, you know, got as much debt as possible. And now, they're at this point after five-year terms that they're going to have to refinance this."", ""And so, everyone wants lower rates. Greater liquidity in the banks.

It is not very likely that the Fed is going to be able to reduce rates in a meaningful way, unless something significantly breaks, which would actually be pointing to AGG.

And the most important detail from all of that is: Bahrain is an island.', 'So why is Bahrain wanting to buy 50 main battle tanks from General Dynamics (NYSE: GD)?', 'I admit that\'s the first question that leapt to mind after learning last week that the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (the foreign arms sales division of the Pentagon) has notified Congress of a Bahraini request to buy 50 Abrams tanks, along with 28 assorted support vehicles (tank recovery vehicles, breacher vehicles, and bridge-layers). And I have to say that DSCA\'s announcement is pretty silent on that point -- aside from blandly observing that the tanks ""will improve Bahrain\'s capability to meet current and future threats.""', 'What it does say is why the U.S. State Department approves of the arms sale: to ""support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally."" This suggests that, for whatever reason Bahrain wants the tanks, it\'s probably going to get them.', 'DSCA also confirms for us the total value of the arms package -- $2.2 billion -- and identifies the several defense contractors who will benefit: BAE Systems, Honeywell, Leonardo DRS, Lockheed Martin, RTX -- and General Dynamics itself, of course, the primary beneficiary of the sale.', 'It may interest investors, however, to know that the money is probably the least significant aspect of this deal to General Dynamics.', 'To understand why, you need to travel back nearly a decade, to 2016.', 'Despite more than a decade of helping America fight a ""Global War on Terror,"" General Dynamics\' marquee Combat Systems division -- responsible for building armored vehicles -- was struggling. With no peer opponents for America to fight, and plenty of tanks already built during the Cold War, there simply wasn\'t much need to build new tanks. Year after year, a lack of new orders forced General Dynamics to contemplate mothballing its last remaining operational tank-building factory, in Lima, Ohio.', ""And no wonder. Combat Systems' revenues had been declining for seven straight years. S&P Global Market Intelligence data show that from 2009 to 2016, Combat Systems revenues shrank nearly 43%, to just $5.5 billion. The good news was that despite the dearth of work, the Combat Systems business remained profitable; the bad news was that it was clearly a business in decline."", ""It wasn't until 2017 that revenues, bolstered by massive new orders for hundreds of M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks for the armies of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, began growing again. Subsequent orders from Taiwan in 2019 and from the U.S. Army in 2022 have since added to the momentum, lifting General Dynamics Combat Systems revenue to $8.3 billion last year -- a level last seen nearly 15 years ago."", 'And now the division is set to win new work worth roughly 26.5% of the revenue it booked in all of last year. That will certainly keep the momentum going, and help General Dynamics to justify keeping its Lima plant operational for additional years into the future.', ""It won't be half bad for profits, either."", ""Revenue of $8.3 billion only makes Combat Systems General Dynamics' fourth-biggest business unit (out of four units total) by revenue, you see. But with a 13.9% operating profit margin, it's actually the company's most profitable division per revenue dollar. Put another way, for every $1 worth of revenue General Dynamics takes in from selling armored vehicles, it makes more pennies in profit than it would earn selling an equivalent dollar's-worth of military warships, cybersecurity equipment, or Gulfstream jets."", ""Turns out, General Dynamics isn't just most famous for building Abrams main battle tanks. It's also most profitable when churning out those tanks. So while we may scratch our heads in confusion, wondering why Bahrain is so keen on buying them, General Dynamics investors should just count their lucky stars that General Dynamics will get to keep selling them."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Dynamics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Dynamics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Dynamics wasn’t one of them.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.', 'Valued at $145 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide engineering, technical, design agent and planning yard support for operational strategic and attack submarines.', 'The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in Groton, CT.', 'Changes in military dynamics have led to increasing defense spending as a well-funded military can deter sudden assault by other nations. This has led to increasing spending on submarines in order to improvise and upgrade sea warfare capabilities. Looking ahead, per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2024-2029.In this context, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics’ Electric Boat unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. This unit has been building submarines since 1899 and is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of both Virginia-class attack submarines and Columbia class ballistic-missile submarines.Impressively, General Dynamics has been investing significant capital over the past several years in expanding and modernizing facilities at Electric Boat to support the growth in submarine construction. Currently, the company is working on Blocks IV and V in the Virginia-class submarine program, with 16 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. Besides, construction of the Columbia class submarines is scheduled to continue for two decades and the value of the Navy’s program of record is in excess of $115 billion.The aforementioned statistic is indicative of the solid demand that GD’s Electric Boat unit enjoys in the submarine market, which, in turn, has been enabling the company to win significant contracts like the latest one that should boost its revenue generation prospects. Considering the solid growth prospects of the global submarine market, as mentioned above, we may expect GD to continue to secure notable awards related to submarine construction and associated support provision.', 'Defense majors that are likely to gain from the expanding submarine market are Huntington Ingalls Industries HII, BAE Systems BAESY and Northrop Grumman NOC.', 'Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News (“NNS”) division is engaged in the construction, engineering, design, research and integrated planning of submarines. NNS has delivered 63 submarines to the U.S. Navy since 1960, comprised of 49 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Of the 49 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in two active service, 23 were delivered by NNS.', 'NNS is currently participating in the design and construction of the Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarines as a replacement for the current aging Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The company is a co-developer with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines.', 'BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines are the largest and most advanced attack submarines ever built for the Royal Navy. Equipped with world-leading sensors, the Astute class carries both Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles and Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes.', 'In addition to Astute, BAE Systems is also constructing the Dreadnought class submarine, which will replace the Barrow-built Vanguard class submarines to maintain the United Kingdom’s continuous at sea deterrent.', 'BAE Systems has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', ""Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 11% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'We know that Zoetis has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Zoetis will grow revenue in the future.', 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Zoetis the TSR over the last 5 years was 71%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Zoetis shareholders are up 2.2% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 11% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy.

Sunlight improves our mood, boosts immunity, and facilitates the production of vitamin D in our bodies. Furthermore, it also triggers the release of serotonin, a chemical contributing to energy, positivity, and focus. Conversely, insufficient exposure to sunlight can lead to conditions like seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and depression, which are often treated with natural or artificial light therapy. Beyond its health benefits, sunlight is also a valuable resource for generating clean and sustainable energy. When sunlight penetrates the Earth's atmosphere, its energy intensity averages 1,360 watts per square meter, surpassing the power output of common appliances like microwaves."", ""Solar energy technology uses this abundant resource, converting sunlight into thermal or electrical energy. It's increasingly favored for its cleanliness, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. For instance, a 5-kilowatt residential solar system can yield significant savings, producing over 7,500 kilowatt-hours per year under optimal conditions. These savings translate into financial benefits, with potential annual savings of over $1,500 at a typical electricity price.

In addition, its free cash flow of $10 billion came in at the high end of management's (upwardly revised) target range of $5 billion to $10 billion."", 'The question now is whether the earnings momentum can continue in 2024. Opinions are divided on the matter, but at least one Wall Street analyst thinks consensus estimates are too low for Caterpillar. If the analyst is correct, and a combination of infrastructure spending and investment related to the clean energy transition kicks in, the stock will likely go higher.', ""In addition, a lower-interest-rate environment later in the year could boost construction spending and raise commodity prices. The former would benefit Caterpillar's construction equipment sales, and the latter could encourage miners to spend more on Caterpillar's mining machinery equipment."", ""These considerations highlight the cyclical nature of Caterpillar's sales. It's not unusual for cyclical stocks to rapidly overshoot expectations in an upcycle and undershoot when the downcycle occurs. That much is understood; the tricky bit is predicting when the cycle will turn."", ""If you think rates are heading lower, commodity prices higher, and infrastructure spending -- stimulated by the $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act -- will kick in, then Caterpillar's stock may well have upside this year, even if Wall Street is pricing in flat earnings growth for 2024."", 'Daniel Foelber (Illinois Tool Works): Illinois Tool Works, commonly known as ITW, reached a new all-time high on March 21 for a very simple reason -- the story is working.', ""Plastered on the company's investor relations home page are clearly stated 2030 goals -- namely a 30% operating margin. The company continues to make progress toward that target. And the market is loving it."", 'ITW is guiding for a 25.5% to 26.5% operating margin in 2024, along with a 5% increase in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) at the midpoint of the forecast. If ITW achieves those goals, it would mark an all-time high annual operating margin and EPS.', 'The easiest way to understand where ITW is headed is to see where it has been. As you can see in the following chart, ITW has completely transformed its business from a low-margin sales focus to a high-margin profit focus.', 'Sales are down over the last 15 years, but profits have soared. Shareholders have been very happy with the shift.', 'ITW stock has increased by 235% over the last decade, and its dividend has grown at nearly the same pace. ITW beat the S&P 500 over that time frame, and reduced its share count by over a quarter thanks to buybacks.', ""Given that tech-oriented growth stocks have contributed a good chunk of the S&P 500's gains in recent years, it's impressive for an industrial conglomerate to achieve outsized returns."", ""ITW isn't a cheap stock by any means, trading at a 27.8 price-to-earnings ratio compared to 28.5 for the S&P 500. But ITW is a Dividend King with over 50 consecutive years of dividend raises. Quality often deserves a premium valuation."", 'ITW has a straightforward investment thesis. It will grow moderately while boosting efficiency with higher margins. And it will return a boatload of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.', ""If you're interested in buying Caterpillar stock at an all-time high, then ITW is definitely worth a closer look as well."", ""Scott Levine (American Water Works): Shares of American Water Works, a leading water utility, have ebbed recently, but that's not to say that the tide won't flow back in. Over the long term, American Water Works has proven to be a winner for shareholders, outperforming the market. While the S&P 500 has provided a total return of 416% over the past 20 years, American Water Works has provided a 744% total return. For patient investors looking to mitigate risk, picking up shares of American Water Works -- with their forward dividend yield of 2.4% -- is a great move."", ""Providing water and wastewater services to more than 14 million people, American Water Works is the largest regulated water utility available to investors based on market capitalization. While the company may be a boring business, it will entice conservative investors looking for investments that won't jeopardize their personal finances. Because its business is largely in regulated markets (averaging about 88% of operating revenue over the past three years), American Water Works has good foresight into future cash flows with guaranteed rates of returns."", ""Proof of this deft capital management comes in the form of its investment-grade balance sheet, which is rated by Moody's and S&P Global. This provides some reassurance that the company will meet management's target of raising the dividend at a 7% to 9% annual growth rate for the foreseeable future."", ""One of the company's proven methods for growth is acquisitions (it closed 23 acquisitions in 2023), and it seems that the company will continue pursuing this route in the near future. Currently, American Water Works has agreements related to 25 future acquisitions valued at $589 million. This has the potential to add more than 88,000 customers, and management claims it has visibility toward adding another 1.3 million customer connections in the future.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the 5 Hungriest States in the US.', 'The World Health Organization reports that there were 735 million people who faced hunger in 2022, meaning that 122 million more people were experiencing hunger from 2019 to 2022. There are many different reasons behind these staggeringly high numbers, ranging from geopolitical tensions to economic deterioration to social disparities. Given the state of the world today, food insecurity and hunger are so widespread around the globe, that nearly 10% of the global population is going hungry on an almost daily basis. (See also: 30 Hungriest Countries in the World)', 'While food insecurity is prominent in low-income countries, the United States, despite being the third richest country in the world by per capita net worth, also struggles with the global hunger issue to a notable extent. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s most recent available data, 12.8% or 17 million households in the United States experienced food insecurity in 2022. Out of these, 6.8 million households had “very low food security,” meaning they were food insecure to the extent that their normal eating patterns were disrupted and their self-reported food intake was below adequate levels.\xa0', 'While food insecurity is generally deeply linked with low wages and an increase in the price of goods, there’s more to that when it’s prevailing in an economy that is thriving and leading the world. Some other reasons that contribute to the growing food insecurity across the States include adverse social conditions, limited access to nutritious foods, housing segregation, and neighborhood disadvantages like high crime rates and poverty. ', 'Today, in some parts of the country, poverty rates are alarmingly high — the US Census Bureau reports that there were 37.9 million Americans in poverty in 2022. Although food insecurity is majorly connected with unemployment, even people with a steady income can sometimes face a temporary setback, such as a medical emergency that dries up all their savings or losing a job with no backups like how it happened during the Covid-19, leading to food insecurity.\xa0\xa0', 'Apart from temporary setbacks, some people also develop long-term chronic health conditions, which makes even the self-intake of food at adequate levels a struggle for them. As they are often medically challenged when they want to work more hours, they struggle to make enough money to afford the rent, food, and other utilities. On top of that, their chronic health condition comes with substantial medical bills, making their financial situation go from bad to worse.', 'In these challenging times, key players in the agriculture and food industry, such as Corteva Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), make efforts to help reduce food insecurity.', 'Corteva Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), one of the major American agricultural chemical and seed companies, is also known for its generous donations and giving back to community efforts. In 2021, Corteva Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) donated $125,000 to the Food Bank of Delaware Farm to help expand its food-growing capabilities in Newark city. The Food Bank Farm provides fresh vegetables and food to the local community through sales as well as donations as part of its hunger relief programs.', 'Likewise, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) also supports and funds initiatives focused on sustainable agriculture and increasing the availability of nutritional food for communities. In 2020, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) donated $10 million to Colorado State University to support and enable innovative research in sustainable agriculture and develop a diverse and highly skilled agricultural workforce.', 'On the other hand, Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), an American multinational corporation that operates in the food industry, has donated over 41 million pounds of protein valued at around $82 million to the Feeding America network since 2020.

Both these categories registered double-digit growth during the full year 2023, including an 11.9% surge in biscuits and a 14.5% increase in chocolates.In the fourth quarter, the biscuit and chocolate categories registered sales growth of 5.5% and 11.2%, respectively.

These acquisitions have not only expanded Mondelez's product offerings but also strengthened its market presence in key regions.Mondelez is committed to increasing focus on areas with higher growth potential. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company announced the sale of its developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle.

Hershey HSY signed an agreement to acquire two production facilities from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing in April 2023.

HSY’s acquisition of Lily's (June 2021) is also a significant addition to its portfolio.Tyson Foods TSN is another food player benefiting from buyouts. TSN acquired Williams Sausage Company in May 2023 to solidify its product portfolio and manufacturing capacity. The addition of Keystone Foods (November 2018) goes in tandem with Tyson Foods’ domestic and international growth strategy.McCormick MKC has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions to grow its portfolio. In December 2020, McCormick bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. In November 2020, MKC also completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.

Stryzewski claims $2,100 is the ""new foundation,"" adding, ""it\'s just up from here.""

He explains that the Federal Reserve\'s outlook on rate cuts remains uncertain, and with bonds exhibiting ""a seesaw effect"" in response to interest rate movements, the value of bonds could take a hit.

Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal, to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. Now shifts in credit dynamics in the current US geopolitical landscape may call for a different approach to safeguarding your assets right now. So what's the best way to play your asset allocations?"", ""Let's bring in Sound Planning Group CEO David Stryzewski. David, let's start off with your buys here. And you like the metals. And specifically, what you like David, gold and silver."", ""Your first reason here, Dave. Let's walk through these points. When you look at the gold market, what you see is that it hit an all-time high. And importantly, you say it stayed above there."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah, that's right. So since 2020, there's been four different times that we have, you know, neared these all-time highs, but not broken above. Really big deal here on March 8, we broke above. And so, as we've broken above those levels, that means that there's more room to the upside."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Got it. Second point here, Dave. When you look at the gold market, what you're pointing out is-- you think what was a ceiling is now actually a new foundation."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: That's right. When we break above 2100, and then stay above, especially as a week lows, that has now become our new foundation, or floor. And so, I don't think that we're going to be going below 2100 from this point forward. It's just up from here."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Got it. And finally, talk about the role of central bankers.', ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: OK. So ultimately, the reason why the prices have been going up is not because advisors have been allocating instead of 60/40 portfolios into gold. There's not even 1% allocated there."", ""The reason why it's been going up is because of central bankers like China that have been buying thousands of tons of gold on an annualized basis. Now China doesn't do anything in secret. They're ultimately trying to let everyone know here that this is something that they think is very important. And they're buying thousands of tons of it."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Now-- so those are three reasons. Before everybody piles in, David, what would be-- our viewers are thinking about making a move into this metal. What would be the risks that you would point out?', ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Well, because the US dollar prices gold-- you know, our-- the dollar is ultimately-- if it gets stronger, that means that the value of gold goes down. But what we're seeing right now is inflation still continuing to rise. And so, the opposite is actually the case. Gold has gone up while the US dollar has actually lost some of its purchasing power."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. So let's turn to what you don't like here, David. So let's-- and let's talk bonds, specifically the AGG. Let's go through those reasons as well. Your chief point-- your first point here is frankly, our expectations of when the Fed's going to cut and by how much, they've been shifting."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah. If you just even look at the price movement this year alone, we started out the year with six Fed cuts priced in. Now we're looking at maybe a couple. I think that that might even go down to zero, if inflation continues to peak up."", ""And so, ultimately, if you own bonds, there's a seesaw effect. If interest rates rise, the value of bonds go down. This is a part of the reason why so much has been lost in bond portfolios, AGG specifically, over the last three years were actually negative. Still 316 this morning."", ""JOSH LIPTON: You're in good company, by the way. You've seen some noted economists, by the way, also telling their clients, we think there's increasing chances of no cuts. Your second point here. Let's just talk about yield."", ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah. So, you know, if the yield on the AGG is 3.3%, that's one of the reasons why you would own it is that you could get paid. Now the challenge is today that they have to compete with US treasuries that are not only safer, but even on the shorter duration."", ""So less of that swing risk there with the interest rate movement. You can actually get a better rate of return. And so, I think that a lot of the corporate bonds right now just don't even look nearly as attractive as the safest place yielding higher shorter duration."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Finally, the reason you would steer clear, or you just talk about frankly refinancing costs.', ""DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah, that's right. So ultimately, we're looking at a world right now where corporate debt is having to re-metabolize this debt at double the cost of what it was, you know, here in, you know, 2019, 2021, when every good CFO, you know, got as much debt as possible. And now, they're at this point after five-year terms that they're going to have to refinance this."", ""And so, everyone wants lower rates. Greater liquidity in the banks. The challenge today is that rates are twice as high. And there's not as much liquidity right now in banks. So I, for sure, see-- Chapter 11 is going to be coming strategic defaults."", ""And of course, the downside with that is that if bonds have defaults, you actually get zero back. You lose it all. So is that really the anchor that everyone wants to be focusing on right now, when we're at these all-time record highs in the US markets?"", ""JOSH LIPTON: And let me ask you-- it's going to be the same question, David. What is the kind of risk to your call, the upside risk here?"", 'DAVID STRYZEWSKI: Yeah. So the upside risks is that, you know, if rates trend down-- like-- you know, the Fed was forecasting 6%, or whatever, on the year. At least the duration on that AGG portfolio is about 8 and 1/2 years.', ""So you would actually would make money if rates dropped. It's just that the sentiment right now, and where we are today. With unemployment where it's at, CPI rising, all these things. It is not very likely that the Fed is going to be able to reduce rates in a meaningful way, unless something significantly breaks, which would actually be pointing to AGG. And then, I literally wouldn't want it anyway. So--"", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. Dave, let sum this one up for investors, because there's a lot to go over there. So you're telling investors, listen, buy gold and silver, as they are one of the few asset classes offering both exceptional value and promising growth prospects."", ""On the other side, though, you're saying avoid the US Aggregate Bond ETF that's amid a lower outlook on a Fed pivot. The option of yield from treasuries and the risks of holding corporate debt. Thank you so much for watching Good Buy or Goodbye. We're bringing you new episodes three times a week at 3:30 PM Eastern."", '[AUDIO LOGO]']"

If you would like to skip our discussion on the diverse weather patterns across the country, you can go to the 5 Cloudiest Cities in the U.S., Ranked.', 'Ranking fourth in terms of land area globally, the United States has a vast expanse of 3,800,000 square miles stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic. This extensive territory results in diverse weather patterns with significant regional differences in cloud cover. The eastern coast of the country experiences a temperate climate with a significant influence from the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the cloudiest cities in the US are found in the northeast, with Binghamton being one such city, averaging 212 cloudy days annually. Moving southward, places like Charleston, South Carolina, experience a milder climate with reduced cloud cover. The West Coast presents a contrast. The area’s unique geography and ocean currents contribute to a drier climate with less cloud cover. Seattle, Washington, often associated with rain, is among the largest cloudiest cities, averaging 226 days with over 80% cloud cover. Conversely, San Diego, California, enjoys enough sunshine, with 219 sunny days annually and fewer instances of cloud cover.', 'Moving to the Great Lakes region, one experiences a continental climate with distinct seasonal variations in cloud cover. Winters tend to be cloudier, with frequent lake-effect snow contributing to increased cloudiness. Places like Erie, Pennsylvania, showcase this trend with mostly cloudy or overcast skies up to 74% of the time during the winters. This falls to 28% of the time during summers. Mountain ranges across the US play a significant role in shaping cloud cover patterns. Areas on the windward side of mountains, like the Pacific Northwest, experience frequent cloud cover as moist air is forced upwards, leading to condensation and precipitation. In contrast, areas on the leeward side experience less cloud cover and drier conditions. Take, for example, Death Valley, California, located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountains. This scorching desert boasts an average of 291 days of sunshine per year, making it one of the sunniest places in the US.', 'Experts highlight the association between cloudy weather and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a condition linked to weather patterns. SAD, akin to depression in symptoms, commonly manifests during the fall and winter seasons. Hence, many of the cloudiest cities also rank among the gloomiest cities in the US. Psychiatry.org reports that 5% of adults in the US suffer from SAD, with a higher prevalence among women than men.\xa0Since the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a surge in the number of individuals in the United States reporting depressive symptoms. Between January and September 2020, over 530,000 people underwent depression screenings, marking a 62% rise compared to the prior year.', ""Considering these trends, the market for therapeutics addressing SAD is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.9% between 2024 and 2029, with North America hosting the largest customer base. Key companies producing\xa0medications targeting depression and other symptoms associated with SAD include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Axsome Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). In 2022, AbbVie Inc.'s (NYSE:ABBV) Vraylar achieved a significant milestone by securing a sought-after label expansion to treat depression. Similarly, Axsome Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM) launched Auvelity in the same year, offering a fast-acting oral treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) approval of Spravato nasal spray in 2020 marked an important moment as the first NMDA receptor antagonist for treating MDD. However, its approved usage was more limited compared to Auvelity, which has a broader label, permitting its use as a frontline treatment option. Despite differences in approved usage, these innovations collectively contribute to expanding treatment options for individuals suffering from depression and SAD, thus shaping the landscape of mental healthcare in the years ahead."", 'We have compiled a list of the 20 cloudiest cities in the U.S. based on the average number of cloudy days per year.

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 11 European Countries That Offer Citizenship by Descent. ', 'The increasing trend of international mobility has fueled a growing desire for acquiring a second citizenship. This desire has been further intensified by the uncertainty of life, evidenced by recent catastrophic events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial crisis of 2008, and ongoing geopolitical issues. With numerous advantages linked to citizenship in another country, the appeal of having a second home has inevitably surged. This has led to a scramble for second citizenship as individuals seek to secure their future and mitigate risks associated with global uncertainties.', 'There are several avenues through which citizenship can be obtained, including citizenship by birth, by descent, by marriage, by investment, and by naturalization. Each of these pathways has its own specific terms, conditions, and regulations that dictate the process of acquisition. Among these options, citizenship by descent is gaining popularity due to its simplicity and convenience. It is a process whereby familial ties to a country confer citizenship upon an individual. Essentially a form of birthright citizenship, eligibility for citizenship by descent is often based on the presence of ancestors such as parents, grandparents, and in some cases, even great-grandparents.', 'In contrast to other methods of acquiring citizenship, such as through investment or naturalization, which may require significant financial investments or lengthy periods of residency, citizenship by descent offers a more straightforward and cost-effective route. In recent years, there has been a notable trend towards European countries. In 2021, 827,000 people acquired EU member state citizenship, marking an increase of about 14% compared to 2020 (+98,300 people). This trend was particularly prominent in countries such as France (+43,900 French citizenships granted as opposed to 2020), Germany (+18,800), Spain (+17,700), Sweden (+9,200), and Austria (+7,200).', 'A report by GLOBALCIT in 2020 observed that a majority of EU member state citizens acquire their citizenship through birth, primarily through descent (ius sanguinis). However, the procedures for citizenship vary for individuals born to citizens within the country compared to those born to a citizen abroad. Between 2013 and 2020, certain changes regarding ius sanguinis were implemented in some EU member states, including the possibility of citizenship based on more remote ancestry. For example, in 2015, Portugal allowed the grant of citizenship through registration without the residence requirement to a person born abroad who is a grandchild of a citizen. However, this was conditional on the grandparent not having lost their Portuguese citizenship and being of Portuguese origin (born in Portugal), and the applicant having some effective ties with the country. Similarly, all countries have their own specific rules and conditions that determine the eligibility for citizenship by descent.', 'For approximately 9 million Americans living abroad in 2020, citizenship by ancestry can prove highly beneficial. Instead of navigating strenuous and costly measures for European citizenship, many Americans may actually be eligible for citizenship by descent in various European countries. For example, according to Forbes, more than 30 million US citizens are of Irish descent. Similarly, Americans can attain citizenship in other European countries such as Hungary and Poland. With a large number of multinational companies establishing themselves in Europe, relocation through citizenship by descent can become even more lucrative for US citizens. These companies include pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), as well as tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).', 'AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN), a British-Swedish merger is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, working on research, development, and manufacturing of prescription drugs.

This will take the annual payment to 2.7% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Mosaic was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", ""Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 10.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 22%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future."", ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.00 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.84. This works out to be a decline of approximately 1.7% per year over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges."", 'Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Mosaic has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 24% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.', 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for Mosaic you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Now that includes a new CEO.', 'Boeing, no. 58 on the Fortune 500, announced on Monday that president and CEO Dave Calhoun—a 26-year GE veteran who took over in January 2020—would be stepping down at the end of 2024. Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO, will retire, and Stephanie Pope has been appointed to lead BCA, effective Monday. (Last month, Boeing announced that Ed Clark, head of its 737 program, would be leaving the company, and Katie Ringgold, a long-time engineering and operations leader, was appointed to the role.)', ""Larry Kellner, a board chair, won't be running for reelection. Steve Mollenkopf, the former CEO of Qualcomm, has been named to succeed Kellner and will lead the board's search for the next CEO."", ""Brian West, EVP and CFO at Boeing, wasn’t mentioned in Monday's announcement. A company spokesperson later confirmed to me via email he'll remain on as CFO."", ""West joined the company in August 2021 after serving as CFO at Refinitiv. He also held CFO and operations roles at Oscar Health and Nielsen, and before that spent 16 years at GE. At the Bank of America Global Industrials Conference on March 20, he said of Boeing's recent troubles: “It’s a hard moment, and we’re probably better because of it. But I’m confident we’re going to see our way through it.”"", ""West also said the company would see free cash flow usage of up to $4.5 billion during the current quarter as it works to strengthen and support production lines. Scrutiny of its manufacturing process isn't new. “The 108-year-old corporate icon had been dogged by safety concerns since two fatal crashes darkened its reputation and sent its finances reeling a half-decade ago—the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters that together killed 346 people,” Fortune’s Shawn Tully wrote last month."", ""So how will Boeing's board respond? “The best leaders are forged in fire,” Ron Epstein, an analyst with Bank of America, said in a note to investors. “This may be the first real chance, in a long time, Boeing has had to clean house and reset their own narrative.”"", 'To find out what boards, in a general sense, look for when conducting CEO searches, I had a chat with Jenna Fisher, managing director and co-head of the CFO practice at Russell Reynolds Associates (RRA), an executive search firm.', '“We usually think the best predictor of the future is past performance,” Fisher said. “And that means somebody who has been through other\xa0analogous\xa0challenging situations.”', ""But following the pandemic, Fisher added, more companies are turning to first-time C-suite talent—CEOs, CFO, officers, you name it. Candidates still need to leverage their expertise, but there's a greater emphasis on learning agility and leading across teams."", '“How can someone who perhaps has never had any exposure to a particular challenge or area come up to speed relatively quickly?” Fisher said.\xa0“This requires systems thinkers, something we have seen our clients request with much greater regularity post-pandemic.”', 'RRA data shows that more CFOs are being considered for the top spot. In 2023, 24% of S&P 500 CFOs who changed jobs moved to CEO or president roles, which is slightly down from 33% in 2022 but still much higher than 8.8% in 2021.', 'However, Fisher noted: ""In almost every case in the S&P 500 that we\'ve seen, there tends to be an interim step where the CFO expands his or her duties to become COO, or president, before taking on the CEO role.""', ""While it's unclear how shifting leadership may affect West's role, what's absolutely clear is that Boeing's board faces a very tall task."", 'Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com', 'María Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today’s newsletter.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

However, before investing in Boeing's stock, it's vital to consider the current situation and its potential impact on the company's long-term growth. Therefore, it's crucial to understand the key takeaways from West's presentation and its significance for investors."", ""On Jan. 5, a panel on a Boeing plane blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight, which resulted in serious consequences. Apart from the FAA conducting audits into Boeing and fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems' (NYSE: SPR) production, the incident has led Boeing's management to reconsider its approach to operations. West's presentation highlighted four key points to consider."", 'First, West highlighted the need for a ""step change improvement in how we think about traveled work."" This refers to work that is delayed and/or finished in another location.', 'For example, West noted that Boeing eliminated ""travel work"" between Wichita and Renton from the start of March and ""will only accept a fully conforming fuselage from Spirit AeroSystems."" The latter, which used to be part of Boeing, supplies fuselages on the 737 MAX.', 'Second, he outlined that Boeing had consciously decided to slow down production on the 737 MAX to make changes and ensure quality control.', 'Third, he stated that Boeing would aim to better synchronize its suppliers, with some needing to catch up with the production schedule and others needing to slow down.', 'Fourth, he acknowledged that Boeing had gotten ahead of itself in outsourcing and that a potential deal to bring Spirit AeroSystems back in-house would be funded with a mix of cash and debt.', 'Investors should note a couple of things:', ""All of the points discussed above tend to weaken and push out Boeing's cash-flow generation and add to its debt."", 'Less robust cash-flow generation makes it harder for Boeing to eventually invest in developing a new airplane for the next generation of planes.', ""According to Boeing's Investor Day presentation in November 2022, Boeing aims to generate $10 billion in free cash flow (FCF) between 2025 and 2026. To achieve this target, Boeing plans to increase the production rate of the 737 to 50 per month and improve the profit margins of the Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) sector from negative 7.1% in 2023 to high single-digits."", 'With West guiding toward low-single-digit billions in FCF in 2024 and the production rate on the 737 currently below 38 a month, Boeing is clearly struggling to meet the $10 billion in FCF target in 2025. West acknowledged that hitting the figure would take longer than planned but would be within the 2025-2026 window.', ""That's fair enough. However, the operational changes discussed above will pressure cash flow and debt. Buying Spirit will increase debt, and given its recent history of cash outflows, it could lead to FCF challenges at Boeing."", 'Furthermore, discontinuing ""traveled work"" and reducing the pace of 737 production also impacts cash flow. And improving the coordination among suppliers means that Boeing may face some working capital constraints as it builds inventory from some suppliers while waiting for others to catch up. This all points to a worsening cash flow and debt profile.', 'Cash matters a huge amount because it takes many years and a lot of money to develop a new plane. In fact, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has said it won\'t have a new plane in place before 2035. Indeed, West repeated the mantra that Boeing was looking for a 20% to 30% improvement in airplane efficiency coming from ""engine technology and aerodynamic investment"" before Boeing intends to have a new airplane in place.', ""Unfortunately, Boeing is not guaranteed to be at the forefront of this development. Purely by way of example, China's Comac C919 airplane uses LEAP engines made by a GE joint venture, CFM International, and Brazil's Embraer E2-195 airplane uses geared turbofan engines from RTX's Pratt & Whitney."", 'They can both win market share in the growth markets of international aviation while taking advantage of new engine technology.', 'The upside potential for Boeing stock is obvious: $10 billion in FCF represents 8.7% of its current market cap and has a multiyear backlog. But the downside risk is growing. Any downturn in the aviation market could leave the company with a worsening debt profile and challenge its ability to invest in new planes over the next decade. As such, buying into its suppliers rather than Boeing stock right now makes more sense.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

STRL, Fluor Corporation FLR, and Quanta Services, Inc. PWR, is capitalizing on robust global shifts toward infrastructure modernization, energy transition, and heightened national security concerns. Particularly, United Rentals is poised to sustain its upward trajectory in the foreseeable future, given its solutions closely align with both U.S. governmental policies and prevailing industry dynamics.The pressing need to revamp the nation's deteriorating infrastructure, coupled with funding for new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives, bodes well for United Rentals. The company anticipates a varied portfolio of federal projects spanning road and bridge renovations, water management, harbor and port enhancements, and upgrades to the power grid, all of which are anticipated to fuel growth throughout 2024.Robust Rental Revenue Growth: Backed by the company’s multi-year tailwinds in infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power, along with strong customer demand, United Rentals has been witnessing widespread growth in rental revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2023, rental revenues grew 13.5% to $3.12 billion, year over year. The company witnessed robust demand across geographies, verticals, and customer segments.Industrial manufacturing and power drove substantial growth in industrial end markets. In construction markets, both infrastructure and non-residential sectors exhibited solid year-over-year growth as customers initiated diverse projects, including battery plants, semiconductor-related jobs, power, infrastructure, and data centers.Diverse Rental Fleet: United Rentals’ extensive and diverse fleet allows it to serve large customers that require a wide range of equipment. United Rentals now offers a wide range of products to a diverse group of customers and geographies that dampen the cyclicality of the construction market. The specialty business segment achieved another outstanding quarter, showcasing 14.6% year-over-year growth in fourth-quarter 2023 rental revenues. Within the specialty sector, URI successfully launched 10 new locations during the quarter, thereby contributing to a total of 49 new specialty locations opened throughout the year."", ""Business Cyclicality: The equipment business of United Rentals is subject to the cyclical fluctuations of the markets. Both the general rental equipment and Specialty equipment divisions cater to private non-residential construction and industrial activities, which exhibit high cyclicality. Any downturn in these markets directly influences the demand for United Rentals' equipment and rental rates, consequently impacting revenues and operating margins, especially due to fixed costs. A deterioration in economic conditions, particularly within North American construction and industrial sectors, can further exacerbate weaknesses in these end markets.Volatility in the Energy Sector: The demand for United Rentals' services and products is intricately tied to the level of exploration, development, and production activity within oil and natural gas companies. This activity is significantly influenced by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which have a history of volatility and are expected to remain so in the foreseeable future."", ""Sterling Infrastructure: The company, a leader in heavy civil infrastructure construction and residential construction projects, showcased remarkable financial progress in 2023, witnessing substantial boosts in revenues, net income, and earnings per share.

The primary opportunities driving this demand include those in the chemicals sector, closely followed by energy transition, fuel production, as well as mining and metals and big data. In 2023, Fluor successfully secured consolidated new awards amounting to $19.52 billion, with a book-to-burn ratio of 1.3x, which aligned with its full-year plan to achieve a book-to-burn ratio exceeding 1.Quanta Services: The demand for Quanta's infrastructure solutions, essential for facilitating energy transition efforts and improving reliability, safety, and efficiency, continued to surge.

This improving trend is reflected in the company’s backlog levels. The company, which shares space with Fluor Corporation FLR, KBR, Inc. KBR and Quanta Services, Inc.

Federal contracts based on a low price, which is technically an acceptable criterion that emphasizes price over qualitative factors, are increasing. This implies that the company may face significant pricing pressure, which will ultimately reduce profit margins from future federal contracts.Risks of International Market Dependence: AECOM’s business is subject to international political and economic conditions, given the concentration of business markets outside of the United States. Factors like changes in the United States’ and other national governments’ trade policies, regulatory practices, tariffs and taxes, further devaluations and other conversion restrictions and logistical & communication challenges might adversely impact the company’s financials.

Finland and Sweden are the latest countries to join NATO following the start of the war, while several other countries across the region are actively racking up their military expenditure to bolster national defense.', 'Global defense spending reached a record high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in 30 years, having spent $480 billion in military expenditure during the year. NATO’s defense spending in 2022 was also 0.9% higher than in 2021, totaling $1.2 trillion. Final, aggregated figures for 2023 are still awaited, however, another recent report by SIPRI noted a 94% increase in arms imported by European countries between 2019-2023, compared to the previous five-year period from 2014-18. The United States was the origin of 55% of the arms procured by Europe in the last five years.', 'The surge in military expenditure amid growing calls from the United States and NATO for members of the treaty to meet the expectation of spending at least 2% of their GDP on defense has created a boom in the armaments and aerospace industries. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s full-year financial statements for 2023 reported a 2.4% increase in revenue compared to the previous year to total $67.6 billion.

Last year, Canada announced it was buying 88 of these fifth-generation fighter jets to enhance Arctic security and also get closer to NATO’s spending expectations.

With about 70% of its $66 billion in revenue from the U.S. government, the company is well positioned to benefit from U.S. defense budget growth, historically 5%-6% per year, as well as increased global military spending. With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns. We re-initiated a small position in August.', 'RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s figures are also soaring. The company generated revenues of $68.9 billion in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 3%, with contracts continuing to flow to the company from NATO countries seeking to enhance national security.

However, the country has consistently remained under target as far as NATO’s 2% spending goal is considered. Last year, it only spent 1.57% of the GDP on defense. In February, the government pledged to meet NATO’s goal by next decade, and stated that its defense spending could rise up to 3.5% of the GDP by then.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $737', ""France boasts one of Europe's strongest and largest militaries, and spent 1.9% of its GDP on defense expenditure in 2023. Last January, French president Emmanuel Macron announced to raise the country’s military budget by 40% for 2024-2030 to enable the French military to be combat ready, amid the volatile situation in Ukraine.

Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide engineering, technical, design agent and planning yard support for operational strategic and attack submarines.', 'The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in Groton, CT.', 'Changes in military dynamics have led to increasing defense spending as a well-funded military can deter sudden assault by other nations.

Looking ahead, per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2024-2029.In this context, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics’ Electric Boat unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. This unit has been building submarines since 1899 and is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of both Virginia-class attack submarines and Columbia class ballistic-missile submarines.Impressively, General Dynamics has been investing significant capital over the past several years in expanding and modernizing facilities at Electric Boat to support the growth in submarine construction. Currently, the company is working on Blocks IV and V in the Virginia-class submarine program, with 16 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. Besides, construction of the Columbia class submarines is scheduled to continue for two decades and the value of the Navy’s program of record is in excess of $115 billion.The aforementioned statistic is indicative of the solid demand that GD’s Electric Boat unit enjoys in the submarine market, which, in turn, has been enabling the company to win significant contracts like the latest one that should boost its revenue generation prospects.

One such company, which had been experiencing strong momentum, just issued an update that disappointed shareholders.', ""I'm talking about Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU). While it beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates, investors weren't pleased with some other data points. The top apparel stock was down 16% the day after the announcement, and it has dropped around 20% year to date (as of this writing). That seriously lags the 9% gain of the Nasdaq Composite. "", ""For the three-month period that ended Jan. 28, which was Lululemon's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, the business reported revenue of $3.2 billion (up 16% year over year) and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.29 (up 20% when adjusting for the impairment charge a year ago). If this was all the information Lululemon provided, you'd assume that the company was firing on all cylinders. These headline figures exceeded Wall Street expectations."", 'However, investors were disappointed with some notable trends. For starters, sales in the Americas region increased by 9% in Q4. That was compared to 29% growth in the year-ago period, when it was called the North America segment.', '""As you\'ve heard from others in our industry, there has been a shift in the US consumer behavior of late, and we\'re navigating what has been a slower start to the year in this market,"" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call.', ""Adding more negativity to the mix, the forecast executives provided also fell short of consensus analyst estimates. Projected net sales of $2.2 billion and diluted EPS of $2.40 (both the high end of guidance) in the current quarter weren't well received by the market."", ""It's easy to get caught up with the latest financial results. But for long-term investors, there's rarely anything that happens in a three-month period that alters the intrinsic value of a business. With that in mind, I believe Lululemon is still a high-quality enterprise. Same-store sales increased 12%, an encouraging sign."", ""Management is still focused on growth objectives, opening 25 net new stores in Q4.

For all of fiscal 2023, the gross margin and operating margin came in at 58.3% and 22.2%, respectively. These metrics demonstrate just how profitable the company is.

But the business still put up solid Q4 numbers. As long as the company remains focused on its premium brand status and innovative product offerings, I believe it should do fine."", ""Even before the stock took a hit, it wasn't that expensive. But now, shares are much more attractively priced, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.3. This is a slight premium to Nike."", ""However, it's very easy to argue that Lululemon's return going forward will crush its bigger foe. Lululemon has far greater growth potential, particularly internationally, while Nike is already an established player. Lululemon is also just scratching the surface of the men's category, which has provided a nice boost to sales up to this point."", ""I also previously touched on Lululemon's better margins.

Discount retailers like The TJX Companies (TJX) and Burlington Stores (BURL), however, have held up as consumers seek sales elsewhere under the pressure of inflation."", 'JLL Americas President of Retail Naveen Jaggi joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of retail and the consumer, as well as the success of brands like Burlington.', 'He discusses Burlington\'s recent growth and how it relates to the consumer: ""Today, they\'re opening over 60 stores a year and they\'re taking 50, 60, 70,000 square feet in some places. To me, I\'m watching that entire sector and saying where the US consumer is shopping, that\'s the sector I want to watch because that tells me where we spend our dollars has the most sustainability in the long run and today more than ever, the dollar value sector is grabbing a more lion\'s share of the US consumer than ever before.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Some of America's best known retailers are struggling to stay relevant in the last month. Macy's announced it's closing 150 stores despite this retail openings outweighed closures last year, and consumer spending has held up. Naveen Jaggi is JLL America's president of retail, joins us here on set. It's good to talk to you today."", ""We were talking about this morning, about when you think about where retail is headed, a lot of department stores may be looking for a smaller footprint, more localized footprint. Talk to me about what it is that you're seeing in this environment."", ""NAVEEN JAGGI: Well, I think what we're seeing is a big shift in the way consumers spend, right. So the days of the big department store anchored malls have a place in America, but we don't need to see as many of those big department stores because consumers have found a way to find what they want at a much closer location to their home."", ""And it's not surprising if you think about the way Macy's is saying that their future growth is in the 30,000 square foot space. That's what they claim, that they're going to have a big effort in that level, which says to them, look, we know that there's Burlington, TJX, and those kinds of brands that are capturing a lion's share of the US consumer dollar, more than ever before. That's where they can use their scale and their buying power to meet that demand."", ""So, it makes good sense for them to pivot. And as we also saw from Nordstrom's. What have they said recently? Nordstrom's rack is the biggest brand for them to drive their growth. They've taken their focus off the Department store. So the Department stores have a place, but I think the reality is more of these value oriented retail spaces in the 30,000 square foot space makes the most sense because that's where consumers want to go."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Are there any, when you look across kind of the retail landscape, are there certain names that you pay more attention to than others, certain bellwethers that you consider for the sector?', ""NAVEEN JAGGI: Yeah, so, if we're talking about that one particular-- call it daily goods value sector, right, so if you want to talk about brands such as TJX and now Burlington. I mean, it's fascinating to watch a group like Burlington. Five years ago, Burlington was the Burlington Coat Factory. It was not really known as a value player against TJX or Ross. Today, they're having over 60 stores a year, and they're taking 50, 60, 70,000ft in some cases."", ""So to me, I'm watching that entire sector and saying, where are the US consumer shopping? That's the sector I want to watch because that tells me where we spend our dollars has the most sustainability in the long run. And today more than ever, the dollar value sector is grabbing a more lion's share of the US consumer than ever before. I'm watching that sector, whether it's grocery or soft goods."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Is there something to be said also about the payoff that the buy in that you get at some of these discount stores in a physical store?', 'NAVEEN JAGGI: Absolutely.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: If you think about a Nordstrom or Macy's, you don't necessarily have to go into the store. I mean, I say that as somebody who shops online a lot, but when you go into a TJX store, you ultimately are going there to sort through things to be able to find the best value. I mean, that, is that a big part of--"", 'NAVEEN JAGGI: The thrill of the find-- we know that TJX, for example, will go out and find a lot of these very high demand department store type of product, but you can get a much smaller location. So the thrill of the seek, the search, the find, that makes it the adventure. None of those brands have a very large presence online. They have somewhat of a presence, but they actually want you to come inside.', ""So, as opposed to buying a crock pot or buying a dress online through Macy's and picking it up, which is certainly right for a big part of the American public, the adventure and finding it at a value, that's what seems to work for a lot of Americans today more than ever. And that's why I think Aldi and other brands have done the same thing. Come to the store, find a bargain you won't find anywhere else for a limited time. Get it now before it's gone."", ""JOSH LIPTON: I want to get, Naveen, also your broad take on the US consumer right now. I think they've actually surprised a lot of people with just how resilient they are, but what are you seeing now, Naveen, and what do you see looking ahead?"", 'NAVEEN JAGGI: Well, I think the US consumer has shocked everybody. Back in the holiday season, right, they were projected to do about 4.4 per year sales over 23, over 22-- 5.6% over year over year. That tells you this consumer is a lot stronger than everybody says. So to me, the US consumer will remain strong as long as we have low labor. So, right now unemployment level is what, 3.7, 3.8, right?', 'Wages are up, or at least better than they were five, six, seven years ago. So to me, as long as the US consumer feels strong, market is up, so therefore it wants to feel better than it did a year ago. All of this gives them confidence to go shopping. So, as long as the US consumer continues to shop, and they have shown no indication to pull back on shopping, we will see a healthy retail environment.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Part of that is also execution though, right. And when you think about it, I mean, the consumer is not all the same. And when you think about where the retailers have been, those that have been able to stay ahead are those that have really executed on very specific needs that the consumer has had.', ""NAVEEN JAGGI: So retailers-- the ones who've really got it figured out, which is to give the consumer what they want and execute it really well. So, we were talking about this a while ago with Lululemon. What a great brand. I mean, they've been on a run for the past three or four years. They're a hot streak, right. They execute what they have and what they make very, very well. They know exactly what the Lulu consumer wants."", ""And so what do we see now? We see Alo Yoga, Beyond Yoga. We see other brands coming in and trying to nip at their heels, but the ones who nail it really well, Dollar General and the Dollar Sector, they do it really, really well. There's many of these what I call brand killers. They execute so well. The US consumer is so loyal to them. They know whatever they do, the consumer follows."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Loyalty certainly significant.', 'NAVEEN JAGGI: Absolutely.', 'AKIKO FUJITA: Naveen Jaggi, good to talk to you today.

The Air Force 1’s are known for their all-white design, while the Pegasus have large Nike swooshes on their mid-sole.

Lulu's aforementioned outperformance has not been without its share of detractors, with this negative surprise strengthening the naysayers' conviction. The bearish argument is for shifting consumer preferences in the company's core North American market, which still accounts for almost 80% of its total revenues. The bears acknowledge the company's favorable international momentum but see a slowdown in the core home market as a far more significant headwind going forward."", ""In a way, the Nike and Lululemon reports don't tell us much about the health of the consumer economy, which has long been seen as vulnerable due to cyclical and macroeconomic factors but continues to chug along."", ""That said, discretionary spending appears to be going more towards 'experiential' categories, like leisure and entertainment, instead of the type of 'goods' that Nike and Lululemon offer.

FBK recently announced a share repurchase program. Per the plan, the company is authorized to buy back up to $100 million worth of shares. The plan is set to expire on Jan 31, 2026.This new repurchase plan replaced the company’s prior authorization, which expired on Jan 31, 2024. During 2023, the company bought back 136,262 shares of its common stock. As of Dec 31, 2023, approximately $61 million worth of shares were remaining under the old repurchase plan.As stated by Christopher T. Holmes, president and chief executive officer, “This repurchase authorization reflects the Company’s financial strength and strong profitability. Our management team is keenly focused on deploying capital to deliver superior returns and to create long-term value. This program provides another arrow in our quiver to achieve those objectives.”Prior to this, FBK announced a repurchase program in 2022, preceded by a plan announced in 2021, worth $100 million each.Apart from the repurchase programs, the company also pays out regular quarterly dividends. In January, FB Financial increased its dividend 13% to 17 cents from its prior payout. The dividend was paid out on Feb 27, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Feb 13, 2024.Based on yesterday’s closing price of $37.25, the annualized dividend yield is currently pegged at 1.83%.

The company is benefiting from strength across 3D DRAM and advanced packaging technologies. Growing etch and deposition intensity owing to increasing technology inflections in 3D architectures, is a positive.However, weakness in the systems business, primarily due to sluggish memory spending, is a major concern. Although sluggish wafer fabrication equipment spending remains a concern, improvement in the outlook for the same owing to modest memory recovery, is a positive.For 2024, WFE spending is expected to be in the mid-high $80 billion range.

That said, the company should benefit from robust growth in total payments volume. Further, strengthening customer engagement on the company’s platform is a major positive.Furthermore, Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth. Additionally, solid momentum of core peer to peer and PayPal Checkout experiences is a tailwind. Also, well-performing merchant services are positives.

Even major US financial institutions faced challenges throughout 2023. In 2024, a\xa0global economic slowdown and macroeconomic weakness fuelled by high interest rates are expected to stir up problems for the banking industry. Although governments worldwide are implementing measures to control inflation, many factors still pose a risk to economic prosperity, including supply chain disruptions, changing trade relationships, geopolitical tensions, and extreme weather events. IMF's latest forecasts indicate global economic growth of only 3% in 2024, with developed economies showing modest growth rates and emerging economies experiencing notable growth.\xa0"", ""According to a Deloitte report, banks globally will face challenges that impact their revenue generation and cost management in 2024. High interest rates have increased net interest income, especially in the United States and Canada, while also driving up funding costs and reducing margins consequently. The global banking industry is now faced with an uphill battle to control deposit costs while customer expectations and market competition skyrocket. Loan growth is forecasted to be modest, given the high borrowing costs and overall macroeconomic dynamics, with banks likely to maintain restrictive credit lending policies. While consumer spending is strong, demand for credit card and auto loans is predicted to remain robust, while demand for corporate loans may temporarily weaken before likely recovering later this year. Additionally, climate change considerations are largely impacting credit availability and loan demand. The blend of higher deposit costs, lower policy rates, and limited loan potential may affect banks' ability to maintain strong net interest margins in 2024. Looking ahead, the global banking landscape is expected to experience further transformation, with Chinese and American banks dominating global rankings and rising influence from Indian banks and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds anticipated over the coming decade."", 'In 2024, Fidelity believes there may be a reason for cautious optimism despite the unsettling closures in 2023, which were driven by specific circumstances not necessarily applicable to all banks and financial institutions. Macroeconomic factors such as growth, inflation, and Federal Reserve policy will likely remain pivotal for the financial sector and the broader market. Recent events at Silicon Valley Bank underscored the importance of deposit quality in the current environment. With interest rates rising, depositors now have higher-yielding options for their excess cash, making deposits more susceptible to potential flight. Hence, focusing on high-quality deposits has become imperative. Institutions like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and M&T Bank illustrate the advantages of such stability.\xa0', 'In 2024, many financial services dealmakers are feeling more optimistic compared to last year, as recent improvements in financial markets and positive signals about interest rates from central banks are slowly restoring investor confidence. Present market conditions, paired with ongoing initiatives like digitalization, sustainability, and addressing workforce challenges, are pushing financial services players to quicken their transformation efforts to remain competitive and profitable. M&A remains a significant part of this transformation journey, especially as organic growth faces challenges in the current macroeconomic environment. Dealmakers are likely to prefer smaller transactions over mega-deals to facilitate transformational steps. Deal processes may also become more complex and protracted. According to PwC, some sectors within the financial services industry are especially attractive for M&A activity in 2024. These include asset and wealth management, insurance, private equity, payments, and fintech. Asset and wealth managers are expected to boost M&A to achieve scale and acquire new capabilities, while insurance companies may divest complex legacy portfolios to reduce costs and enhance capital efficiency. Private equity investors are largely focusing on financial services-related sectors, such as insurance brokerage and fintech, for M&A opportunities.

PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants.

Today, it remains the strongest competitor in a fast-moving industry, and it is by far the cheapest, highest-quality tech stock you can buy in 2024.', ""The core of PayPal's business comes from the merchants who accept it as a form of payment and the customers who rely on it to pay their bills."", 'For merchants, the main value of accepting PayPal is it gives a customer the flexibility to pay with their credit/debit card, Venmo, or even competing digital wallets. This reduces friction and makes it easier (and therefore more likely) for a transaction to occur.', 'For customers, the biggest benefit is privacy and security. PayPal customers can buy something without sharing their financial information with the merchant.', ""PayPal's simplicity and security has created widespread brand awareness among people of all ages."", ""Today, PayPal has 391 million consumer accounts and 35 million merchant accounts, but its most important metric is total payment volume (TPV), which rose 13% in 2023 to $1.53 trillion. It is the single biggest driver of the company's revenue. "", ""Overall, PayPal's net revenue increased 8% in 2022 and 2023, and there's good reason to think it will grow by a consistent 8%-plus annually for years to come."", ""Although this company is no longer the rapidly expanding Silicon Valley start-up it once was, it's still providing solid revenue and payment volume growth 25 years later, and there are three main reasons this should continue."", ""First, PayPal's massive size gives it a moat in the competitive digital payments industry. It was the first mover and operates in 200 countries and territories around the world. For a competitor to take away market share, it has to have a much better value proposition for someone to stop using their PayPal account."", 'The more customers who use PayPal, the more merchants will accept it as payment.\xa0This will keep total payment volume growing for years to come.', ""Second, PayPal isn't just a high-value, well-known global brand. The company also owns brands including Venmo, Braintree, HyperWallet, and Xoom."", ""Venmo is one of the most popular digital payment apps. Over 78 million people use it, mostly in the United States, and Venmo's revenue doubled from 2020 to 2022. Braintree helps merchants accept both PayPal and credit cards with a single integration. HyperWallet makes global payments quick and simple, and Xoom lets people transfer money."", ""Whenever someone makes a purchase using any of PayPal's brands, the company receives a portion of the amount. It's a lucrative business to be in, especially when TPV is rising consistently like PayPal's is."", ""Finally, PayPal's moat extends beyond its size and well-known brands. Because the industry is so regulated, that makes it extremely difficult for new competitors to enter. PayPal's government licenses allow it to operate, and a competitor can't simply join the industry without government approval."", 'The company owns licenses in the U.S. to operate as a money transmitter, and in the state of New York it holds a full BitLicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services. These licenses extend to its other brands.', ""PayPal has a consistently growing business, as well as a clear path to staying ahead of the competition, but we haven't reached my biggest reason to be bullish..."", 'PayPal is a tech stock in the digital payments space, but its valuation is closer to a bargain value stock.', ""As I'm writing, its price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is just 2.16, which means investors are paying $2.16 for every dollar of the company's sales."", 'In June 2021, the P/S was nearly 15! This stock is cheap compared to its historical average, and cheap compared to its competitors, too.', 'Global Payments is a digital payments company and member of the S&P 500 and Fortune 500. Its P/S is 3.52 today, roughly 63% more expensive than PayPal.', 'Block, which owns CashApp and Square, has a P/S of 2.29 -- just a little more than PayPal.', ""PayPal's ubiquity has made it one of the world's most well-known brands among nearly every demographic, and its size and scale are fueling its next evolution of growth."", 'The new era of cryptocurrencies has made digital payment software even more important, and PayPal is in a perfect position to capitalize.', ""The stock's 2.16 P/S makes it the cheapest, highest-quality tech company in the market today. PayPal probably won't trade at a discount for long, because its Venmo subsidiary and its government licenses ensure years of steady growth."", 'This is the type of stock you can buy and hold for years.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But will ChatGPT blossom, with ramifications for any worker’s job, or will it wither as the petals fall off the proverbial plant?', 'Even if people are mixed on whether AI will take your job or enhance it, one thing is becoming clear: Managers are starting to pit these innovations against disenfranchised workers.', 'Look no further than IBM, whose shares have soared by nearly 17% since the beginning of the year—a boon attributed in part to the company’s adoption of AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been open about the fact that many jobs at IBM can be partially or completely replaced by AI, even writing in an April commentary piece for Fortune that he had used AI to reduce the number of employees working on relatively manual HR-related work to about 50 from 700 previously, which allowed the company to focus on other things.', 'But Krishna is a bit mixed on the topic, having flip-flopped from saying certain roles would be replaced by AI to declaring that AI will generate more jobs than it eliminates. That’s all to say, the jury is out on how the decision-makers will eventually greet and implement AI.', 'However, bosses are considering following IBM’s lead, a massive survey suggests: A whopping 41% of managers say they’re hoping to replace workers with cheaper AI products this year, according to a survey of 3,000 managers by software company beautiful.ai.', 'The report comes amid a groundswell of worker rage and instability. Employees haven’t felt this poorly about their jobs since this pandemic first hit, according to a survey from BambooHR. Struggling to make ends meet, many Americans have turned sour on the workforce and reported a loss in faith in almost every profession in the most recent Gallup Honesty and Ethics poll.', 'Wage growth has recently outpaced inflation, though after years of volatility it makes sense that many households aren’t feeling that data necessarily hit their wallets. While union popularity recently surged (amid UAW success stories and research regarding the financial impact of a union), membership is still at a record low after decades of decline. The struggle for greater pay and a livable wage is evident in the ""hot labor summer,"" as strike activity increased by 280% in just this past year.', ""But it seems as if some managers' heads are being turned when the question becomes whether to give out a raise or hire a robot. In the new survey, almost half of managers (48%) reported that their companies would profit from replacing swaths of human workers with tools.\xa0And 45% said they saw these innovations as a chance to “lower salaries of employees because less human-powered work is needed.”"", 'Of course there was a wave of paranoia when AI first began to go through its growth spurt in 2023. Rapid improvement and evolution caused many to shift in their seats as 61% of Americans believed new products could threaten civilization, per a Reuters/Ipsos survey.', 'As knee-jerk reactions to AI faded over the course of the year, new theories cropped up about AI’s trajectory. “No, it won’t replace you, but a human who could use AI better than you might,” became a popular take. Some suggested your danger of losing a job depending on your sector, level of seniority, or location of work. And junior workers, by nature of vulnerability, reported the greatest fear of losing their jobs to AI. Many employees look to learn more about the beast they fear (it’s the devil—or generative AI—you know), as 79% reported they wanted training in the area to consulting firm Oliver Wyman.', 'Consider Noah Smith, the influential economic writer who left his perch at Bloomberg Opinion to launch his own Substack, and Niall Ferguson, the Scottish economic historian who has held perches at Stanford and Harvard (as well as Bloomberg Opinion). They recently weighed in with their versions of the doomer vs. accelerationist debate.', '“It’s very possible that regular humans will have plentiful, high-paying jobs in the age of A.I. dominance—often doing much the same kind of work that they’re doing right now,” Smith wrote on his Substack, prompting agreement and debate from a range of leading economists who talked to the New York Times’ Peter Coy. Ferguson had cold water to throw on this, saying, “…recent evidence about labor market shocks from automation and international trade suggests that the negative impacts of AI will be geographically and demographically concentrated, and labor markets in the hardest-hit places will not adapt smoothly.”', 'Even so, after investors have poured billions into AI, triggering comparisons to the stock market of the mid- or late-90s, Rana Foroohar of the Financial Times cautions we might be getting ahead of ourselves. Cautioning against the “inevitability” of AI changing the world, upending our jobs, or boosting productivity, she warns we are still at the early stage of innovation, and this will take decades to play out—and, of course, that the bubble could soon burst.', ""We’re in new territory, or shaky ground, if you take the experts' mixed predictions for it. It all means managers likely don’t have the AI leverage they think they do to quash a potential worker uprising (if that’s what they wanted). And even if they did, managers might be better off worrying for their own roles. Those at the top might be more exposed to AI invasion, though by nature of making executive decisions are likely shielded from true vulnerability. And 48% of managers posited that AI tools were a threat to their salaries and will lead to wage declines throughout the workforce this year. Even more (50%) reported fear their management position would experience a dock in pay related to AI."", 'But most managers aren’t actually looking to have a fully robotic workforce. Rather, 66% of managers are looking to use AI tools to enhance their employees’ productivity. Only 12% of bosses said they’re using AI with the purpose of downsizing or spending less on their workforce. So managers might be bluffing or simply weighing their options right now.', '“AI may not replace managers, but the managers that use AI will replace the managers that do not,” IBM’s chief commercial officer Rob Thomas said in a conference, according to TechCrunch. “It really does change how people work.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

MDLZ has been leveraging its core strengths in key categories amid rising costs. The company has strategically expanded its snacking category, especially focusing on chocolates and biscuits, which have driven its performance.MDLZ's focus on core categories, specifically chocolates and biscuits, has shown resilience and appeal, particularly as consumers prioritize snacking over traditional meals. Both these categories registered double-digit growth during the full year 2023, including an 11.9% surge in biscuits and a 14.5% increase in chocolates.In the fourth quarter, the biscuit and chocolate categories registered sales growth of 5.5% and 11.2%, respectively.

The company is on track to generate around 90% of its revenues through these categories in the long run."", ""MDLZ's growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions to broaden its portfolio and geographical footprint. Recent acquisitions have significantly contributed to revenue growth and strengthened the company's market presence in key regions.

These acquisitions have not only expanded Mondelez's product offerings but also strengthened its market presence in key regions.Mondelez is committed to increasing focus on areas with higher growth potential. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company announced the sale of its developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle.

Hershey HSY signed an agreement to acquire two production facilities from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing in April 2023. The addition of Dot’s Pretzels (December 2021) has also been a perfect match for Hershey’s growing salty snacking portfolio. HSY’s acquisition of Lily's (June 2021) is also a significant addition to its portfolio.Tyson Foods TSN is another food player benefiting from buyouts. TSN acquired Williams Sausage Company in May 2023 to solidify its product portfolio and manufacturing capacity. The addition of Keystone Foods (November 2018) goes in tandem with Tyson Foods’ domestic and international growth strategy.McCormick MKC has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions to grow its portfolio. In December 2020, McCormick bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. In November 2020, MKC also completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. The buyout of Cholula accelerates McCormick’s growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category."", 'Despite challenges such as cost inflation, Mondelez remains focused on operational efficiency and cost management.

""We welcome their engagement and are very open to hear from them about what they find and their perspective on things we may need to change to make us even safer.""', 'The FAA told Fortune in a statement that the oversight will “ensure that [United] is complying with safety regulations; identifying hazards and mitigating risk; and effectively managing safety.” It may prevent the airline from making new routes ahead of the busy summer season and may also delay future projects, depending on the oversight’s findings. The FAA also suspended United from promoting and approving pilots to fly different plane models, Bloomberg reported.', 'The crackdown underlies the seriousness with which the regulator is responding to safety meltdowns in the airline industry, which have appeared abundant lately.', 'United had a run of 10 safety misfires in the two weeks leading up to the FAA’s increased scrutiny: A flight from Houston on March 4 was forced to return to the airport shortly after takeoff because its engine caught on fire. Several days later, a Boeing 777-200 in United’s fleet sat on the runway for over an hour before being deplaned because of a broken engine. The airline also had trouble with a missing panel on a plane’s fuselage; a Boeing 737 MAX that rolled onto the grass next to the taxiway; and another Boeing 777-200 that lost a tire midair, the debris of which landed in the airport’s parking lot, damaging several cars.', '""Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, our airline has experienced a number of incidents that are reminders of the importance of safety,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said in an email to customers. ""While they are all unrelated, I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus.""', 'United is familiar with navigating crises in the industry. The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002, unable to continue operating after the 9/11 attacks rocked trust in the U.S. aviation business. It underwent a record 1,150 day restructuring process that saw a 30% reduction in staff and 20% reduction in aircrafts. Despite emerging from bankruptcy in 2006, the airline, once the second-largest in the world, failed to make significant gains, growing only 3.8% since that time.', 'Today’s shareholder mistrust in United coincides with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun announcing his departure this year following months of mishaps across airlines and an FAA investigation which exposed dozens of issues within the manufacturer’s culture. Boeing’s shares jumped as much as 3.6% immediately following the news.', ""Boeing and United have more than just repeated cataclysms in common. They have a shared history dating back to the airline’s inception. Not only was Boeing Air Transport—first intended for international postal delivery—the precursor to United Airlines, but United Airlines helped Boeing skyrocket to success. In 1990, United bought the 1,832nd 737 aircraft, cementing its status as the world’s best-selling plane. The entities' fates were inextricably linked then, but there are key factors that could spare one of them as United undergoes an FAA probe of its own."", 'Despite United’s safety misfires occurring on Boeing planes—which make up about 80% of United’s fleet—airline consultant James Darcy of Darcy Strategic said that United likely needs to shoulder some of the blame.', ""“There's really nothing in these incidents that I've seen to date that would suggest that the accountability lies with Boeing, for each of them,” he said. “It's much more reasonable to do what the FAA has done, which is to turn to United and to say, ‘We need to understand if there's an underlying issue here.’”"", 'Given the wide gamut of United’s safety incidents, the mistakes don’t appear to be related and could be attributed to either the manufacturer or maintenance by the airline. A March 8 incident in which a United-operated Boeing 737 returned to the airport shortly after taking off was due to the engine ingesting a piece of bubble wrap.', '“That could have happened on any engine, any airplane, by any manufacturer,” Darcy said.', 'On the other hand, a hydraulic failure of a separate United flight could indicate a maintenance mistake or a premature failure of a part. It’s just too early to dole out blame, he argued.', 'The increased oversight also doesn’t mean that United has reason to panic: “In this industry, trouble is rarely portioned out to companies over time,” Darcy said. “It tends to be delivered in large, lump-sum payments.”', 'There’s also pressure on the FAA, which was heavily scrutinized in how it handled two Boeing 737 crashes in 2018 and 2019, which killed hundreds of passengers. After the accidents, the FAA reworked its oversight rules. That may mean lots of investigations these days, Darcy asserted, but it’s a correction to regulatory laxity that may have missed problems in the past.', ""“That's probably all good news for the flying public,” he said."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Despite the U.S. regional banking sector facing challenges in recent years and New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) issues not helping restore market confidence, PNC remains behind its peers. And this is regardless of its size and national reach. In addition, its unrealized losses—the core driver of regional bank weakness previously—remain below average.Despite its share price declining 5% YTD, resulting in a P/E of 11.6x, PNC performed well in Q4 due to the rally in Treasury markets.

During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has gained 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share, indicating a change of -1.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Aside from being a leader in the robotic surgery space, it's consistently profitable, and it has a clear roadmap to keep growing its revenue and earnings at a moderate pace for the foreseeable future."", ""There's little reason to doubt that it can execute on the same business plan that has carried the company to its present heights. In fact, there's now one more reason to buy the stock and hang on to it."", ""On March 14, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the fifth iteration of Intuitive's da Vinci surgical robotics suite. But this was far more than a few incremental improvements, and understanding why the launch constitutes a reason to buy the stock will require a little digging into the specifics of its features. While the company claims that the new edition has 150 updates and improvements, there are two that are particularly important in the context of its continued dominance in the robotic surgical space."", ""First, the surgeon's station has been redesigned, and it's now more fully configurable to suit different postures and body shapes. Those new features should make clinicians a bit more comfortable, which will probably improve their sentiment about the da Vinci overall. There's a decent chance they'll be more interested in evangelizing about the suite's capabilities as a result, which could drive marginally faster adoption rates, but based on the company's customer survey data, users were pretty happy already."", ""More importantly, the latest da Vinci model features a haptic feedback system that allows surgeons to physically feel on their hands when their robotic toolhead encounters pressure during an operation. The point of such a system is that it helps surgeons to apply precisely the correct amount of force while operating the robot, which could cut down on the amount of unintended trauma, potentially helping patients to experience better outcomes like faster recovery times. Per management, no other robotic or minimally invasive surgery technology has anything comparable yet, but it's obviously a feature that will be in demand moving forward."", ""So Intuitive is still innovating with its flagship product by introducing sought-after features that its customers are going to get a lot of mileage out of, and it won't likely be stopping."", ""After rising by 461% over the last 10 years, its trailing-12-month research and development (R&D) expenses are close to $1 billion, or around 14% of its annual revenue. But those R&D dollars aren't going solely to developing big product overhauls like the da Vinci 5. Instead, many of those resources are devoted to making new imaging systems, robotic toolheads, training programs, software packages, and other accessories."", 'All of those additional items can then be sold to hospitals that already own the main robotics suite, generating revenue. In total, secondary instruments and accessories brought in $4.2 billion last year, compared to $3.5 billion in 2022.', 'The launch of new editions of each product is favorable too; some of the more complicated new features in the da Vinci 5 will doubtlessly come with additional maintenance requirements. And customers dole out for maintenance services on a regular basis, leading to plenty of repeat sales for Intuitive. In 2023, those services yielded $1.1 billion in revenue, up from $1 billion a year prior.', ""Long term, investors should anticipate Intuitive continuing to build on its lucrative business model. It's strongly profitable, adding to its top and bottom lines, and it only holds $90 million in debt."", ""Over the last 10 years, by repeatedly successfully executing on the exact same model, its share price rose by 722%, dramatically outperforming the S&P 500's growth of 235%. The only potential obstacle to its doing a repeat performance over the coming 10 years is that competitors will eventually start to encroach on its market."", ""But today, there's no sign of other players being a problem. Most competitors are making specialized systems for applications like orthopedic surgery, which is to say that their products are not capable of performing as many different surgeries as the da Vinci. None have anywhere near the footprint of its 8,606 surgical suites deployed worldwide."", ""In other words, this company is going to continue reigning as the king of the robotic surgery market for a long time, and that's another reason to buy its stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

So it's not surprising that the company he leads, Berkshire Hathaway, has several excellent dividend stocks in its portfolio. Two of the best are Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), the world's largest payment services companies. Let's find out why these businesses are solid options for investors interested in passive income whose favorite holding period -- like Buffett's -- is forever."", ""Few people think about what happens once they swipe their credit cards in a store. The process is pretty intricate. Visa and Mastercard form the backbone of it. Both companies operate payment networks that allow credit-card transactions to be approved (or rejected) by connecting the bank that issued the card with that of the merchant's."", 'Visa and Mastercard pocket a fee for every transaction they help to facilitate. These two juggernauts have no notable competitors aside from one another. They practically run a duopoly that would be extremely challenging to topple, thanks to the network effects both companies benefit from. Take Visa: As of last year, there were more than 4 billion cards in circulation that had its logo.', ""Merchants who start new businesses and choose not to accept Visa cards as a payment method are turning away a significant percentage of their potential customers (at least in places where credit-card penetration is high). The more merchants take Visa, the more it becomes attractive to customers. Mastercard also benefits from this dynamic. That's partly why both companies continue to grow."", ""Visa and Mastercard have helped drive the move away from cash for years. As credit-card usage increases, both companies benefit from more transactions and higher revenue from fees. It's not surprising, then, that they have delivered excellent financial results in recent years."", ""Though lower than Visa's, Mastercard's revenue and earnings have grown faster. One key reason is that Mastercard has greater exposure in countries with lower credit-card penetration. In 2023, Mastercard generated $8.4 billion in sales from North America, an increase of 7% year over year. However, the company's revenue in international markets came in at $16.7 billion (almost 67% of its revenue), 16% higher than the previous year."", ""Visa separates its geographical segments into U.S. and international. In its fiscal 2023 ended Sept. 30, Visa's U.S. revenue rose 10% year over year to $14.1 billion. The company's international sales climbed 12% to $18.5 billion, or about 57% of its revenue. Visa's international segment also includes Canada, a country lumped into Mastercard's slower-growing North American unit."", 'These comparisons aside, Visa and Mastercard have plenty of growth opportunities because the trend of phasing out cash and check transactions should continue for a long time. While it may not seem so to some, many people still rely on cash, especially in regions with lower credit-card penetration. As Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said on the company\'s third-quarter 2023 earnings call: ""There remains a significant opportunity to convert cash and check to commercial card products.""', ""Visa's management has made the same point countless times, even emphasizing that in developed markets like the U.S., there remains a surprisingly large number of card-less transactions. These two giants should continue to ride this wave for the foreseeable future."", 'During the past decade, Visa and Mastercard have increased their payouts at an incredible pace.', ""Generating plenty of profits and free cash flow can allow a company to do that. Still, both have plenty of room for dividend hikes given their relatively modest cash payout ratios (both are about 20% of net income). Though neither sports a particularly high forward yield -- Visa's 0.73% beats out Mastercard's 0.55% -- through the combination of robust underlying operations, attractive growth opportunities, and competitive advantages, Visa and Mastercard look like no-brainer dividend stocks to buy and hold for good."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

In my view, two companies he owns should be added to your portfolio right now. There is one Buffett stock, however, that you should avoid if you're looking for investments that can outperform the S&P 500 over the long term."", ""Investors can buy Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) without hesitation. Combined, they make up less than 1% of Berkshire's portfolio, but they have been massive winners historically. In the past decade, Visa shares are up 410% and Mastercard shares are up 535%. "", 'Critics might knock these businesses because they experience slight cyclicality, given that consumer spending is tied to the state of the economy. Because these companies earn fees when cards are used as a method of payment, consumer spending patterns can impact the amount of revenue they generate.', 'But to their benefit, neither Visa nor Mastercard lends any money to borrowers. They simply provide the communications infrastructure that connects banks, consumers, and merchants.', 'And this has been a truly exceptional business model. Both companies operate massive two-sided payments platforms that bring together consumers and merchants across the world, leading to powerful network effects. Operating asset-light businesses means Visa and Mastercard consistently post operating margins in excess of 50%.', ""Their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios might not scream value. Visa trades at a P/E of 32.8, while Mastercard's is 40.8. Those are not, at first glance, cheap valuations."", 'However, an easy argument can be made that they deserve those premium valuations thanks to the qualities I just mentioned. With digital payments and cashless transactions still experiencing strong growth, Visa and Mastercard are set to continue their incredible financial performances.', ""One Warren Buffett business that investors should avoid is Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). This assertion may surprise you, especially considering that the beverage giant is Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-largest stock holding, with a position valued at $24 billion. But there are valid reasons to expect Coca-Cola won't perform well in the decade ahead."", ""One factor to consider is growth. The business reported sales of $46 billion in 2023. That was lower than its total in 2013. This is a mature enterprise that is already in more than 200 countries. There isn't a lot of potential for it to expand faster than population growth."", ""The stock isn't cheap, either. Shares trade at a P/E multiple of 24.4. That's significantly more expensive than they were just a few months ago, and it seems unwarranted considering Coca-Cola's revenue trends."", 'To its credit, though, Coca-Cola is an extremely safe, reliable, and stable business to own. Its powerful global brand provides it with an economic moat. And the company generated a superb 21% operating margin in Q4. This impressive profitability affords management the ability to pay a dividend that, at the current share price, yields 3.2%.', ""However, the stock's total return has significantly lagged the S&P 500's total return in the past 10 years. Given its low growth prospects and above-market P/E ratio, I don't have much confidence that its shares can outperform the broader market.

By definition, an island is a land mass surrounded by a body of water.\xa0', 'Although continents fall under this definition as well, they are still not considered islands due to their enormity. To put into perspective, Australia, the smallest continent with a land area of almost 7.7 million square kilometers, is more than three times the size of the largest island in the world — Greenland — which has a landmass of over 2.1 million square kilometers.\xa0', 'Officially, there are over 600,000 islands in the world, but this data is neither 100% accurate nor set in stone.', 'Officially, there are over 600,000 islands in the world, but this data is neither 100% accurate nor set in stone. Partly, this is due to the sheer number of Islands in the world, and the constant emergence of new islands due to natural processes like volcanic eruptions or through movement of tectonic plates. Furthermore, while many new islands appear over time, the old ones disappear as well through erosion and subsidence and natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis.', 'Apart from size, climate, and the kinds of organisms that inhabit them, these islands vary greatly in geographic features as well. Some islands, like the Aleutian Islands in the US state of Alaska, are cold and covered with ice throughout the year, while others, like Tahiti, are warm and on tropical waters.

For instance, Taiwan, an island country in East Asia, ranked 34th on the list of most visited countries in the world in 2024.\xa0', 'Out of the top 10 countries that heavily rely on tourism, six are island nations; island-rich countries leverage their natural assets to generate economic output through tourism. Small island nations are especially reliant on this industry because they have small economies and their excellent island beaches bring economic activity to the country. As evident by the number of countries with well-developed seaside facilities, beaches are one of the favorite spots for tourists.\xa0', 'Being an island country, Maldives is an ideal example of this. It is an island country with a population of 550,000 people dispersed across 185 islands, and it relies heavily on tourism to sustain its economy. In fact, tourism accounted for one-third of the country’s economy in the first half of 2023.

In February, the mortgage payment on a starter home in the largest metros cost $1,027 (+60.1%) more than the monthly rent in those markets, on average.

""Deciding whether to rent or buy often goes beyond a financial advantage though, and likely depends on a consumer\'s circumstances. Renters often prize flexibility while the biggest reasons homebuyers cite are that they want a place of their own and to be closer to family and friends. The financial scales have tipped monthly costs in favor of renting over buying, but it does not bring the benefit of housing wealth gains over time that owning does and movers should consider their long-term housing plans and personal situation as they make this decision.""', 'The overall advantage of renting continues to grow in most marketsIn February, the cost of buying a starter home in the top 50 metros was $1,027 (60.1%) higher than renting one; comparatively, the cost to buy was $865 higher than renting in February 2023 – a $162 higher monthly savings from renting compared to the prior year. The savings are mostly driven by declining rent prices and higher buying costs, especially interest rates – the 30-year fixed mortgage rate remained elevated at 6.78% in February 2024 compared to 6.26% 12 months ago.', 'The advantages of renting have become more pronounced across the top metros. Looking specifically at the top 10 metros that favor renting over buying, the average monthly costs for buying a starter home were $1,950 (95.6%) higher than rents – nearly double the cost. Those metros are mostly markets with a higher concentration of tech workers and high earners, where both the average rent and buy costs are higher than the national average.', 'Renting beats buying in all major metros, especially in south and west; five metros flip from last yearIn February, median rents fell across all unit sizes. Despite seven months of annual rent declines, median rents are still $252 (17.3%) higher than the same time in 2020, before the onset of the pandemic. Last February, 45 metros favored renting, but over the past 12 months Memphis, Tenn, Birmingham, Ala., Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Baltimore metros flipped from favoring buying to favoring renting. Four out of five of those markets were among the top markets seeing a high share of investor activity, which may have accelerated the growth of home prices there and increased the overall costs of buying a home, tilting those markets further toward favoring renting over buying.', 'Austin, Texas, where the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $3,695 – 141.5% more than the monthly rent of $1,530, for a monthly savings of $2,165 – topped the list of markets most favoring renting. Other top markets favoring renting over buying were Seattle, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Apple ceded the top spot to Microsoft, which now rules the roost with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Nvidia moved quickly up the charts to assume the No. 3 spot behind Apple with a market cap of $2.3 trillion, spurred on by its gold-standard AI chips. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with their own AI solutions -- are also members of this prestigious fraternity."", ""With Palantir Technologies' (NYSE: PLTR) market cap of just $54 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like a longshot to suggest that it is vying for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI and the company's expertise in the field suggest the odds are likely in Palantir's favor."", ""It wasn't very long ago that Palantir was relatively unknown outside of government agency circles. The data mining and AI specialist worked closely with the intelligence community in the U.S. to ferret out terrorists and prevent attacks before they happened. Palantir soon expanded beyond its original mandate, creating sophisticated built-to-order AI models for other government agencies and enterprises, helping discover valuable insights hidden deep within their data."", ""Palantir sprung into action when the market for generative AI exploded early last year, putting decades of expertise to work and developing a solution that could be broadly applied. The fruit of those labors is the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), the company's home-grown generative AI system, which Palantir developed in a matter of months. However, it's the company's go-to-market strategy that is spurring the greatest demand."", 'To capitalize on the opportunity, Palantir is holding boot camps. ""These immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations,"" management wrote in the company\'s fourth-quarter business update. Attendance at these sessions has been off the charts, as businesses have the opportunity to increase productivity or solve their most pressing business problems using generative AI solutions.', 'In October, Palantir laid out plans to hold 500 boot camps over the coming year. The company has since ""blown that goal out of the water,"" completing over 560 boot camps for 465 organizations in just four months.', ""That strong and growing demand is driving robust financial results. In the fourth quarter, Palantir's revenue of $608 million climbed 20% year over year and 9% sequentially. The biggest contributor was U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 70%, driven by demand for AIP. Palantir delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of profitability, making it eligible to join the S&P 500 index, which some market watchers believe that will happen this year."", ""It was management's outlook that really turned heads, as the company is forecasting at least 40% growth for the U.S. commercial segment -- which includes AIP -- over the coming year."", ""Palantir is in a unique position among AI providers. The company has a long history of AI expertise and a solid track record of fulfilling government contracts. That gives Palantir an edge in providing AI solutions to the U.S. government and its allies, and many believe the quest for sovereign AI among nations has already begun. Add to that the vast potential within enterprise businesses and the opportunity becomes clear -- but it won't happen overnight."", 'According to Wall Street, Palantir is poised to generate revenue of $2.71 billion in 2024 and $3.23 billion by 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 16. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to grow its revenue to roughly $60 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Revenue grew by 20% year over year in the most recent quarter. At that rate, it would take 16 years for Palantir to reach the $1 trillion threshold.', 'However, its U.S. commercial business -- fueled by generative AI -- grew by 70% in Q4, and management is guiding for at least 40% growth for the segment, so it could soon eclipse its other sales. Palantir has a tendency to under promise and over-deliver, so that estimate could well be conservative. If the company grew its revenue closer to 40%, it could be worth $1 trillion or more within a decade.', ""Estimates regarding generative AI are growing by leaps and bounds, but it's estimated the market will be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company."", ""If Palantir captures just a small part of that large and growing opportunity, it won't be long before it has secured membership in the $1 trillion club."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

The chipmaker was originally known for making gaming GPUs, but the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market over the past few years drove more companies to purchase its high-end data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks."", ""Nvidia's rally of more than 2,000% over the past five years boosted its market cap to $2.4 trillion and minted a lot of millionaires. But it's also driving more investors to search for the next big chipmaker that could follow Nvidia's footsteps."", ""Could that chipmaker be Micron (NASDAQ: MU), one of the world's top producers of DRAM and NAND memory chips? Let's review the key differences between Micron and Nvidia to see if Micron has a shot at replicating Nvidia's gains."", 'Micron designs its memory chips and manufactures them at its own foundries. That makes it different from Nvidia, which designs its chips but outsources its production to third-party foundries like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Micron operates that capital-intensive model at much lower margins than Nvidia.', ""Micron's memory chips also cost a lot less than Nvidia's GPUs, and it doesn't dominate its core markets in the same way as Nvidia. Micron is the world's third-largest supplier of DRAM chips and the fifth-largest supplier of NAND chips, but Nvidia is the leading producer of discrete GPUs by a wide margin. According to JPR, Nvidia controlled 80% of the market at the end of 2023, while AMD\xa0only held a 19% share."", 'Compared to Nvidia, Micron operates in a more commoditized market, has less pricing power against its competitors, and is more exposed to cyclical downturns as the memory chip market goes through its boom-and-bust cycles. However, Micron still produces denser and more power-efficient DRAM and NAND chips than its two largest competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix. That technological edge helps Micron lock in producers of higher-end PCs, mobile devices, and servers.', ""Micron endured a rough slowdown over the past two years as personal computer (PC) shipments declined in a post-pandemic market, the 5G upgrade cycle ended, and the macro headwinds curbed its chip sales to the enterprise and industrial markets. The Chinese government also barred its key infrastructure providers from buying Micron's memory chips. All of those challenges offset its stronger growth in the automotive and AI markets."", ""Micron's revenue grew 29% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in September 2020), but only rose 11% in fiscal 2022 and tumbled 49% in fiscal 2023. However, analysts expect its revenue to rise 56% in fiscal 2024 and 43% in fiscal 2025 as three tailwinds kick in. First, the PC and smartphone markets should gradually stabilize. Second, it should sell more chips to the enterprise, industrial, and automotive markets as the macro environment warms up again."", 'Lastly, the explosive growth of the generative AI market will drive more data centers to upgrade their memory chips alongside Nvidia\'s GPUs. During Micron\'s latest conference call, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the memory chip market was still in ""the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI"" and that those technologies would transform ""every aspect of business and society."" As an example, Mehrotra predicted that AI-enabled phones would ""carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non-AI flagship phones today.""', ""That's a bright outlook, but Micron's new growth cycle will still likely end in a few years. That's because companies drive up memory prices by buying a lot of chips when a certain market -- like smartphones, cloud data centers, and AI -- runs hot."", ""In response, Micron and its peers usually ramp up their production of new chips to satisfy that demand. But once the hot market cools, the chip shortage quickly turns into a supply glut as companies are left with an excess inventory of chips. That's why Micron's chip sales fell in 2019 and 2022 -- and why they'll likely drop again once the AI market matures."", ""This next growth cycle could last a lot longer than previous ones, but it will eventually end in a downturn. Nvidia will also face a similar slowdown, but its cyclical declines have been much milder than Micron's over the past decade. That's because Nvidia's dominance of the discrete GPU market grants it more pricing power during market downturns -- while Micron remains heavily exposed to the price cuts at its larger competitors."", ""Micron's stock trades at less than 4 times next year's sales, and it could run higher as its next growth cycle begins. If its valuations hold steady and it grows its revenue at a CAGR of 30% over the next five years, its stock could nearly quadruple. That would be an impressive gain, but it could end in a cyclical downturn and won't come close to replicating Nvidia's gains over the past five years. Simply put, Micron is still a promising semiconductor play -- but it's probably not the next Nvidia."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Now it’s backing away.', 'Five years ago, the media giant’s $71 billion 21st Century Fox deal gave it access to the Indian TV network Star, which hosts dozens of sports and entertainment channels, along with its streaming service Hotstar.', 'But the House of Mouse is now scaling back its ambitions in the country and taking a back seat to a local player. Last month, Disney said it would merge Star — once viewed as a crown jewel — with Indian telecom giant Reliance Industries in a joint venture estimated to be worth $8.5 billion. Disney will be a minority shareholder in the entity.', 'The decision highlights the challenges posed by the Indian entertainment market despite its allure of growth, multiple analysts told Yahoo Finance. While India offers the opportunity to reach millions of viewers, competition is fierce and success requires a significant amount of investment that US media companies may not be prepared to make as they grapple with cord-cutting challenges domestically.', 'India, which boasts a population of more than 1.4 billion, has become a media hotspot with projected TV and streaming-related revenue growth of 11% in 2024. That compares with much more muted growth in other developing countries, according to analytics firm Ampere Analysis.', 'But the market has been a hard one for US media companies to crack. First of all, it’s difficult for companies to create a direct relationship with Indian consumers, who largely rely on mobile operators to gain access to streaming services due to limited broadband infrastructure.', 'Indian consumers also have a relatively low willingness to pay for streaming platforms thanks to free, ad-supported models from local content providers and rampant piracy.', ""Local content providers — the top four being Star India, Viacom18, Sony, and Zee Entertainment — have largely been able to service India's vast population, which spans many different languages and dialects. Reliance, which has leveraged the success of its booming telecom business, has added yet another competitive layer to the diverse Indian TV market."", '""It\'s quite a fragmented media landscape,"" Neil Anderson, senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, told Yahoo Finance, noting local players have much larger ad businesses in addition to stronger production capabilities around entertainment and sports.', 'It’s not just local competitors taking market share. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) — two tech giants with significantly higher free cash flow levels compared to their legacy media counterparts — have made inroads with higher-income Indian consumers by offering localized content, said Mihir Shah, vice president of research firm Media Partners Asia.', '""The real story in India has been the growth of the middle- to higher-income consumer,"" Shah said. ""That\'s a segment which many of the tech platforms [like] Netflix and Prime Video are really dominating.""', 'The challenge, however, comes in penetrating the next 50 million households when income levels drop and more investment is needed to break through, he said.', 'All this has translated into tough times for Disney. The company lost the rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket matches through Hotstar to Reliance in 2022.', 'In another setback, Hotstar lost popular HBO content, including top programs like ""Succession,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" and ""The Last of Us."" Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the parent company of HBO, instead made the content available through the Indian streaming service JioCinema, which is owned by Viacom18.', 'In its latest fiscal year ending in September, Disney reported 37.6 million Hotstar subscribers, down a whopping 39% compared to the prior-year period.', 'On top of subscriber headwinds, foreign exchange has also been an issue.', ""The value of the Indian rupee, for example, has dropped roughly 20% since Disney's Fox acquisition in 2019. That has impacted metrics like average revenue per user (ARPU) for Hotstar subscribers, which is pennies on the dollar compared to where the metric stands for Disney's US-based subscribers."", 'During an earnings call in November, Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted to challenges in the Indian market but also said the company ""would like to stay"" and that its linear business ""actually does quite well"" in the country.', 'Industry observers told Yahoo Finance that the problems Disney faced in its core businesses likely played a role in the company’s decision to pull back.', ""In the years since the Fox merger, Disney’s parks business has slowed, its linear TV division has declined, and its streaming business, which launched at the end of 2019, is not yet profitable. Meanwhile, activist Nelson Peltz renewed his push to shake up Disney's board after the stock price hit multiyear record lows last year."", '""It\'s really about putting the oxygen mask on first and saying, \'What\'s core to our business?\'"" David Wisnia, partner and managing director of media and entertainment at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, told Yahoo Finance.', 'Disney’s not the only US media giant to reverse course on India recently. Just two weeks after Disney’s joint venture announcement, Paramount Global (PARA) said it was selling its 13% stake in Indian media company Viacom18 to Reliance for about $517 million.', '""These companies need to focus on their \'core,\' which is streaming,"" Wisnia said. ""So we have to fix that first and make sure that is a profitable venture before we invest in things that are not going to show profitability for years to come.""', 'That may mean a fast-growing market like India just isn’t a priority today for an industry already under significant pressure.', '“Legacy companies don’t have the luxury of time,” Wisnia stressed. “Their priorities are on immediate returns.”', 'Still, the long game is one Disney seems open to playing.', '""Disney is still choosing to have skin in the game,"" Media Partners Asia’s Shah said, referencing the company\'s 37% holding in its joint venture partnership with Reliance.

The obvious reason is that they supply recurring income. Many dividend payers also offer growth from a rising income stream and capital appreciation potential."", ""Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Oneok (NYSE: OKE), and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great options for income-seeking investors. Here's why those interested in dividends should take a closer look at this trio."", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): The energy sector is generally broken down into three segments: upstream (drilling), midstream (pipelines), and downstream (chemicals and refining). Two of them, the upstream and downstream, are highly volatile because they're largely driven by commodity prices. The other one, the midstream, produces consistent fee income and is, thus, highly reliable. Enterprise Products Partners operates in the midstream."", ""Enterprise owns a massive collection of vital North American energy infrastructure, helping to move energy around the world. Demand for oil and natural gas, and the products into which they get turned, is far more important to Enterprise's financial performance than the price of the products moving through its system. Even when oil prices are low, demand for energy tends to remain strong because of the importance the fuel plays in the global economy. Collecting small fees for the use of its pipelines, storage, processing, and transportation assets isn't sexy, but it is reliable."", ""The proof shows up in Enterprise's distribution, which has been increased annually for 25 years. Although distribution growth is likely to be slow, those looking to maximize the income their portfolios generate will appreciate the huge 7% yield on offer here. And that yield is backed by an investment grade-rated balance sheet and a strong 2023 distribution coverage ratio of 1.7. In other words, the risk of a distribution cut seems very low while the chance for more slow and steady increases seems very high."", ""Matt DiLallo (Oneok): Oneok has been one of the more durable dividend stocks in the midstream industry. The pipeline company has delivered dividend stability and growth for over a quarter century. While Oneok hasn't increased its payout every year, it has grown by over 150% in the last decade, significantly outpacing its peers. "", 'The company expects to continue increasing its dividend in the future. Oneok is coming off a transformational year. It closed its $18.8 billion acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners last September, creating a more diversified midstream company. The deal provided a meaningful initial financial boost and visible earnings growth from cost savings and other commercial synergies for the next few years. ', 'On top of that, the company has several high-return expansion projects under construction and in development. It recently approved a $355 million project to expand the capacity of its Elk Creek Pipeline, which should enter service in the first quarter of next year. It also expects to approve construction on its Saguaro Connector Pipeline this year. These and other projects will supply it with additional cash flow in the future. ', 'Oneok aims to return 75% to 85% of its cash flow from operations after capital expenses to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. It will retain the rest to strengthen its already solid balance sheet. The company expects to increase its dividend by 3% to 4% annually. It started 2024 off with a 3.7% dividend increase and now yields over 5%. With a high yield and visible growth, Oneok is ideal for those who like dividends. ', ""Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): The energy patch boasts several high-yield stocks, but if I were to pick one stock today, it's Brookfield Renewable. That's because this stock's track record reflects dividend stability, while its growth plans suggest that its dividend payout is primed to get bigger with time alongside its cash flows. In other words, Brookfield Renewable's yield isn't just high but it also looks safe and reliable. While Brookfield Renewable Partners stock yields 6.3% currently, shares of the corporate Brookfield Renewable Corporation yield 5.9%."", ""It's a simple business model: Brookfield Renewable acquires and operates renewable energy assets and sells the power it produces under long-term contracts. Since demand for electricity is fairly resilient to economic cycles, the company can generate stable and predictable cash flows. In fact, nearly 90% of Brookfield Renewable's cash flows are contracted, and its average contract duration is 13 years. Moreover, the power tariff is indexed to inflation and can therefore boost the company's revenue steadily."", ""So for example, Brookfield Renewable expects inflation escalation to boost its funds from operations (FFO) per unit by 2% to 3% annually between 2023 and 2028. Add margin improvements, development pipeline, and potential acquisitions, and the company's FFO per unit could easily grow by 10% or more annually during the period. That should give Brookfield Renewable enough leeway to increase its dividend every year by anything between 5% to 9%. Given the company's strong balance sheet, a humongous pipeline of projects, and commitment to dividend growth, that means shareholders could earn double-digit percentage returns annually from Brookfield Renewable stock. That makes for a pretty compelling case to consider this high-yield stock today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like ONEOK (NYSE:OKE), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' See our latest analysis for ONEOK ', 'If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that ONEOK has grown EPS by 48% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.', 'Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. We note that while EBIT margins have improved from 13% to 20%, the company has actually reported a fall in revenue by 21%.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for ONEOK's future EPS 100% free."", ""Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions."", 'The US$56k worth of shares that insiders sold during the last 12 months pales in comparison to the US$2.0m they spent on acquiring shares in the company. This bodes well for ONEOK as it highlights the fact that those who are important to the company having a lot of faith in its future. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President Pierce Norton for US$1.5m worth of shares, at about US$60.96 per share.', ""Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for ONEOK is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$116m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of ONEOK but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""Shareholders have more to smile about than just insiders adding more shares to their already sizeable holdings. That's because on our analysis the CEO, Pierce Norton, is paid less than the median for similar sized companies. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like ONEOK, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m."", ""ONEOK's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.1m in the year leading up to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making."", ""ONEOK's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. What's more, insiders own a significant stake in the company and have been buying more shares. These factors seem to indicate the company's potential and that it has reached an inflection point. We'd suggest ONEOK belongs near the top of your watchlist.

STRL, Fluor Corporation FLR, and Quanta Services, Inc. PWR, is capitalizing on robust global shifts toward infrastructure modernization, energy transition, and heightened national security concerns.

The company anticipates a varied portfolio of federal projects spanning road and bridge renovations, water management, harbor and port enhancements, and upgrades to the power grid, all of which are anticipated to fuel growth throughout 2024.Robust Rental Revenue Growth: Backed by the company’s multi-year tailwinds in infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power, along with strong customer demand, United Rentals has been witnessing widespread growth in rental revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2023, rental revenues grew 13.5% to $3.12 billion, year over year.

Indeed, shares of AMD have soared 179% since January 2023.', ""Like Nvidia, AMD designs advanced semiconductors that can be used to train large language models. Its latest AI-focused offering is the MI300X chip, unveiled in December 2023. So far, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms have all expressed interest in using the chip, which offers an alternative to the current AI workhouse, Nvidia's H100 chip."", ""The MI300X could help AMD secure a key foothold in the AI accelerator market, particularly considering its cost. It sells for around $10,000 to $15,000, well below the H100's price of $40,000."", 'With the first deliveries of the MI300X happening right now, it will take some time to see what the demand for the chip looks like. However, AMD Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su has expressed optimism, both for the MI300X and the overall AI market. Back in December she predicted that the market for AI chips would hit $400 billion by 2027, up from around $40 billion in 2023. If her prediction is anywhere near accurate, AMD investors will have lots to smile about in the coming years.', 'Next up is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), an under-the-radar AI stock if ever there was one.', 'The company is probably best known for being one of the classic ""tech bubble"" stocks of the early 2000s. The database software giant\'s stock skyrocketed during the first wave of internet adoption in the late 1990s before crashing 84% in the bear market of 2001-2003.', 'Nevertheless, Oracle is now back and riding high thanks to its data center business.

Indeed, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Safra Catz sounded a very optimistic note, saying that the company is likely to surpass its goal of $65 billion in annual revenue by 2026. Moreover, Chairman Larry Ellison highlighted that soaring spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft is moving Oracle's needle."", 'In short, the AI wave is helping Oracle find its mojo once again -- and investors should take note.', 'Last is Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), the company at the forefront of AI-driven big data analysis.', ""Some investors might find Palantir's business model difficult to understand. In a nutshell, Palantir helps organizations run their operations more efficiently. The company does this through multiple AI-powered software platforms that analyze enormous data sets, recognize patterns, and offer solutions."", ""Financially, it's clear Palantir is racking up wins. Its customer count, revenue, net income, and free cash flow are all growing. Moreover, the company is starting to execute a pivot toward the private sector after getting much of its early-stage revenue from government contracts."", 'Even now, Palantir generates more revenue from governmental entities ($1.2 billion in 2023) than from commercial customers ($1.0 billion in 2023).', ""However, that's likely to change. Palantir's commercial revenue is growing at around 20% year over year, while government revenue is growing at 14%. If that trend holds, Palantir's commercial revenue will surpass its government revenue by 2027."", ""At any rate, investors shouldn't sleep on Palantir.

These headwinds continued into 2023, with a slight decline in global tech spending and increasing layoffs. Nonetheless, economists are now less concerned about the risk of recession, with analysts optimistic about modest growth potential in the tech sector for 2024. Despite ongoing global and economic uncertainties, Deloitte suggests that it is time to refocus on innovation and growth. Their 2024 technology industry outlook identifies key trends and strategies expected to shape tech leaders' priorities, including (1) Aiming for a comeback with support from cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity technologies; (2) Balancing globalization with self-reliance to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes; (3) Preparing for growth opportunities with generative AI applications; and (4) Addressing regulatory challenges as governments worldwide assess the impacts of tech platforms on businesses and consumers."", 'Ken Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, commented:\xa0', '“In 2023 the tech industry navigated global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions, while building widespread expectation around the potential of AI. The opportunity for the year ahead is clear. By putting AI at the center of their strategies, tech businesses could leapfrog competitors who were previously ahead, not only by accelerating their transformation journeys but also repositioning operations to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.”', 'Similarly, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, siad:\xa0', '“Notwithstanding regulatory hurdles associated with AI deals, huge potential remains. The platform nature of today’s tech businesses means there will be many attractive companies with business models based on existing AI ecosystems. The optimal way to expand will be through a blend of small- to medium-sized acquisitions, corporate investments and partnerships, that will help companies access intellectual property and the skills needed to develop new propositions quickly.”', ""In 2024, the technology market offers numerous promising opportunities, including the rapid expansion of the Asia Pacific region, high demand for software, the potential of generative AI, and the increasing focus on green and digital innovation. Economic conditions are expected to improve with lower energy prices, stabilizing supply chains, and decreasing inflation. Forrester forecasts global tech spending to reach $4.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.3% growth compared to 2023's 3.5%. The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the Asia Pacific region as a leader in growth, with India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China expected to see significant real GDP growth in 2024. India, a major exporter of technology services, is projected to experience a 9.5% growth in domestic and government tech spending. In China, the digital economy is anticipated to contribute 41.5% to GDP. North America is forecasted to grow by 5.4%, with financial services and healthcare leading tech spending growth. Software and IT services are expected to dominate US tech spending, capturing 60% by 2027. The US government is allocating $25 billion to emerging technologies in 2024 through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act agencies. Europe is expected to grow by 5.1%, rebounding from a challenging 2023. However, further acceleration of tech spending is needed to meet digital technology enterprise targets.\xa0"", ""Forrester advises companies to prioritise investments in software, generative AI, and green and digital innovation. Software revenues, including custom and off-the-shelf solutions, are projected to grow at double-digit rates, fueled by robust demand for cloud services. Investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain. Large consulting firms are pivoting towards AI solutions delivery, with firms like Capgemini planning multi-billion-dollar investments in generative AI. Partnerships between generative AI companies and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle facilitate access to computing power. Additionally, companies are urged to focus on green and digital innovation, as initiatives like Europe's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact aim for carbon neutrality in data centers by 2030. Innovative firms investing in green and digital initiatives experience accelerated revenue growth, while increased digital technology investment leads to enhanced productivity growth."", ""Cathie Wood is always mentioned when the subject on hand is innovation. In an interview last month with OPTO, Wood commented that the technologies that are making waves today, their roots were laid down 20 years ago, at the end of the Telecom bubble. She referred to multiomic sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, noting that these technologies are now ready for prime time, with growth rates ranging from 20%-50% per year. Cathie Wood expects a convergence of these five major technologies at one point, which will result in 'super exponential growth'. Already strong growth rates will speed up further, resulting in enormous productivity gains and potential for wealth generation. She stated that AI is a huge catalyst for productivity gains, and it is accelerating the efficiency of the other major market technologies. Wood also mentioned that robotics will lead to massive increases in productivity, especially humanoid robotics, as they take over dangerous and extremely mundane tasks from humans."", ""According to Cathie Wood, robo taxis or autonomous taxi platforms are likely to experience the largest revenue boom as three technologies converge, which are robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. She highlighted that autonomous vehicles have a tremendous revenue opportunity of $8-$10 trillion globally over the next 5 to 10 years. In this context, she sees huge profit margins for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a platform provider for autonomous vehicles. Among the Magnificent 7, Wood sees positive outcomes for Tesla due to autonomous vehicles and Meta Platforms since it is well-integrated into the AI ecosystem and is big on social commerce. However, for Amazon and Google, Wood sees trouble since she noted that AI will disintermediate data aggregators at point. She further pointed out the boom in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, noting that Bitcoin rose 40% last year when Silicon Valley Banks and others banks collapsed. The SEC's green light with the crypto ETFs also helped the industry. This will also impact Coinbase positively in the long run, as per Cathie Wood.

Even major US financial institutions faced challenges throughout 2023. In 2024, a\xa0global economic slowdown and macroeconomic weakness fuelled by high interest rates are expected to stir up problems for the banking industry. Although governments worldwide are implementing measures to control inflation, many factors still pose a risk to economic prosperity, including supply chain disruptions, changing trade relationships, geopolitical tensions, and extreme weather events. IMF's latest forecasts indicate global economic growth of only 3% in 2024, with developed economies showing modest growth rates and emerging economies experiencing notable growth.\xa0"", ""According to a Deloitte report, banks globally will face challenges that impact their revenue generation and cost management in 2024. High interest rates have increased net interest income, especially in the United States and Canada, while also driving up funding costs and reducing margins consequently. The global banking industry is now faced with an uphill battle to control deposit costs while customer expectations and market competition skyrocket. Loan growth is forecasted to be modest, given the high borrowing costs and overall macroeconomic dynamics, with banks likely to maintain restrictive credit lending policies. While consumer spending is strong, demand for credit card and auto loans is predicted to remain robust, while demand for corporate loans may temporarily weaken before likely recovering later this year. Additionally, climate change considerations are largely impacting credit availability and loan demand. The blend of higher deposit costs, lower policy rates, and limited loan potential may affect banks' ability to maintain strong net interest margins in 2024.

Macroeconomic factors such as growth, inflation, and Federal Reserve policy will likely remain pivotal for the financial sector and the broader market. Recent events at Silicon Valley Bank underscored the importance of deposit quality in the current environment. With interest rates rising, depositors now have higher-yielding options for their excess cash, making deposits more susceptible to potential flight.

The chipmaker was originally known for making gaming GPUs, but the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market over the past few years drove more companies to purchase its high-end data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks."", ""Nvidia's rally of more than 2,000% over the past five years boosted its market cap to $2.4 trillion and minted a lot of millionaires. But it's also driving more investors to search for the next big chipmaker that could follow Nvidia's footsteps."", ""Could that chipmaker be Micron (NASDAQ: MU), one of the world's top producers of DRAM and NAND memory chips? Let's review the key differences between Micron and Nvidia to see if Micron has a shot at replicating Nvidia's gains."", 'Micron designs its memory chips and manufactures them at its own foundries. That makes it different from Nvidia, which designs its chips but outsources its production to third-party foundries like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Micron operates that capital-intensive model at much lower margins than Nvidia.', ""Micron's memory chips also cost a lot less than Nvidia's GPUs, and it doesn't dominate its core markets in the same way as Nvidia. Micron is the world's third-largest supplier of DRAM chips and the fifth-largest supplier of NAND chips, but Nvidia is the leading producer of discrete GPUs by a wide margin. According to JPR, Nvidia controlled 80% of the market at the end of 2023, while AMD\xa0only held a 19% share."", 'Compared to Nvidia, Micron operates in a more commoditized market, has less pricing power against its competitors, and is more exposed to cyclical downturns as the memory chip market goes through its boom-and-bust cycles. However, Micron still produces denser and more power-efficient DRAM and NAND chips than its two largest competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix. That technological edge helps Micron lock in producers of higher-end PCs, mobile devices, and servers.', ""Micron endured a rough slowdown over the past two years as personal computer (PC) shipments declined in a post-pandemic market, the 5G upgrade cycle ended, and the macro headwinds curbed its chip sales to the enterprise and industrial markets. The Chinese government also barred its key infrastructure providers from buying Micron's memory chips. All of those challenges offset its stronger growth in the automotive and AI markets."", ""Micron's revenue grew 29% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in September 2020), but only rose 11% in fiscal 2022 and tumbled 49% in fiscal 2023. However, analysts expect its revenue to rise 56% in fiscal 2024 and 43% in fiscal 2025 as three tailwinds kick in. First, the PC and smartphone markets should gradually stabilize. Second, it should sell more chips to the enterprise, industrial, and automotive markets as the macro environment warms up again."", 'Lastly, the explosive growth of the generative AI market will drive more data centers to upgrade their memory chips alongside Nvidia\'s GPUs. During Micron\'s latest conference call, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the memory chip market was still in ""the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI"" and that those technologies would transform ""every aspect of business and society."" As an example, Mehrotra predicted that AI-enabled phones would ""carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non-AI flagship phones today.""', ""That's a bright outlook, but Micron's new growth cycle will still likely end in a few years. That's because companies drive up memory prices by buying a lot of chips when a certain market -- like smartphones, cloud data centers, and AI -- runs hot."", ""In response, Micron and its peers usually ramp up their production of new chips to satisfy that demand. But once the hot market cools, the chip shortage quickly turns into a supply glut as companies are left with an excess inventory of chips. That's why Micron's chip sales fell in 2019 and 2022 -- and why they'll likely drop again once the AI market matures."", ""This next growth cycle could last a lot longer than previous ones, but it will eventually end in a downturn. Nvidia will also face a similar slowdown, but its cyclical declines have been much milder than Micron's over the past decade. That's because Nvidia's dominance of the discrete GPU market grants it more pricing power during market downturns -- while Micron remains heavily exposed to the price cuts at its larger competitors."", ""Micron's stock trades at less than 4 times next year's sales, and it could run higher as its next growth cycle begins. If its valuations hold steady and it grows its revenue at a CAGR of 30% over the next five years, its stock could nearly quadruple. That would be an impressive gain, but it could end in a cyclical downturn and won't come close to replicating Nvidia's gains over the past five years. Simply put, Micron is still a promising semiconductor play -- but it's probably not the next Nvidia."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

The company is benefiting from a favorable travel demand environment, owing to growing demand for global leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends remains a major tailwind.Solid momentum in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth. Furthermore, strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is a major positive. Also, strong momentum across the merchant, and advertising and other businesses are other positives.Additionally, growing alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are tailwinds for the company. However, the declining trend in agency bookings is negatively affecting its top-line growth. Also, intensifying online travel competition remains a serious risk.(You can read the full research report on Booking Holdings here >>>)Mitsubishi UFJ's shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past year (+68.7% vs. +33.0%). The first nine months of fiscal 2023 results show a rise in loan and deposit balances and fees and commissions, while net interest income (NII) declined.A large deposit balance from a broad customer base boosts its liquidity position and aid its inorganic growth. MUFG's asset management strategy aims to enhance its investment capabilities in alternative investment and credit space. Also, the company's capital strength aids its capital distribution activities.Yet, amid Japan's low interest rate policy, MUFG's top-line growth will likely continue to be hurt.

It anticipates the pricing of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and NAND chips will keep increasing next year, hence improving its revenues.The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI server causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Paccar (PCAR), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if PCAR is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this truck maker holds up."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment.

Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.71% compares favorably with the industry's 2.61% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Paccar have risen 26.73%, and are up 77.04% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.46% and 34.64%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to PCAR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PCAR is currently averaging 2,529,442 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PCAR.', ""Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PCAR's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.72 to $8.13 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PCAR is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A.

These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations.', 'Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We believe excluding the impact of these charges better enables users of our financial statements to view and evaluate underlying business performance from the perspective of management. We do not consider these costs when evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards.', 'One-Time Compensation Payment', 'We supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of a one-time payment made to certain U.S.-based, non-union part-time supervisors following the ratification of our labor agreement with the Teamsters.

We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with plan amendments and short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors."", 'Free Cash Flow', 'We calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'As you can see below, Occidental Petroleum had US$19.0b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$1.43b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$17.6b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$9.15b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$34.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.43b and US$3.27b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$39.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$56.6b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Occidental Petroleum has net debt of just 1.3 times EBITDA, indicating that it is certainly not a reckless borrower. And this view is supported by the solid interest coverage, with EBIT coming in at 7.4 times the interest expense over the last year. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Occidental Petroleum if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 56% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.', ""Occidental Petroleum's EBIT growth rate and level of total liabilities definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that Occidental Petroleum is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Nicknamed the ""Bond King,"" Gross ran Pimco\'s Total Return Bond Fund for decades, enriching himself (he\'s worth an estimated $2.5 billion) and investors in that fund. ', ""Today, Gross dabbles more in equities. One asset class he likes is master limited partnerships (MLPs). While MLPs can complicate your taxes (they send K-1s instead of 1099-DIVs), they supply tax-deferred income, which Gross likes. His current favorite is Western Midstream Partners (NYSE: WES). Here's why. "", 'Bill Gross has been highlighting the value proposition of MLPs for a while now. He noted that the oil and gas pipeline operators offer hefty dividend yields, with much of that income tax deferred. That makes them compelling investment opportunities, especially in today\'s seemingly overheated market, where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 trade at lofty multiples (23.5 times earnings for the S&P 500 and over 31 times for the Nasdaq). Investors have driven up the value of most stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" due to euphoria over AI and other catalysts. ', 'On the other hand, MLPs are relatively unknown. They fly under the radar of many institutional investors because legal constraints prevent most mutual funds and ETFs from investing in these entities. Despite that, Gross pointed out: ""Higher oil prices have led to 28% average gains, along with 9% to 10% tax-deferred yields since 2023. Better total return than the S&P 500 over the same time period."" ', 'Given the more recent outperformance, Gross is more cautious about MLPs as a whole. However, he recently said: ""I do like Western Midstream, though. The market doesn\'t seem to know about its recent 40% hike in its dividend and its current yield of 10.1% -- tax deferred."" ', 'Western Midstream Partners is an MLP originally formed by oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum to support its operations. It became part of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) after the oil giant acquired Anadarko in 2019. ', 'The companies signed agreements in December of that year to enable Western Midstream to operate as a stand-alone business. Occidental still owns its general partner, a 49.8% interest in the MLP, and a 2% interest in Western Midstream Operating (a company the MLP controls at a 98% ownership interest). ', 'Occidental is currently exploring the sale of its interest in Western Midstream Partners. A sale of some or all of its interest in the MLP could give it the cash to repay the debt it plans to take on to fund its $12 billion acquisition of CrownRock. ', ""However, a potential sale isn't why Bill Gross likes Western Midstream. He noted that the MLP recently hiked its base distribution level by nearly 40% to at least $3.20 per unit this year. The MLP sees the potential to pay out $3.50 per unit this year, a more than 50% increase. "", ""Fueling that increase is the company's capital recycling strategy. Last year, it closed its $885 million all-cash acquisition of Meritage Midstream Services. That deal significantly transformed and expanded its existing Powder River Basin operations. The highly accretive deal initially drove its view that it could increase its annual distribution by $0.05 per unit. "", ""The MLP has since agreed to sell several non-core assets for $790 million, including $400 million of joint venture interests, to fellow MLP Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD). That deal will be immediately accretive to Enterprise's cash flow per share. Because of that, it should give the MLP the fuel to continue growing its big-time distribution."", 'Meanwhile, the sales will give Western Midstream the cash to repay debt, repurchase units, and fund organic expansion projects. Those catalysts will drive material free cash flow growth, enabling the MLP to significantly increase its distribution. ', ""As Gross pointed out, the new distribution yield will be around 10%. That's several times above the S&P 500's current dividend yield of around 1.3% (and higher than rival MLPs like Enterprise Product Partners' current 7.1% yield). Further, that monster income stream is largely tax-deferred until investors sell their MLP units. "", ""That big-time distribution could continue rising as Western Midstream grows its free cash flow. That, of course, assumes the MLP remains an independent publicly traded company following Occidental's sale. Another pipeline company like Enterprise Products Partners or a private equity fund might seek to acquire the entire company rather than simply buying Occidental's stake. However, if they did, they'd likely need to offer a premium to the current market price to get a deal done."", ""Bill Gross likes MLPs, especially Western Midstream Partners. The company is significantly hiking its already high-yielding distribution, which could continue in the future as it grows its free cash flow. Meanwhile, there's an additional upside catalyst from its acquisition potential.

The meeting will be virtual and can be streamed on the company’s website, though participation is limited to shareholders. It begins at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.', 'Amy Miles, Norfolk Southern’s (NYSE: NSC) board chair, is the signatory of the letter aimed at the shareholders who will determine whether the various entities that operate under the name Ancora Catalyst Institutional will prevail in its effort to place eight candidates chosen by the investor group on the company’s board.', 'Those candidates include John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, cable news pundit and unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate in 2016. It also includes Allison Landry, a director at XPO (NYSE: XPO) who was a longtime equity analyst covering transportation at Credit Suisse. At 44, Landry is the youngest of the insurgent candidates nominated by Ancora.', '“In 2023, Norfolk Southern took the necessary steps to restore service, improve safety, and protect our franchise,” Miles wrote in the letter. “We worked together with our customers and economic development partners to facilitate broad-based industrial development and create a robust 2024 projects pipeline to serve a diverse customer portfolio, while driving productivity so we can deliver profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value as the market improves.”', 'Norfolk Southern isn’t sitting still prior to the vote. Last week, it announced it had paid $25 million to CPKC (NYSE: CP), the combination of the former Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern railroads, to release John Orr from his position as chief transformation officer at CPKC to become chief operating officer at Norfolk Southern. There were also nonspecific considerations for the Meridian Speedway, a joint venture track between Louisiana and Mississippi where Norfolk Southern and CPKC are partners.', 'Orr came out of the Kansas City Southern side of the merger between the two Class 1 railroads. Earlier in his career he had worked at Canadian National (NYSE: CNI).', 'In a report on the change, Amit Mehrotra, who heads the transportation team at Deutsche Bank, said Orr had been passed over for an earlier promotion to COO at CN. Orr is replacing Paul Duncan, who had only been in the job for a year.', 'Mehrotra noted that Orr will be COO No. 3 in as many years at Norfolk Southern. “This level of churn in such an important position at a company of NSC’s size and scale is highly unusual,” Mehrotra wrote. But he added, “Based on our conversations with many industry stakeholders, it appears John Orr is a well regarded operating executive, though with limited COO experience.”', 'In its report last week on Norfolk Southern, Jason Seidl of TD Cowen noted that Ancora has vowed to put Jamie Boychuk into the COO role at NS if it lands its eight board members. “We ultimately think that Ancora’s board demands are not an ‘all or nothing’ proposition, and believe the most likely outcome of the proxy fight will be a deal that meets somewhere in the middle,” Seidl wrote.', 'Boychuk was announced as Ancora’s proposed COO last month at the same time Ancora said its proposed CEO for Norfolk Southern would be Jim Barber Jr. Barber had been COO of UPS (NYSE: UPS); Boychuk had been executive vice president at CSX (NASDAQ: CSX).', 'The annual meeting will feature the election of 13 directors overall. Of the candidates for those slots, only current CEO Alan Shaw is an insider.', 'Two of the proposed directors put forth by the company are new: Richard Anderson and Mary Kathryn Heitkamp, better known as Heidi, a former U.S. senator elected to one term as a Democrat from the deep red state of North Dakota.', 'Anderson has a long record running transportation-related companies. He has been CEO of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, had several jobs at Continental Airlines and most recently was president and CEO at Amtrak.', 'In her letter, Miles addressed the railroad’s continuing work in the wake of the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment in February 2023 that sent massive plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forced evacuations of thousands of local residents.', '“Your Board of Directors is highly engaged and will continue to actively oversee management’s execution of our strategy and response to East Palestine,” Miles wrote. “We will continue to work with federal, state, and local agencies and regulators to respond to the East Palestine derailment.”', 'Ancora, in its latest proxy filing, summed up its views on the need to replace Shaw and now new COO Orr, though he was not identified in the letter, and to make changes on the board.', '“We believe that prompt changes in Norfolk Southern’s leadership and strategy are necessary to allow the Company to meet its full potential and produce enhanced value for its customers, employees, communities and shareholders,” it wrote. “For many years, Norfolk Southern has lagged behind its peers in terms of operational metrics, safety and financial performance. The Company’s recent record, particularly the derailments of Norfolk Southern-operated trains in February 2023 in East Palestine, Ohio and on March 2, 2024 in Lower Saucon Township, Pennsylvania, reinforces the urgent need for a shareholder-driven constitution of the Company’s Board of Directors and the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer.”', 'The Lower Saucon derailment spilled fuel into the Lehigh River but was not on the scale of the East Palestine derailment. Trains were running through the site two days after the derailment.', 'In terms of stock market performance, if Norfolk Southern is compared to CSX, its Class 1 rival in the Eastern half of the country, neither has done particularly well. Norfolk Southern’s stock performance is essentially flat since the start of 2021 but is up more than 26% in the past 52 weeks.', 'CSX opened up 2021 at just under $32 a share and is now at about $37.20. In the past 52 weeks, it is up about 31.8%.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'Further appeals to block AB5 from California trucking seen as a long shot', 'Union Pacific CEO defends safety practices without mentioning key critic', 'SEC backs off on requiring companies to report scope 3 emissions', 'The post Vote on insurgent effort at Norfolk Southern set for May 9 appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

It is the market share leader in a large, expanding industry. And Coke capitalizes on that premium position, as illustrated by attractive financial metrics like profit margin and cash flow. Compare the beverage giant's 28% operating profit against rival PepsiCo's 14% rate, for example."", 'Coke is adept at converting most of its earnings into the resources that fund a rising dividend payment.

""We are very pleased with our 2023 financial performance,"" CEO Cliff Pemble told investors in late February.', ""The company is highly profitable, even though its margins have contracted from their pandemic records.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Food Dive newsletter.', 'After Coca-Cola abruptly announced it would shutter production of its Honest tea offering in May of 2022, few understood the lucrative market opportunity that would open up better than Seth Goldman.', 'The entrepreneur helped co-found Honest 24 years earlier and remained convinced there was still a thriving market for an organic, less sweet tea. Goldman wasted no time, announcing two weeks later plans to introduce a then-unnamed brand to fill the void. In September of that year, Just Ice Tea made its way to store shelves — bringing with it many of the same characteristics that made Honest tea a success.', 'Today, Goldman’s prophecy has come to fruition. Sales of Just Ice, which totaled $16 million in 2023, are forecast to top $20 million this year. It’s a remarkable rate of growth for a young brand poised to generate the same amount in sales after just 18 months on the market versus the eight years it took Honest to reach the same threshold.', ""“We certainly expect to capture the volume that Honest tea had,” Goldman said. “And I'd say we're well on our way to doing that. But then the question is, ‘Okay, now, how do we sort of propel the business beyond where Honest was, what are the opportunities and spaces?’ ”"", 'Just Ice’s rapid rise reflects favorable trends Goldman identified when he launched the brand.', 'The market for a product like Just Ice — which has fewer calories since it doesn’t use sugar, is Fairtrade certified and organic — has grown exponentially from what it was when Honest first hit the market in 1998.', 'Goldman and his team have a favorable reputation from their time at Honest that has followed them to Just Ice. They also have close relationships with growers, manufacturers, suppliers and retailers. It’s not uncommon for stores to devote shelf space to Just Ice before even seeing or trying it, Goldman said.', 'Just Ice so far has nine tea flavors on the market, several of which are reincarnations of the most popular Honest tea offerings, including Honey Green and Peach Oolong. The brand is part of Eat the Change, a four-year-old startup making environmentally friendly, nutrient-dense snacks from carrots, mushrooms and other plant ingredients.', 'Goldman said they are devoting time and resources to expanding the brand into geographies where Just Ice doesn’t have a strong presence and growing distribution into mainstream retailers. Just Ice is already the best-selling tea brand at Whole Foods and other natural channels.', 'Another promising growth opportunity for Just Ice is the addition of aluminum cans last month as a packaging option. Previously the brand only bottled its beverages in glass.', 'Aluminum cans provide Just Ice with an inroad to convenience stores and food service establishments that typically shun glass. The material also is more conducive to club stores or online channels because of its lower weight. Finally, recycling for aluminum is more established and better understood by the public than glass, making its green footprint more attractive to individuals who factor this into their buying decisions.', 'With a dozen SKUs in its portfolio — a large number for a brand as young as Just Ice — and now aluminum cans, Goldman said the brand is prioritizing increasing consumer awareness and distribution before adding new products to the mix.', '“We have to make sure everything we have works and has earned its place on the shelf,” he said.', 'The rapid expansion of the brand, at least initially, was built largely on a desire to capture the market left from Honest’s departure that executives were confident was still there. Eat Just didn’t have the luxury of gradually rolling out Just Ice.', '“We knew it was going to require an aggressive move and determination to capitalize on it,” Goldman said.', 'While Just Ice has similarities to Honest, it does possess some notable differences.', 'Just Ice uses agave instead of sugar, part of Eat the Change’s support of biodiversity in agriculture. It also eschews plastic in favor of glass bottles and aluminum to improve the environmental footprint of its packaging.', 'Despite the parallels, there is one that hasn’t cropped up for Goldman, at least for now: a sale. Goldman and Barry Nalebuff sold a 40% stake in Honest tea in 2008 to Coca-Cola for $43 million with an option that was exercised three years later to purchase the rest of the company for an undisclosed amount. He hasn’t thought about a sale for Just Ice, and said he hasn’t been approached by anyone.', ""“I’m not wasting a lot of energy or time on that,” he said. “We're focused on building a brand ... It’s so early in what we're doing that it's hard to even conceive of that.”""]"

Weyerhaeuser remains optimistic about its performance due to favorable demographics, a decade of underbuilding, and historically low inventory for new and existing homes.Let’s check out the factors influencing the company’s performance in the future.', ""Rising Spending on Carbon/ESG Projects: Governments and businesses across the globe are making efforts on climate change and aim to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2040. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts.More capital inflows for carbon/ESG-related projects are likely to prove beneficial for Weyerhaeuser. For the Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) business, Weyerhaeuser continues to remain engaged with high-quality developers for renewable energy and carbon capture and storage opportunities across its acreage. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act should drive incremental demand for these markets and further support NCS's growth strategy.On Sep 20, 2023, the company announced receiving approval for its very first Improved Forest Management carbon credit project in Maine from the American Carbon Registry. The project covers approximately 50,000 acres, with an initial issuance of nearly 32,000 credits, which is expected to generate 475,000 credits over a 20-year crediting period.For the carbon capture and sequestration business, the company expects solid progress on the projects it had announced with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Exxon, both expected to be online in late 2025/2026. It is positioned to determine a goal of growing the Natural Climate Solutions business to $100 million in EBITDA by 2025-end.Improving Housing, Repair & Remodel Activity to Boost Demand: Residential construction, as well as repair and remodel market activity, is improving gradually. This is supported by steady demand from the professional segment and a normalized do-it-yourself segment to a pre-pandemic level.In the near term, Weyerhaeuser expects stable demand from the repair and remodel segment, most likely attributed to lower building product prices and customers' demand for remodeling homes instead of purchasing new houses. WY remains bullish for the long term as most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including solid home equity levels and an aging housing stock.Operational Excellence to Offset Margin-Related Woes: Weyerhaeuser's focus on operational excellence has been advantageous over time. It remains focused on operational excellence that includes merchandising for value, harvest and transportation efficiencies, along with flexing harvest to capture seasonal and short-term opportunities.In 2023, the company delivered solid operational performance and remained determined in its operational excellence initiative to support customers and drive its margins. In 2022, the company captured approximately $40 million of margin improvements across businesses and made meaningful progress against other OpEx priorities.In Timberlands, the achievement was primarily attributed to initiatives for increasing mechanized harvesting in the West, implementing machine planting in the South and optimizing Southern fertilization activity. The business also created significant future value through its efforts to reduce reforestation turnaround time, further enhance seedling survival rates and improve data capture as well as analysis capabilities through expanded use of drones and the LIDAR technology. In Wood Products, the company captured improvements, given a persistent focus on controllable costs, mill reliability and enhanced product mix despite fluctuating operating postures in response to the pandemic."", 'High Costs: In 2023, the company’s adjusted earnings decreased 24.6% year over year. Net sales also declined 24.6% from a year ago. This was mainly due to lower sales volumes in the Western and Southern markets, and lower average sales realizations as cautious sentiment continued to weigh on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook. The company noted that forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.Lumber Market Swings: One of the major cost components of goods sold is the cost of lumber products. The company has no control over the costs of imported lumber products, which are dependent on factors like government policies, environmental regulations, weather conditions, economic conditions and natural disasters.The lumber market is highly volatile, and the market swings have had a negative impact on various operations for WY and other Zacks Building Products - Wood industry players like Boise Cascade Company BCC, JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. JELD and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation LPX.In addition to lumber, the company uses a significant quantity of various resins in the manufacturing processes. Resin product costs are influenced by changes in the prices or availability of raw materials used to produce resins, primarily petroleum products and the demand for and availability of resin products.Low Cash Balance: As of Dec 31, 2023, Weyerhaeuser had cash and cash equivalents of $1.16 billion, down from $1.58 billion at 2022-end. Adjusted FAD — a non-GAAP measure to evaluate the company’s liquidity — was $986 million in 2023, significantly down from $2,327 million in 2022. The company’s long-term debt was $5.07 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023-end, up from $4.07 billion at 2022-end. Weyerhaeuser generated $1,433 million for 2023 versus $2,832 million in the year-ago quarter.', 'Based in Boise, ID, Boise Cascade makes wood products and distributes building materials in the United States as well as Canada. Although BCC acknowledged that the industry faced challenges in 2023, it remains well-positioned for 2024 to execute growth initiatives that started in 2022.Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, JELD-WEN designs, manufactures and sells doors and windows primarily in North America, Europe and Australasia. JELD has taken a two-pronged approach to streamline and strengthen its operations to improve the short-term financial performance as well as position the company well for the long term.Louisiana-Pacific is a leading manufacturer of sustainable, quality-engineered wood building materials, structural framing products and exterior siding for residential, industrial and light commercial construction.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, focus on business transformation & cost-reduction strategy bodes well.However, supply chain woes, inflationary pressure and a high degree of product concentration in the Oriented Strand Board (OSB) segment are risk factors to the company’s growth prospects.', ""Siding Business to Drive Growth: The company has been making efforts to increase penetration of Siding products in repair/remodel and roll out SmartSide products. The company has been witnessing higher-than-expected demand for Smooth SmartSide and ExpertFinish. The company recently announced the expansion of Siding Capacity with the production restart at Peace Valley. The Siding unit contributed 51.5% to sales in 2023. Under the unit, the ExpertFinish product witnessed 8% volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, the same as the prior-year quarter.In 2023, the company undertook strategic moves to enhance the portfolio and market reach of its Siding business. It opened a new ExpertFinish facility in Bath, NY, which shed light on increased automation and improved efficiency in LPX's prefinished siding production. The company remains committed to growing strand Siding revenues in 2024 and beyond. It intends to continue to increase its investment in selling and marketing the said business.Strategic Investments: The company — which shares space with UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI, Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. FND and Weyerhaeuser Company WY in the Zacks Building Products – Wood industry — has been focusing on acquisitions, business combinations and divestitures of low-profitable businesses to drive growth.In May 2023, LPX acquired an idle manufacturing facility in Wawa, Ontario, Canada, from a third party for $80 million. This strategic transaction is expected to make Wawa the largest single-line siding mill of LPX, adding nearly 400 million square feet of capacity. This will bring the total siding capacity to about 2.7 billion square feet. The company also stated that this acquisition will expand its portfolio of future Siding conversions.Focus on Cost-Reduction Strategy: The company is focused on improving business by growing the Siding unit and simultaneously reducing costs. In a bid to reduce costs, Louisiana-Pacific lowered the cost structure of its facilities through Lean Six Sigma efforts, the sale or shutdown of underperforming mills and manufacturing facilities and investments in technology.Adjusted EBITDA of the Siding business increased sequentially to $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $71 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 22%, implying a record in the year 2023. These improvements induced confidence in the company to achieve the long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 25%.In 2023, SG&A expenses declined 2.7% to $257 million on a year-over-year basis, attributable to persistent cost-effective techniques implemented by the company."", 'Higher Costs: Increased marketing investments associated with accelerating repair and remodel channel penetration, along with new product introductions, have been putting pressure on the company’s performance over the last few quarters. In 2023, adjusted earnings per share plunged 72.6% from the year-ago period’s levels. Adjusted EBITDA of $478 million was down by 34.4% from $1.39 billion reported in the prior year, primarily due to lower OSB selling prices, a decrease in OSB sales volumes of $87 million and a reduction in Siding sales volumes of $95 million.Supply-Chain Disruption & Intense Inflation: Louisiana-Pacific and other Wood industry players have been witnessing significant supply chain woes and lingering inflationary pressure, primarily for labor and freight. The company expects labor inflation of about $20 million in 2024.Product Concentrated Around OSB Segment: The company has a high degree of product concentration in OSB, which accounted for about 43%, 57% and 65% of its North American sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, Structural Solutions sales accounted for 55.1% of OSB segment sales compared with 53.8% in the year-ago period. Increased concentration around one segment makes the company susceptible to commodity pricing and price volatility.', ""UFPI: The company has been gaining from accretive acquisitions, investments in product innovation and global footprint expansion, which is strengthening its growth prospects. New product development is an integral part of UFP Industries' strategic plan for its business units. The company's investments in innovation and acceleration are poised to yield greater results in the upcoming periods.FND: The company is benefiting from strong comparable store sales, strategic investments in expanding its operations and accretive acquisitions. In 2024, the company plans to expand its market share by leveraging everyday low prices, value-driven options, trend-right product assortments, ample in-stock quantities and outstanding customer service delivered by store associates.WY: The company is benefiting from an improving new-home market, high demand for carbon/ESG-related projects and a focus on operational excellence. The company is well-poised owing to higher capital inflows for carbon/ESG-related projects. It remains bullish for 2024 and the long term as most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including solid home equity levels and an aging housing stock."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even major US financial institutions faced challenges throughout 2023. In 2024, a\xa0global economic slowdown and macroeconomic weakness fuelled by high interest rates are expected to stir up problems for the banking industry. Although governments worldwide are implementing measures to control inflation, many factors still pose a risk to economic prosperity, including supply chain disruptions, changing trade relationships, geopolitical tensions, and extreme weather events. IMF's latest forecasts indicate global economic growth of only 3% in 2024, with developed economies showing modest growth rates and emerging economies experiencing notable growth.\xa0"", ""According to a Deloitte report, banks globally will face challenges that impact their revenue generation and cost management in 2024. High interest rates have increased net interest income, especially in the United States and Canada, while also driving up funding costs and reducing margins consequently. The global banking industry is now faced with an uphill battle to control deposit costs while customer expectations and market competition skyrocket. Loan growth is forecasted to be modest, given the high borrowing costs and overall macroeconomic dynamics, with banks likely to maintain restrictive credit lending policies. While consumer spending is strong, demand for credit card and auto loans is predicted to remain robust, while demand for corporate loans may temporarily weaken before likely recovering later this year. Additionally, climate change considerations are largely impacting credit availability and loan demand. The blend of higher deposit costs, lower policy rates, and limited loan potential may affect banks' ability to maintain strong net interest margins in 2024. Looking ahead, the global banking landscape is expected to experience further transformation, with Chinese and American banks dominating global rankings and rising influence from Indian banks and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds anticipated over the coming decade."", 'In 2024, Fidelity believes there may be a reason for cautious optimism despite the unsettling closures in 2023, which were driven by specific circumstances not necessarily applicable to all banks and financial institutions. Macroeconomic factors such as growth, inflation, and Federal Reserve policy will likely remain pivotal for the financial sector and the broader market. Recent events at Silicon Valley Bank underscored the importance of deposit quality in the current environment. With interest rates rising, depositors now have higher-yielding options for their excess cash, making deposits more susceptible to potential flight. Hence, focusing on high-quality deposits has become imperative. Institutions like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and M&T Bank illustrate the advantages of such stability.\xa0', 'In 2024, many financial services dealmakers are feeling more optimistic compared to last year, as recent improvements in financial markets and positive signals about interest rates from central banks are slowly restoring investor confidence. Present market conditions, paired with ongoing initiatives like digitalization, sustainability, and addressing workforce challenges, are pushing financial services players to quicken their transformation efforts to remain competitive and profitable. M&A remains a significant part of this transformation journey, especially as organic growth faces challenges in the current macroeconomic environment. Dealmakers are likely to prefer smaller transactions over mega-deals to facilitate transformational steps. Deal processes may also become more complex and protracted. According to PwC, some sectors within the financial services industry are especially attractive for M&A activity in 2024. These include asset and wealth management, insurance, private equity, payments, and fintech. Asset and wealth managers are expected to boost M&A to achieve scale and acquire new capabilities, while insurance companies may divest complex legacy portfolios to reduce costs and enhance capital efficiency. Private equity investors are largely focusing on financial services-related sectors, such as insurance brokerage and fintech, for M&A opportunities.

The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is PG a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for P&G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.45.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for P&G.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 US Cities with the Most Million-Dollar Homes.', 'Since the beginning of the global pandemic, the million-dollar homes in America have doubled. As reported by Redfin, almost 1 in 10 US homes are currently worth at least $1 million. The limited housing inventory during the year also pushed the prices for many homes into the million-dollar category. You can take a look at the US cities with the fewest homes for sale to have a better idea of the inventory shortage.', 'Amidst high mortgage rates in 2023, homeowners continued to hold onto their homes since they had to pay a higher mortgage on a new home. There was intense competition among buyers for the limited for-sale inventory. This shortage made numerous listings valuable, moving properties above the million-dollar mark. High-end homes in decent condition and a fair price were an attraction for many. Some of the most overpriced housing markets in America have been previously covered.', 'The growth of million-dollar homes was the highest in the East Coast metros including Boston, Bridgeport, and Newark. On the other hand, a drop in the million-dollar home share was witnessed in the West Coast metros in 2023. Some of these include Oakland, Oxnard, and Seattle. State-wise, California holds the highest share of homes worth $1 million or more. Californian metros including San Francisco, San Jose, and Anaheim had significant shares of million-dollar homes. Texas and upstate New York had an almost nonexistent inventory of million-dollar homes.', 'The rise in million-dollar home inventory continues to worsen the housing affordability crisis in the United States. While many simply could not afford expensive properties, monthly payments on million-dollar homes increased from 2022 to 2023. As of June 2023, the monthly mortgage payment on a $1 million home was $6,604.', 'However, for the first quarter of 2024, better affordability and easing interest rates have been forecasted to drive the real estate market growth in the United States. The spring season is expected to offer bright prospects by introducing a larger supply of cheaper houses to homebuyers.', 'For the week ending March 14, Realtor reported that the average rate for a 30-year fixed home loan dropped from 6.88% to 6.74%. The annual listing price growth also declined in the week ending March 9, thereby recording the first week of year-over-year price drops since July 2023. Affordable homes within the price bracket of $200,000 and $350,000 have also recorded a rise.', 'Although an uptick in million-dollar homes has been witnessed, many homebuilders continue to address the concerns regarding affordability and availability of housing.

349,cb30fddf-a88c-3b39-9c64-4797554b04a7,AFL,2024-03-26,"Aflac’s CEO gave us that obnoxious, genius duck and changed the insurance industry. Now, he’s facing his aging customers’ mortality—and eventually his own",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-ceo-gave-us-obnoxious-093000637.html,1711445400,STORY,['AFL'],"['Thirty-four years running the same company: It’s not that long, cosmically speaking, and yet today’s world is in some ways unrecognizably different from 1990. The American president then was George Bush (the first one). The Soviet Union was still standing, while China was just emerging as a global superpower. The internet had barely started crawling into U.S. homes, and smartphones were decades away from upending how we all live. It was a world before Facebook, Google, Amazon, or ChatGPT.', '1990 was when Aflac chairman and CEO Dan Amos started running the oddball life insurer founded by his father and two uncles. When Amos took over, his family’s company was not yet “AFLAAAAC!” The TV-commercial squawking of Aflac’s duck mascot, which Amos unleashed in 2000, would go on to create a pop-culture phenomenon—one that helped change how all insurance is sold.', 'Over those 34 years, Amos grew his family’s company into a Fortune\xa0500 fixture, with $18.7\xa0billion in revenue last year. Its annual sales have increased sevenfold over his tenure. Its shares were trading at around $85 in late March, far beyond their (split-adjusted) 1990 value of $1.\xa0In Japan, where Aflac does the majority of its business, the company is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary. And in the United States, where Aflac in 2008 became the first publicly-traded company to give shareholders an annual “say on pay” vote, Amos has helped shape the corporate landscape of today.', '“I’ve experienced it all,” Amos told me recently, sitting in Aflac’s blocky tower in Columbus, Ga., which his predecessors built in 1975. At age 72, he is now the fifth-longest-serving CEO of any Fortune\xa0500 company. (Berkshire Hathaway’s 93-year-old Warren Buffett holds the longest tenure.)', 'It’s a tremendous and rare accomplishment, especially given that the average Fortune\xa0500 CEO lasts seven years. At several years past the traditional (and, at some companies, mandated) U.S. retirement age of 65, Amos has outlasted many of his contemporaries and seen multiple would-be successors, including his son, retire or resign. And by now he’s used to global upheaval: “He’s been able to navigate a pandemic, a changing rate environment, and a changing product portfolio admirably well,” says John Barnidge, a Piper Sandler analyst who covers Aflac and other insurers.', 'But despite the vampire fantasies of biohacking Silicon Valley billionaires, no CEO lives—or works—forever. Amos is closer to the end of his tenure than its beginning—even if, like Buffett, he clearly relishes what he does and plans to keep on doing it as long as he physically can. “There’s only so many fish I can catch,” Amos says. “I’m not going to be that good of a retiree.”', 'His company is also aging and showing the limits of its long-ago innovations. Aflac’s annual sales have been shrinking since 2019 and have shed more than $6\xa0billion from their 2012 high of $25.4\xa0billion. In Japan, where Aflac makes 70% of its profits, its core customers are aging—and dying out—at an alarming rate. And in the United States, where Aflac mostly sells nice-to-have but not strictly necessary “supplemental” insurance, it’s facing regulatory scrutiny, changing customer attitudes, and the basic challenge of selling expensive extras to inflation-squeezed consumers.', 'All that, plus a CEO whose long tenure inevitably raises questions about how he’s preparing the company to thrive after him. “Longevity brings stability,” says Cathy Seifert, an insurance-industry analyst for CFRA Research. ""But are you marking time? Or are you staying relevant and dynamic?”', 'As a company, Aflac has always been—forgive me—an odd duck. It’s based in deep Georgia, on the border of Alabama—yet most of its sales happen across the globe, in Japan. It’s a family-run business that has had two CEOs in its 69-year history—Dan and his uncle John—but no longer has an Amos heir waiting in the wings. And despite its mascot’s larger-than-life presence, Aflac sells very little insurance directly to American consumers.', 'What Aflac mostly sells in the United States is supplemental insurance—disability or accident or dental or vision insurance that your employer might offer while you enroll in your annual benefits. As a result, Aflac relies mostly on third parties—employers and contractor insurance brokers—to sell its products in the United States.', '2', 'Number of CEOs Aflac has had in its 69-year history', 'One major challenge for Aflac’s core U.S. business growth is the increased cost of living. Americans who buy cars or homes are usually required to insure them—but amid recent crushing inflation, the supplemental nature of Aflac’s insurance products makes them a relative luxury for cash-strapped potential customers.', 'Inflation is “always a concern,” Amos acknowledges. But Aflac’s U.S. sales did tick up 5% last year, and he points out that it could be much worse. “I was around in the Carter years,” he says, invoking the record “stagflation” of the late 1970s. “This is no inflation compared to then.”', 'His office was around then, too. The whole vibe is very old-fashioned men’s club: dark wood, carpets, oil paintings of his two (now adult) children on the wall, a bronzed wooden bookend—in the shape of a duck, of course—on his desk. Amos himself, a courteous Southern grandfather who relishes the chance to tell a story, has wings of blondish hair, round tortoiseshell glasses, and the executive fashion sense of a pre-Zuckerberg era: suit, loafers, pocket square. His tie (like all his ties, according to a colleague) is printed with ducks—and it’s nearly impossible to step off an elevator in the complex without being confronted by larger-than-life posters or artwork or stuffed versions of the waterfowl. They’re even on the blue Aflac sign atop the tower, still the tallest building in Columbus.', 'But if Aflac’s home base at first appears dedicated to the duck, it’s fundamentally an older—and stranger—shrine to its founding family. Outside, the multilevel parking garage is capped by the now-decaying house that John Amos, the current CEO’s uncle and predecessor, built on top of it. Paintings of past and current Amos men, in evolving eras’ suit styles, flank important entrances.\xa0Upstairs from Dan’s desk, his late father’s office is preserved, as if for a museum, next to the boardroom named for him—“Chairman Paul S. Amos,” or, as longtime employees refer to him, “Mr. Paul.”', 'The company was founded in 1955 by Paul Amos and his brothers John and Bill, who moved up from the Florida panhandle for the specific purpose of setting up an insurer. At the time, Columbus was the largest Southeastern city without an established insurance competitor—as Fortune chronicled in a 2004 feature framed on Amos’s wall. (Originally the American Family Life Insurance Co., the name eventually swapped “Assurance” for “Insurance,” then evolved into the acronym Aflac.)', 'Today, Dan Amos—who owns 0.5% of the company’s shares and 1.3% of voting shares—has turned his family business into a powerhouse, with more than 12,700 full-time employees globally. But its sales model, in particular its reliance on independent contractors, has sometimes gotten Aflac into reputational and legal hot water. Six years ago, the company faced a series of lawsuits alleging that Aflac used deceptive recruiting tactics, pressured employees to sell products without customer authorization, and misclassified employees as independent contractors. Aflac denied the claims in these lawsuits, which have since been dismissed or sent to arbitration, and today Amos glosses over the legal troubles: “We’ve had some things that have come up, but in all the cases, we’ve ended up coming out very strong.”', 'He is similarly dismissive of pending federal regulatory changes that would require some of Aflac’s U.S. customers to pay taxes on benefits they receive. But Aflac faces arguably an even bigger problem: In a world where you can buy almost anything with a few clicks, the company relies on what Seifert calls an “antiquated distribution system” throughout the highly regulated (and technologically creaky) life insurance industry.', '“Consumer preferences have shifted to doing everything online,” she says. “That’s the challenge that I don’t think a whole lot of life insurance companies, Aflac included, have successfully met.”', 'Personally, Amos certainly isn’t anti-tech: The invention of the smartphone “changed my life,” he told me, by allowing him to prolong his CEO tenure without missing out on family obligations. Now he can accompany his wife to the Atlanta antique shows she loves, or work from his Massachusetts vacation home during the first month of a pandemic, while remaining connected to his company.', 'But he’s skeptical about using smartphone apps or other low-touch, high-tech, millennial- and Gen\xa0Z–friendly platforms to sell Aflac’s U.S. products. “Our insurance is sold, not bought,” Amos says, explaining that supplemental insurance’s discretionary nature means “you have to sit down and explain to [customers] why they need it.”', 'When I told a Japanese friend that I was traveling to Georgia to interview Aflac’s CEO, she was puzzled: “That’s a Japanese company, isn’t it? The one with the duck?”', 'And indeed, from its good ol’ Southern base, the Amos brothers’ company has become, somehow, big in Japan. In 1970, the story goes, John traveled to Osaka for the world’s fair and noticed that people frequently wore medical masks in public. It was half a century before a global pandemic would turn masking into a widespread health practice outside Asia, and John Amos saw an opportunity: Any culture that was so public health conscious would likely rush to buy more insurance, he reasoned. And he had already invented just the right product.', 'In 1957, after the three men’s father died of cancer, John Amos saw a business opportunity in his family’s loss: What if Aflac could sell “cancer insurance”? Customers who were diagnosed received payments to cover the costs their health insurance generally didn’t: hiring home health aides, traveling for treatment, paying for hotel rooms when relatives came to visit.', 'In the U.S., Aflac fueled its early growth by selling these policies through smaller employers—but in Japan, where cancer rates had started rising dramatically in the 1950s as people’s average life span increased, Amos struck gold. Cancer was particularly stigmatized at that time in Japan, where doctors often wouldn’t even tell dying patients what was killing them. None of Aflac’s local competitors wanted to touch the disease, or the business of selling insurance against it—leaving the American interloper a lucrative window, and a chance to win over Japanese regulators.', '70%', 'Percentage of Aflac’s profits that come from its insurance business in Japan', 'Today, after half a century in the country, Aflac holds more than 58% of existing cancer insurance policies there, according to Moody’s.\xa0Crucially, in a country that remains famously resistant to immigration or foreign influence, Aflac’s half-century of history has built a reservoir of trust and brand recognition. Dan Amos doesn’t speak the language, beyond “a few words,” but his company, which has hired Japanese executives to run its local operations since the 1970s, seems entrenched in the country’s business and culture. In 2023, about 60 percent of Aflac’s revenue and 70 percent of its profits came from Japan.', 'But now that dominance has become a mixed blessing. Japan’s economy is mired in a years-long malaise and the yen has been weak. And the far more existential threat—for Aflac and for the very future of Japan—is that its customers are aging and, slowly, dying out. More than 10% of Japan’s population is 80 or older; in late February, the country said the number of babies born in 2023 had fallen for an eighth straight year, to a new record low. Its population is on track to shrink 30% by 2070.', 'Japan’s declining population is “definitely a challenge,” says Seifert, “and a risk.” It also previews a slower-moving problem for the United States: In November, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that the country’s population would start shrinking by the end of the century (adding that, without the effects of immigration, that decline would have already started this year).', 'Aflac’s cancer focus provides some bleak upside to these demographic trends, as rates of the disease are skyrocketing. “Cancer is a disease of the aging,” Piper Sandler’s Barnidge points out. As people get older, more fall prey to the disease, and it stands to reason that more will jump at a chance to buy insurance against some of the costs associated with it.', 'Of course, aging customers are also more likely to get sick and to need a payout. For Aflac, or any life insurer, growth depends on selling premiums to healthier customers who are going to pay for protection they are statistically less likely to need. And Aflac is taking some steps to do that: In September, it started targeting younger, healthier Japanese consumers with a revamped supplemental insurance product, “with the idea that we’ll go back and tack on additional coverage later on, as they get older,” Amos says.', 'And then, he adds, there’s always his not-so-secret weapon: “The Aflac duck is very popular over there—and that helps us sell to younger people.”', 'A couple of days after I met with Amos, an episode of Jeopardy! aired with this clue: “Thanks to a duck saying its name, this company said its brand recognition jumped from 11% to 94% in 14 years.” The correct response, of course: “What is Aflac?”', 'The company’s obnoxious mascot is the professional pride and joy of Dan Amos, who has said that he “bet my entire life on a damn duck.” It was late 1999—almost a decade after he had become CEO, after his uncle John died of lung cancer—and Aflac needed a boost. Its advertising agency presented Amos with two different potential TV commercials: One involved a traditional, sober testimonial from the sitcom star Ray Romano. The other featured a duck squawking out the ungainly acronym that gave Aflac its name.', 'Amos picked the duck—in a decision that influenced his entire industry and how its products are still sold today. This was at the dawn of “that weird, quirky insurance advertising model that has now permeated everything,” Seifert recalls. Aflac’s braying duck and Geico’s talking gecko (introduced a few months earlier) paved the way for Liberty Mutual’s LiMu Emu, Allstate’s Mayhem, Jake from State Farm, and—as the New York Times recently highlighted in a magazine profile of actor Stephanie Courtney—the 16-year reign of Flo from Progressive.', 'Aflac’s sales doubled within the first three years of the mascot’s debut. “We took the chance—and it was well worth it,” Amos says.', 'The duck occasionally ruffled some customer feathers—especially in Japan, where Amos eventually launched a “softer” spokesfowl. The U.S. duck had long been voiced by Gilbert Gottfried; but after Japan’s 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed 20,000 people, the comedian made a series of bad jokes on Twitter about the disaster. Aflac quickly fired Gottfried (who died in 2022). The duck, since voiced by less famous humans, was safe.', 'Still, the success of Aflac’s TV commercials can unintentionally highlight the limited portfolio of what Aflac actually sells. People will sometimes contact Aflac agents seeking property or casualty insurance or other products the company doesn’t offer, Amos volunteers. But he wants to be “methodical” about any future expansion. “What has helped me the most in my career is staying focused,” he says. “Everybody’s got an idea to get you off track.”', 'Despite all of the wacky waterfowl, cancer remains the grim center of Aflac’s business—and of the Amos family’s history.', 'The disease killed Amos’s grandfather, and then his uncle John, and then—last summer, at age 48—his son-in-law. “It was terrible,” Amos says. “I’ve seen it everywhere.” (In 1995 he set up a foundation to raise money for treating childhood cancer.)', 'So Aflac’s CEO is deeply familiar with death by now. He’s spent 34 years making himself and his family and his investors wealthy by selling his customers some peace of mind about their eventual endings. And he knows that in order for his company to succeed for decades beyond him, it has to reckon with its customers’ aging and encroaching mortality—as well as his own.', 'That conversation has taken on national resonance these days: As President Joseph Biden, 81, faces off again against former President Donald Trump, 77, the headlines have been dominated by pearl-clutching over the mental fitness of aging leaders.', 'Days before I interviewed Amos in February, a special counsel report calling Biden an “elderly man with a poor memory” set off a breathless news cycle about the president’s fitness to stand for reelection. Amos is almost a decade younger, but was clearly exasperated by the political chatter: When I asked about his own succession plans, he brought up Biden.', '“The more you communicate publicly, the less you’ll be effective as the CEO,” he says. “They’re circling Biden now, for that same purpose—and if he gives a hint, it’s a feeding frenzy.”', 'Amos started at Aflac as a salesman at age 23, and he wants it known that he earned his chops; he’s not just a nepo baby. “I chose to go into sales, because it was objective,” he tells me. “If you made your numbers, as a general rule, you did well—and CEO is the same way.”', ""Amos says he still wants to be judged on his performance—which has been pretty good, notwithstanding the recent revenue declines. Aflac’s annualized shareholder returns over his tenure have been more than 15%, versus more than 10% for the S&P\xa0500 index over the same period. And whenever he does step down, Aflac's investors will likely feel some short-term pain: On average, companies’ financial performance tends to drop 29 percent from the mean after a CEO retires, according to a working paper co-authored by Mo Wang, a professor at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business."", 'Wang points out that, as the global tech and business landscape becomes ever-more complicated, companies with older leaders often benefit: “You want someone with a lot of experience, because they’ve seen a lot of low-probability things,” he says, adding that “these days, 72 is not that old.”', 'Amos acknowledges, “The older we get, we have to be monitored closer.” But he remains healthy, and reiterates what he has told investors several times over the past decade: “I see myself staying around for several more years.”', 'When Amos does eventually retire, it’s far from clear who will step into his shoes. He calls succession planning “my number one responsibility,” but says that the only people who need to know the details are his board members. “I think it’s very important that you lay out a plan,” he explains. “But you never set a date” or talk about the plan publicly, he says, adding—in a reflexive, perhaps-unconscious pun—that he wants to avoid becoming “a lame duck.”', 'Until 2017, it was widely assumed that Amos planned to eventually cede Aflac’s CEO job to his son, and the company’s then-president, Paul Amos II. But then, in a plot twist straight from the TV show Succession, the younger Amos left the company to join a private equity firm. “Entrepreneurship runs in my genes and … I want to be part of an enterprise I can help scale up and build out,” Paul told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer at the time, before adding that he didn’t expect his then-65-year-old dad to step back anytime soon: “Dan Amos retiring in five years would shock me.”', '“Paul wanted to do his own thing,” his father says today. (Paul Amos did not respond to requests for comment.)\xa0And since his son left Aflac, Dan Amos hasn’t spoken publicly about who might succeed him. President and chief operating officer Fred Crawford, who in 2017 was seen as the most likely next Aflac CEO, in November announced his retirement at age 60. “I would go crazy if I had to quit that young,” Amos says, “but that’s what he wanted to do.”', ""Analysts are split on whether Amos’s public silence is the best way to approach succession planning or to set his eventual replacement up for success. “I don't get the sense that there is a front-and-center showcase of next-gen talent the way that there may be at some other companies,” Seifert says. “No one says you have to give us granular details—but I think perhaps more could be done to reassure people of a long-term plan.”"", 'Even Warren Buffett, after all, eventually started publicly acknowledging that one of his Berkshire deputies, Greg Abel, will someday replace him. In his most recent annual letter to shareholders, published in February, Buffett wrote that Abel “in all respects is ready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow.”', ""But Amos's board, at least, seems fully behind his approach. “We have an emergency succession plan, should anything happen to our officers, and we spend plenty of time on how our executives are developing,” says Dr. Katherine Rohrer, Princeton’s former vice provost, who joined Aflac’s board in 2017 and oversees its succession planning as head of its corporate governance committee. But, she adds, “I hope Dan remains the CEO as long as possible!”"", 'Whenever and however it occurs, Aflac’s leadership change will signal more than just a career transition. For Amos, passing off his company to someone outside of the family represents an inevitable but wrenching loss. ', '“I believe I’m a better CEO because of the family connection,” Amos says. “It feels like one of my children.”', 'It’s a bittersweet reality for Amos, whose career and family legacy have persuaded tens of millions of his customers to prepare for the worst of what fate can throw at us. But, he acknowledges, there are some endings that all the insurance in the world can’t prevent.', '“It’s just part of life,” he says. “I know that it wasn’t going to stay that way forever.”', 'The average tenure of a Fortune\xa0500 CEO is seven years, but the four longest-serving company leaders have lasted decades. (It helps to have founded your company.)', 'Warren E.\xa0Buffett, 93, has led the multinational holding company Berkshire Hathaway (No.\xa07 on the 2023 Fortune\xa0500) for 54 years.', 'Albert H.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ', 'As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$10.8b in cash, so it actually has US$8.86b net cash.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.42b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.68b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$10.8b as well as receivables valued at US$5.67b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$9.41b more liquid assets than total liabilities.', 'This short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Simply put, the fact that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.', 'But the bad news is that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has seen its EBIT plunge 15% in the last twelve months. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Regeneron Pharmaceuticals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.', 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals recorded free cash flow worth 75% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""While it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has US$8.86b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$3.7b, being 75% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's use of debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

But companies seeking them must back them up with bigger studies that prove those benefits by testing their therapies against a placebo or existing treatment.', 'Regeneron has already begun such a trial.\xa0However, the agency doesn’t believe Regeneron has made enough progress with enrollment yet, prompting a rejection. The FDA must also sign off on the timelines for the study’s completion before Regeneron resubmits its application.

Still, the setback represents a missed opportunity for Regeneron, which has struggled to compete with more established players in oncology.', '“We continue to see odronextamab as a modest opportunity given competitive headwinds, with the delay as a further hurdle to garnering market share,” he wrote. “The [rejection] also further adds to investor pessimism on the company’s execution within oncology.”', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

With this level of prediction, the investigators determined the test could help reduce PET brain scan evaluations by about 40%, with potentially substantial savings in healthcare costs for these patients.', 'While amyloid PET imaging is an established method for aiding diagnosis of AD, it is significantly more expensive, invasive and specialist-dependent than blood tests.', '""The findings of this analysis in a large cohort have significant implications for AD care management, because they potentially mean many patients could benefit from this type of blood-based assay that has advantages relative to current approaches,"" said co-author David E.

The investigators then applied the NPV of 99% to the population of 6,192 deidentified specimens tested by Quest for Aβ42/40.
