Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, The Boeing Co. BA, Sony Group Corp. SONY, The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) and Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS).', ""The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. , The Boeing Co. and Sony Group Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>NVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+19.3% vs. +16.9%). The company’s computer & networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+4% vs. -6.8%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier joint venture might cause it to incur some loss in the future. Rising jet fuel price also poses a threat to the stock’s future growth.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here >>>)Sony’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Audio Video Production industry over the past year (+13.7% vs. +12.7%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in the Games & Network (G&NS) segment. The company continues to expect to sell more than 25 million units of its PlayStation 5 in the current year.SONY sold 4.9 million units of PS5 in Q2, up 25% year over year. Strength in Music, and Pictures segments are other tailwinds. The Music segment benefits from higher recorded music and music publishing sales from paid subscription streaming services. Frequent product launches and strategic collaborations bode well.The company also raised overall guidance for fiscal 2023 revenues It now expects sales of ¥12,400 billion compared with the earlier guidance of ¥12,200 billion. However, SONY lowered guidance for Pictures and Financial Services segments. Stiff competition and weak global macroeconomic conditions are concerning.(You can read the full research report on Sony here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Charles Schwab Corp. and Synopsys, Inc."", ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

But AI boils down to more than just owning any stock that happens to have some connection to those two magic letters. Inevitably, hype attracts both contenders and pretenders. Some AI stocks will be winners, and some won't."", ""Want to know which AI stocks to consider in 2024? I've made you a cheat sheet to point you in the right direction."", 'Here are the five AI stocks you need to have on your radar:', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW)', 'Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR)', 'ASML (NASDAQ: ASML)', ""Here's why these five AI stocks are worth watching in 2024."", ""The company's stock exploded by 230% over the past year, but the hype is warranted. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the go-to hardware for AI applications. Their cutting-edge technology and the fact that they're good for demanding computing applications helped propel Nvidia to an estimated 80% to 95% market share for AI chips. You can see how companywide revenue nearly doubled to $45 billion in 2023:"", ""Considering AI is still a nascent industry and given that Nvidia sits in the driver's seat, the company is poised for tremendous long-term earnings growth. Competitors will surely come for Nvidia's market share, but their success is no guarantee. Until proven otherwise, Nvidia remains the chip king in the AI industry."", ""For a technology giant like Microsoft, AI might seem like an afterthought. After all, Microsoft dabbles in virtually everything, including cloud computing, gaming, enterprise software, and personal electronics. However, don't be fooled: AI is a priority for Microsoft. Investors will want to own Microsoft stock for its hefty investments and tight partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT."", ""OpenAI is one of the world's fastest-growing companies. Microsoft's multibillion-dollar tie-up gives it the pole position for enjoying that growth and using it to benefit its other business segments. For example, Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, powers all OpenAI computing loads. It's not an obvious AI stock, but don't overlook its long-term AI opportunities."", 'Data might be the most essential ingredient of AI technology outside of computing power. However, data often comes from multiple sources and can be disorganized and hard to use. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse platform that securely stores, analyzes, and shares data. That makes it a potentially crucial role player for companies using AI.', ""Snowflake's rapid growth backs that up. The company's revenue has multiplied over the past several years, and analysts believe profits could compound at over 60% annually on average. Snowflake's data marketplace could someday be the go-to channel where companies access the data needed for their AI models."", ""AI has become critical to the world's political powers. Palantir answers that bell. It has built and sold custom software to the U.S. government for years. Government business is over half of Palantir's revenue. The company is rapidly expanding its commercial business, too."", ""Most importantly, Palantir last year released AIP, a platform for implementing AI models. Management has noted that more than 300 organizations have tried AIP in the first five months since its launch. How big could AIP be in a few years? Palantir's tremendous expansion opportunities could mean that top- and bottom-line growth continues well into the future."", ""Many people don't realize that companies like Nvidia don't build the high-tech chips they sell. Factories, called fabs, make them. In those factories are cutting-edge machines that ASML creates. It's fair to say ASML has a monopoly. It virtually owns an estimated 90% market share for extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to make advanced semiconductor chips."", ""If advancing AI models need top-notch chips to power them, manufacturers will need more of ASML's machines to make them. That's already shown up in ASML's revenue growth, which hit a spurt in 2023. Analysts expect a healthy 22% average annual earnings growth, so investors should buckle up. Investors should continue looking at ASML stock for as long as its machines build those high-tech chips powering AI."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia delivered record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 surged 1,274%. Tepid results from the prior year skewed the comparison, but it helps illustrate the long runway ahead.', ""Nvidia has a long history of impressive growth, but excitement regarding its AI-fueled results drove the stock up 239% in 2023. Its performance is even more pronounced when considered over the past 10 years. Revenue has soared 1,480%, driving net income up 6,190%. This growth has fueled Nvidia's surging stock price, which is up more than 13,650%, with a price of $531 as of Tuesday's market close. Despite its performance, Nvidia still trades for a reasonable price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the benchmark for an inexpensive stock."", ""The company's most recent stock split was announced in May 2021 when the stock was trading at about $600 per share, just 13% above its current price. If things continue along the current trajectory -- and history is any indication -- it won't be long before Nvidia announces its next stock split."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is best known for its Office suite of productivity tools and ubiquitous Windows PC operating system. Last year, however, the company made a big splash in the field of generative AI. After taking a big stake in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, Microsoft released Copilot, a suite of AI-infused assistants designed to streamline mundane, time-consuming tasks. These moves kicked off the current AI arms race.', 'Strong demand for Microsoft\'s AI tools helped kick-start growth for Azure Cloud, its ""Big Three"" cloud infrastructure service. Not only did growth outpace its rivals in the calendar third quarter, but Microsoft also attributed three percentage points of that growth directly to demand for AI.', ""For its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), Microsoft's revenue grew 13% year over year, while EPS climbed 27%. However, Copilot wasn't made available for general release until November, which means the impact hasn't yet hit the financial statements."", ""Microsoft has a long, distinguished track record of enviable growth, but the company's prescient AI moves helped drive the stock price up 57% in 2023. The results are even more compelling if we take a step back. Over the past decade, revenue has grown 177%, driving net income up 294%. This has pushed Microsoft's stock price higher, up nearly 817%, with a price of about $376 as of Tuesday's market close. The stock is selling for 33 times forward earnings but, considering its history, deserves a slight premium."", ""The company conducted nine stock splits between 1987 and 2003, rarely letting its stock price exceed $175. While Microsoft hasn't split its shares since 2003, the stock is now trading at a new all-time high of more than twice that price. And the company has only just scratched the surface of its AI opportunity, which suggests more stock price gains are ahead."", ""Microsoft hasn't indicated any plans for a stock split, but given its robust growth, this may be the year it joins its tech peers in splitting its high-priced shares."", ""2023 was a banner year for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), with a number of catalysts helping lift the stock. The company's cost-cutting campaign showed dramatic results, digital advertising began to recover from its historic drought, and AI went viral. Each of these factors helped Meta regain its footing, which sent its stock up 194%."", ""Meta's long history with AI helped the company pivot to capitalize on that expertise. Meta quickly developed Llama AI, which was released on all the major cloud services -- for a fee. Llama AI 2 was introduced late last year, and rumors suggest Llama 3 will debut in early 2024."", ""In the third quarter, Meta's revenue of $34.1 billion climbed 23% year over year, while its EPS of $4.39 surged 168% -- even as digital ad spending grew just 7.8% last year. As ad spending ramps back up, Meta's growth will get a boost."", 'Then there\'s Advantage+, AI tools designed to empower advertisers on Meta\'s social media platforms. It has quickly become ""one of the fastest-growing ad products"" in Meta\'s history. A recent trial generated a 35% increase in return on ad spending and a 58% decrease in incremental costs per purchase. By streamlining and automating ad campaigns, Meta is simplifying the process, making it more profitable, and attracting more advertisers.', ""Meta's growth last year was notable, but the past decade has been even more impressive. Revenue has grown by 1,260%, while net income surged 1,700%. This has fueled Meta's robust stock price gains of 493%, with the stock price of roughly $357 as of Tuesday's market close -- within 6% of a new all-time high.

The new enterprise package comes with significant improvements that Bracelin thinks easily validate its $39 per month cost (surpassing the individual pricing of GitHub Copilot at $10 per month and the business version at $19 per month). As of November 2023, the user base for GitHub Copilot has rapidly grown to over 1 million paid developers, and according to the latest data, in a show of strength, December traffic to www.github.com has accelerated on a year-over-year basis for the third month in a row.', 'On the other hand, Bracelin notes that commentary around M365 Copilot was “surprisingly light,” reinforcing his take that it is still in the early enterprise adoption phase and could take a while to scale.', 'In fact, considering the big shares price gains of the past year (57% in 2023), while MSFT now sits at the summit of the world’s most valuable companies, and remains Bracelin’s “favorite AI All-Star stock,” the analyst believes it might need “further AI proof-points and/or time to grow into the premium multiple over the next 3-6 months.” “Regardless,” Bracelin summed up, “MSFT has a first-mover advantage in AI that makes this a core growth holding.”', 'As such, Bracelin reiterated an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating and $455 price target, implying shares will push 17% higher over the one-year timeframe.

Barring one skeptic, all of Bracelin’s colleagues to have recently chimed in with MSFT reviews – 35, in total – are also bulls, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy.

Their hope is that as it rapidly expands the number of coffee shops it operates, its sales will climb, and shareholders will achieve massive gains."", ""But if you're looking to add Dutch Bros to your portfolio, it might be best to forget about it. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is a magnificent coffee stock to consider instead."", ""Dutch Bros currently has 831 stores nationwide. Management plans to have 4,000 locations open in 10 to 15 years. This targeted fivefold expansion is what draws investors to the stock. However, it means the company isn't necessarily sound from a financial perspective."", 'Dutch Bros needed to raise $300 million of external equity capital in September to fund its growth efforts. And it might need to raise more again in the future. Therefore, its success and survival are likely to be dependent on capital market conditions, which are completely outside of its control. This adds risk to the equation.', ""It's not a surprise that Dutch Bros' net income of $13.4 million in the third quarter translated to a weak margin of 5%. And while it's opening new locations at a fast clip, same-shop sales only increased by 4% last quarter. That was about half the rate of growth that Starbucks achieved."", ""At its current scale, with third-quarter revenue of $264 million, I'd argue that Dutch Bros doesn't have a competitive moat. It lacks the brand recognition to be considered a household name. Making matters worse, the coffee industry is incredibly competitive, making things more difficult for its leadership team."", 'Because Dutch Bros is a younger, more nimble, company with a potentially larger growth runway than an established giant like Starbucks, investors might feel compelled to scoop up its shares. But that would be a mistake.', 'Starbucks, with its long and successful operating history, is the obvious better coffee stock to buy and hold. There are numerous reasons why this is the case.', 'For starters, Starbucks does possess a moat. Its brand is a powerful intangible asset that is recognized across the globe. Not only does this help protect the business from competitive threats, but it lets Starbucks charge premium prices for its food and beverage items, which are essentially just commoditized products. ', 'It is also consistently profitable, and has already proved that its business model can work in a sustainable way. In its fiscal 2023 (which ended Oct. 1), Starbucks posted an operating margin of 16.3%, better than Dutch Bros.', 'Even better, Starbucks generates copious amounts of free cash flow. This allowed management to pay out $2.4 billion in dividends and buy back $1 billion worth of outstanding shares in its most recent fiscal year. It could be decades until Dutch Bros can implement a favorable capital return strategy like this.', 'Given that Starbucks already has 38,038 stores across the globe, critical investors might assume that Starbucks has little room left for growth. Its leadership team disagrees. The company has set a goal to have 55,000 locations open by 2030 -- a much bigger footprint that would produce considerably more sales and earnings. While most of that expansion is planned for international markets, particularly China, it will also keep adding new coffee shops in the U.S., which will surely make things difficult for Dutch Bros.', 'As of this writing, Starbucks shares are trading 26% below the all-time high they touched in July 2021. Furthermore, they trade at an attractive valuation: The current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6 is about as cheap as the stock has sold for in the last three years, presenting investors with a good opportunity to add a winning business to their portfolios.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Starbucks wasn't one of them.

""We said: as long as we can get at least about $100 million of business in the next few years, we can definitely invest in it.""', 'Fast forward to today and Aequs makes dozens of types of toys for Hasbro and others including Spin Master in two 350,000-square-foot facilities in Belgaum, India.', ""But Hegde and other manufacturers acknowledge that India and other countries cannot match China for efficiency, limiting companies' efforts to shift to lower cost bases and raising the risk of higher toy prices in future if the bulk of production remains in China."", '""We don\'t have the port facilities (in India) that China does. We don\'t have the road facilities that China does. They have been doing this for the last 30 years, their efficiency levels are much better than ours,"" Hedge said.', 'Still, for toy manufacturers including Hasbro and Barbie doll maker Mattel, the risks of relying on China for most of their production were highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Chinese ports struggled to export goods and were periodically shut down, leaving shipments stranded.', 'Soaring labour costs in China had already been driving manufacturers across industries to diversify production geographically.', 'A report by Rhodium Group last September showed that total announced U.S. and European greenfield investment into India shot up by $65 billion or 400% between 2021 and 2022, while investment into China dropped to less than $20 billion in 2022, from a peak of $120 billion in 2018. Mexico, Vietnam and Malaysia also drew some of this redirected capital.', 'Yet toymakers are struggling to shift production even as other industries succeed.', ""As of the first seven months of last year, mainland China still made 79% of toys sold in the United States and Europe, versus 82% in 2019, according to U.S. and European Union import data provided to Reuters by S&P Global Market Intelligence's trade data service Panjiva."", 'In comparison, mainland China in 2019 accounted for 35% of U.S. and EU apparel imports. This reduced to just 30% in the year to July 31, with India and Mexico the biggest beneficiaries.', '""Is it easy to re-shore away from mainland China? No, it isn\'t. That goes double for toys,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence\'s Chris Rogers said. ""It\'s more complicated because they\'re highly seasonal -- you\'re asking a partner to sit on inventory for most of the year. Toy makers also have to be doubly rigorous on safety, sourcing and making sure workers are treated well.""', ""While China's minimum wage varies from between 1,420 yuan per month to 2,690 yuan per month ($198.52-$376.08), in India unskilled and semi-skilled workers can be secured for between 9,000 Indian rupees and 15,000 Indian rupees a month ($108.04- $180.06), according to central bank estimates."", 'But setting up to source from other countries can take 18 months if a company is buying product from a contract manufacturer, and up to three years if a firm is building a new factory from scratch, Rogers said.', 'Toys to be sold in the autumn go into production starting in May and are then stored or shipped.', ""'MORE REASONABLE COST'"", 'Hasbro began addressing its outsized dependence on China as an operational risk in its annual report in 2018, while Mattel has reportedly been shifting away from China since 2007, when it had to recall millions of toys tainted with lead paint. Efforts across the industry have ramped up since the pandemic.', 'Hasbro did not respond to a request for comment, while Mattel declined to comment for this story.', ""Spiralling Chinese wages are helping push up toy prices. In the UK, for instance, prices rose by about 8% in the first six months of 2022, according to Circana, formerly known as NPD. The risk for consumers is that prices will keep on rising sharply if manufacturers can't cut costs by moving to cheaper production centres."", 'Though U.S. duties on Chinese toys are currently negligible, that could also change as some Republican politicians have called for revoking China\'s ""permanent normal trade relations"" status. Such a move could raise the price of toys in the United States by more than a fifth, according to the National Retail Federation.', '""We are all looking at derisking China,"" said Nic Aldridge, managing director at Bandai UK, the maker of Tamagotchi virtual pets. ""Raw materials costs have gone up a lot in China, we\'re looking for places where we could get a more reasonable cost.""', 'Bandai still mostly manufactures in mainland China but some of its products are made in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam.

The episode then dives into three highly-ranked stocks with strong positions in various industries that investors might want to buy now with their earnings results around the corner.', 'The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished Thursday trading flat, making up ground following earlier losses. Despite slightly hotter-than-projected headline inflation data, Wall Street took comfort in the fact that Core monthly CPI matched projections and Core YoY came in slightly lower than the prior month.', 'Wall Street is looking beyond any lingering inflation worries to earnings season. The S&P 500 traded just below its all-time highs as JPMorgan and others kick off the busy stretch of Q4 earnings.', 'Investors appear ready to send the benchmark to new highs in short order. With this in mind, let’s explore three highly-ranked Zacks stocks that are reporting in the coming weeks that investors might want to consider buying for long-term upside.', 'Fastenal – Q4 Earnings on January 18', 'Fastenal is a wholesale distributor of industrial supplies, construction tools, safety products, and beyond, ranging from fasteners and electrical supplies to hardware, building supplies, and much more. FAST offers various distribution and delivery methods, including industrial-style vending machines and other rather unique offerings from roughly 3,400 in-market locations that include local hubs, customer-specific onsite areas, and more.', 'Fastenal is less vulnerable to the boom-and-bust cycles of the broader industrial and construction segments because it doesn’t sell big-ticket items. Fastenal’s smaller components are key cogs to countless companies and industries at all times. FAST has grown its sales every year since the financial crisis, including 16% sales expansion last year.', 'Fastenal is projected to post 5% revenue growth in 2023 and 6% higher sales next year to boost its adjusted earnings by 6% both periods. FAST’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The company also boasts an impressive balance sheet that has allowed it to boost its dividend by significant margins recently.', 'Fastenal stock has soared 950% in the past 20 years vs. its industry’s 687%, and the S&P 500’s 330%. FAST has climbed by 28% in the last 12 months and it recently found support at its 50-day moving average following a pullback.

LRN crushed our estimates last quarter and provided upbeat guidance, as it benefits from strength in its career learning segment, especially from its middle and high school cohort."", 'Zacks estimates call for LRN’s revenue to climb another 9% this year and over 6% higher next year, while its adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 35% and 13%, respectively. And its upbeat earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).', 'Stride shares have climbed 155% in the last three years to crush the S&P 500’s 25%. The firm’s 30% run in the past three months helped it break above to new highs, yet it still trades 15% below its average Zacks price target.', 'Stride shares appear even more appealing on the valuation side, trading nearly 80% below their highs and at a 44% discount to their 10-year median at 13.5X forward earnings.', 'Netflix – Q4 Earnings on January 23', 'Netflix helped change the entertainment industry forever, altering the way people watch movies and TV shows. NFLX’s vanguard status and growing content library have helped it maintain an edge over Disney and countless other streamers. Still, the stock got crushed for slowing top expansion and fears about growing competition, as well as worries about possible consolidation in the streaming industry.', 'Netflix has addressed some of those anxieties, having also beaten our Q1, Q2, and Q3 earnings estimates. Plus, it added 8% more paid membership in Q2 and 11% more in the third quarter to close with over 247 million vs. Disney+ at 150 million.', 'Netflix’s lower-cost ad-based tier is gaining traction, with some big user growth news recently announced. NFLX is also working to cut down on people sharing too many accounts.', 'Netflix is projected to grow its revenue by over 6% in 2023 and 14% in FY24 to help boost its adjusted earnings by 22% and 32%, respectively. NFLX’s positive EPS revisions, including freshly upbeat activity, support its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) status.', 'Netflix stock has climbed nearly 200% off its lows, yet it still trades 30% below its peaks. Plus, the stock is up 933% in the last decade vs. the tech sector’s 250%. NFLX is also trading above key short-term and long-term moving averages.

And they've only climbed 51%, a gain that significantly lags the Nasdaq Composite Index. "", ""But where will Netflix be five years from now? Here's what investors should be thinking about when trying to come up with a forecast."", ""Despite a poor stock performance, Netflix's key metrics, like subscribers, revenue, and operating margin, are much higher today than they were five years ago. Looking out toward the future, I believe it's smart to assume this trend will continue. In other words, Netflix will remain the dominant streaming platform."", 'The business added nearly 8.8 million net new customers in the third quarter of 2023, the most of any single three-month period since second-quarter 2020, when the pandemic forced everyone to shelter in place. Management expects to sign on a similar number of subscribers in the fourth quarter.', ""While the U.S. and Canada are likely close to a saturation point, less developed countries across the globe can help Netflix boost its long-term business growth. Almost 70% of Netflix's membership base is outside these two markets, which means the company has a huge presence internationally."", ""Netflix's efforts to crack down on password sharing seem to be working. The ad-supported tier is also finding early success. Executives said that members of this plan represent 30% of new sign-ups in the 12 countries in which it's offered. Growth with the ad-based option should continue since it is an attractive choice for price-sensitive consumers."", ""There's no question that the streaming landscape remains incredibly competitive. People have an enormous number of entertainment options to help pass the time. But thanks to its first-mover advantage, Netflix stands out because of its massive scale, now with just under 250 million subscribers."", 'Why is this scale so important? Well, unlike most of the rival streaming services, Netflix has long been consistently profitable. Therefore, it is able to spend more on producing and licensing fresh content, while at the same time spreading these large content costs out over a bigger membership base. Subscale competitors might never be able to reach this milestone.', 'The result is that Netflix is becoming a sound financial enterprise. After posting a 20% operating margin in 2023, the leadership team predicts this metric will come in between 22% and 23% in 2024. Economies of scale continue to be put on display.', 'Even more impressive: Netflix is generating a growing amount of free cash flow, to the tune of $1.6 billion in 2022 and an estimated $6.5 billion in 2023. This allows management to buy back stock more aggressively.', ""It's really easy to believe that as Netflix keeps growing in the years ahead, its bottom line should keep expanding. This can be a boon for the stock price."", ""But even though key fundamental metrics are heading in the right direction, it doesn't automatically mean investors will be rewarded. We must also take a closer look at the current valuation, which can have a profound effect on forward returns."", ""The stock has soared since the rock-bottom summer of 2022, adding to the optimism. And as of this writing, Netflix shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 48. On its own, that's expensive. Still, it's below the trailing five-year average of 67. "", 'The important question to ask is: ""What will the stock\'s P/E ratio be in five years?"" Although this is impossible to predict, I think it\'s a likely scenario that Netflix will face valuation compression going forward due to the business becoming more mature. It doesn\'t help that the starting valuation is already very high.', ""This adds a major headwind for the stock to outperform the overall market between now and 2029. Given Netflix's sustained dominance and improving financial health, it remains an attractive prospect for long-term investors. At the same time, its lofty valuation requires a cautious approach in the ever-evolving competitive landscape."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

If they don't want to see ads, Amazon will offer the chance to upgrade Prime subscriptions to an ad-free tier for $2.99 per month."", ""The move follows similar ad-tier introductions from Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Both said they've seen a lot of success with their ad-supported tiers, and Bank of America analyst Justin Post thinks Amazon can see comparable benefits. He estimates the change will add $4.8 billion in revenue for Amazon between the higher-priced tier and additional ad revenue. And since the marginal cost of introducing ads to Prime Video is minimal, almost all of that will flow to Amazon's bottom line."", ""Here's what investors can expect when Amazon introduces ads in Prime Video."", 'The big media companies have been making their ad-supported tiers more and more attractive to consumers over the last year.', ""Amazon is following the same pricing strategy Disney adopted when it introduced its ad-supported tier for Disney+ in 2022. If subscribers didn't want to pay an extra $3 per month, they could pay the same price they had been and sit through a few ads. Last year, Disney raised prices again, but only on the ad-free versions of its streaming services."", 'Netflix introduced a low-priced ad-supported version of its service in late 2022. Subsequently, it removed the ability to sign up for its basic ad-free plan and raised the price on ad-supported plan\xa0for existing subscribers.', 'The move points to a clear preference for streaming services to push consumers to their ad-supported tier. Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts as much during last year\'s second-quarter earnings call. He\'d much rather have subscribers sign up for the ad-supported tier, ""the obvious reason [being] because the ARPU potential of the ad service Disney+.""', 'Netflix is seeing a lot of success generating ad revenue, too. In its first-quarter earnings report last year, the company said its ad-supported tier generated more revenue per account than its standard subscription plan, which charged $8.50 more per month. And that was in the middle of a weak advertising market.', 'Amazon will attempt to capture that massive upside of advertising by defaulting subscribers to the ad-supported tier. That could result in a huge new audience for advertisers when the company flips the switch on the ad tier. And it could be a massive benefit for investors.', 'Post breaks down his analysis of the Prime Video advertising opportunity simply.', ""He thinks 70% of Amazon's 150 million Prime Video viewers won't do a thing with their subscription. They'll accept the ads in exchange for not having to pay anything more per month for Prime (or go through the hassle of changing their subscription). The other 30% -- 45 million people -- will pay the extra $2.99 per month."", 'Importantly, the cost for Amazon to implement the new ad-supported tier is minimal. Amazon already has a massive advertising business that brought in more than $43 billion over the previous 12 months through the third quarter of last year. It also already has limited advertising in Prime Video during its sports broadcasts like Thursday Night Football. In other words, all the infrastructure is in place for the company to sell and deliver a lot of advertising for Prime Video.', ""So practically all of that additional revenue will flow to Amazon's operating income. Post points out that should further boost Amazon's operating margin, which is already approaching recent highs. He believes the Prime video changes could add another 50 basis points to Amazon's North American operating margin."", ""Amazon's stock climbed higher in 2023 on the back of beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in each of the first three quarters of the year. If Post is right about the impact of advertisements in Prime Video, it could result in another earnings beat and drive the stock higher still."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Last week, the company said monthly active users (MAUs) for its ad tier had surpassed 23 million. That represents a big jump over the 15 million recorded in November. In May, the ad-supported tier had only 5 million subs.', 'The accelerating pace of ad subs, says Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, indicates that Q4 net adds should come in above both the guide and Street expectations. Helfstein is calling for 10 million consolidated net adds in Q4, compared to consensus at 8.7 million.', 'Using the three announced data points for ad-supported users, Helfstein reckons ~0.7 million MAUs/month were added in 1Q23, followed by 1.25 million in Q2, 1.6 million in Q3 & 2.6 million in Q4. The 5-star analyst also thinks that “inflected” to 4 million MAU adds/month in December and January. “Over the medium-term,” says Helfstein, “we believe the pace of acceleration suggests plenty of room for sub growth in 2024.” At the end of the year, Helfstein expects ad-supported MAUs of 51 million.', 'This is all an indication that the bull thesis is strengthening. “While accelerating sub growth is positive, the faster NFLX reaches scale in advertising, the faster ARM (average revenue per membership) levels reset higher,” Helfstein explained. The good thing about advertising is that it has “significant incremental margins.” With Helfstein now anticipating $6 billion of ad revenue in 2025, factoring in a “conservative” 80% margin, this suggests $4.8 billion of incremental EBITDA compared to the total of $7.3 million in 2023E.', '“This should then allow cash content spend of $19.5/$21B in ’25/’26 vs. $17B guidance, leaving ~$17.5B of cash after $14.5B of buybacks,” Helfstein noted. “Either NFLX can increase their content moat, repurchase more stock or both.”', 'The upshot of all the above is a new price target. Helfstein’s objective moves from $475 to $600, now suggesting shares will post growth of 22% over the coming year. Helfstein’s rating stays at Outperform (i.e., Buy). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here)', 'That said, the Oppenheimer take is one of the Street’s most optimistic ones. The average price target currently stands at $491.10, practically the same price the shares are currently going for. Rating wise, the stock receives a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 25 Buys, 9 Holds and 1 Sell.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)."", 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth.

The main reason for this expected turnaround is the high likelihood that the Federal Reserve will start to cut interest rates this year, and continue this trend out till 2026. Lower interest rates would benefit the industry immensely because of the capital-intensive nature of product development in the space.', ""Another driving force is the surge of innovation in the industry. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved several important new therapies for hard-to-treat indications such as Alzheimer's, obesity, and sickle cell disease. Taken together, these two tailwinds ought to help the industry recover from its two-year slump."", 'Based on this outlook, I believe the following biotech stocks are worth a look right now. Here is the list, along with my main rationale for choosing each stock.', ""1. Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) makes this list thanks to its weight-loss candidate, maridebart cafraglutide, a.k.a. MariTide. It's in phase 2 testing with top-line data due out in Q4. If positive, Amgen's shares should rally because of the drug's multibillion-dollar peak sales estimate. Meanwhile, investors can collect the biotech's sizable dividend, which pays an annualized yield of 2.94% at current levels."", ""2. Argenx SE (NASDAQ: ARGX) is a Netherlands-based biotech company focused on the development of treatments for autoimmune disorders. The biotech scans as a strong buy because of the rapid commercial uptake of its flagship drug Vyvgart Hytrulo in patients with myasthenia gravis, a rare condition that leads to pronounced muscle weakness. Argenx has designs on expanding the drug's label to include another rare condition called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy later this year, and it is trialing the drug in several additional high-value indications."", ""3. BeiGene (NASDAQ: BGNE) is an oncology company that screens as deeply undervalued. The company sports one of the most robust clinical pipelines for both solid and liquid tumors in the industry, giving it plenty of firepower to create value for shareholders. Wall Street thinks BeiGene's shares could appreciate by 63.5% over the next 12 months. Based on the parade of upcoming pipeline readouts and the stellar commercial prospects of its approved products, I think this price target isn't unrealistic by any means."", ""4. CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) grabbed an important first-mover advantage in the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing realm with the FDA approval of Casgevy for sickle cell disease last year. While I don't expect this stock to take off like a rocket in 2024, I do think it is time to start accumulating shares of this groundbreaking company. Over the next 10 years, CRISPR's shares are highly likely to produce returns far in excess of the broader markets, thanks to the unique nature of its gene-based medicines and robust pipeline that's targeting multiple high-value indications."", ""5. Immunovant (NASDAQ: IMVT) is another autoimmune disease play. The company stands out largely because of its early stage candidate IMVT-1402. IMVT-1402 might turn out to be a best-in-class therapy in terms of both efficacy and safety in some disease settings, a fact that's likely to attract a fair amount of interest from potential acquirers. I expect this stock to steadily inch higher as additional data becomes available. That said, this is a high-risk play because of the competitive landscape and the drug's early stage nature."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amgen right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amgen wasn't one of them.

GLP-1 drugs work by mimicking the hormone GLP-1, resulting in weight loss, lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and reducing cardiovascular risks. GLP-1 drugs are approved for treating type II diabetes and obesity.', 'Some GLP-1 drugs that the FDA has approved recently are Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide medicines, which include diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, and Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide medicines, Ozempic and Rybelsus for type II diabetes and Wegovy for obesity.', 'The FDA has, over the past several months, been studying reports that claim that GLP-1 drugs cause suicidal thoughts or actions in patients taking them. However, the information in the reports was limited and did not establish any clear relationship between the use of GLP-1 drugs and suicidal thoughts, said the FDA. It also reviewed some clinical studies, which did not show any such association. The FDA is not ruling out that a small risk of suicidal thoughts may exist and will conduct further evaluations. The labels of obesity drugs, Zepbound and Wegovy, already have warnings about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions.', 'The GLP-1 segment is particularly attracting a lot of interest for the obesity indication. Obesity has become a global health problem as it can cause other diseases like heart disease, diabetes and stroke. This resulted in an exponential increase in demand for obesity medicines. Also, social media has somewhat hyped the benefits of these medications.', 'According to a Morgan Stanley report, the market for obesity drugs could reach $77 billion by 2030. Though supply issues may affect the sales growth of these drugs in the near term, with the obesity market gaining popularity, analysts expect sales to increase. A huge demand for obesity drugs for cosmetic use may be causing a supply shortage. Nonetheless, drugmakers are rushing to enter the lucrative market.', 'Lilly’s Zepbound was approved in November 2023 and launched in December. Until Zepbound was approved, Wegovy was the only GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity. Despite supply challenges, Wegovy is seeing strong prescription trends and is generating impressive revenues and profits for Novo Nordisk. However, Wegovy is expected to face significant competition from Zepbound in 2024 as the latter is priced lower than Wegovy.', 'In August, Lilly acquired private biotech Versanis, adding the latter’s lead mid-stage obesity candidate, bimagrumab, to its portfolio. Bimagrumab has the potential to show better quality weight loss by reducing fat mass while preserving muscle mass in people who are obese or have obesity-related complications.', 'Shares of Lilly and Novo Nordisk have risen 75.8% and 56.5%, respectively, in the past year, compared with an increase of 14.8% for the industry.', 'Amgen also has an interesting GLP-1 receptor candidate in its pipeline called maridebart cafraglutide, which is being developed in phase II for obesity. Maridebart cafraglutide is an antibody-peptide conjugate that has a dual mechanism of action. It activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and inhibits the GIP receptor (GIPR). Amgen has another obesity candidate in the pipeline called AMG-786, which is in phase I development.', 'In November, AstraZeneca announced an exclusive new deal with China-based private biotech Eccogene to develop the latter’s once-daily, low-dose, orally available small molecule GLP-1RA ECC5004 for treating obesity, type-II diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions.', 'While Novo Nordisk carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Lilly, Amgen and AstraZeneca have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, by the end of the year, updated forecasts suggested that copper prices would skyrocket in 2024, as the world faces deficits of the critical metal driven by more ambitious climate pledges from various countries around the globe. So, what can we expect for copper in the coming year?', 'In October, the ICSG predicted that the copper market would experience a major supply surplus in 2024, following a supply-demand balance last year. Production was expected to exceed usage by 467,000 metric tonnes in 2024, a significant increase from the 297,000 metric tonne surplus predicted for 2024 in April. However, the group made it clear that the forecast was based on the existing global project pipeline for supply and demand, which is rapidly changing as the green transition accelerates worldwide.', 'This updated forecast reflected a weak Western demand coupled with the strong Chinese copper output. By October, copper usage outside of China was expected to contract by one percent from the 2022 level “mainly impacted by declines in refined usage in EU countries and North America”, according to the ICSG. Meanwhile, China’s copper usage was expected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2023, based on the information the ICSG had available about the Chinese market. The growing demand in China has been driven by its power and electric vehicle sectors, which have remained strong despite a dip in manufacturing levels in 2023.', 'The ICSG\xa0stated, “An expected improvement in manufacturing activity, the ongoing energy transition and the development of new (semi-manufactured product) capacity in various countries should support higher growth in world refined usage in 2024.” Copper is viewed as a critical metal, vital for the construction of electric vehicles, power grids and wind turbines.', 'However, by the end of 2023, a report from the BMI Fitch Solutions research unit suggested that copper prices were expected to rise dramatically over the next two years owing to mining supply disruptions and higher demand. The report stated that it expects copper prices to rise by more than 75 percent over the next two years, driven by the acceleration of the global green transition. Prices could also be higher as the value of the dollar declines later in the year if the\xa0U.S. Federal Reserve cuts rates this year.', 'This updated prediction reflects several pledges made at the recent COP28 climate summit, where over 60 countries\xa0supported a plan to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Achieving this aim will require huge levels of copper to be produced in the coming years. In fact, higher renewable energy targets could push the global copper demand up by an additional 4.2 million tonnes by 2030. Based on this expectation, copper prices could rise to $15,000 a tonne in 2025, far higher than the previous\xa0record peak of $10,730 per tonne\xa0record last March.', 'Goldman Sachs has stated that it predicts a deficit of over half a million tonnes of copper in 2024 due to mining disruptions. In November,\xa0production was paused at the Cobre Panamá\xa0mine due to a Supreme Court ruling and widespread protests because of environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the copper producer Anglo American stated that it planned to\xa0reduce its output\xa0in 2024 and 2025 to cut costs.

Rising demand for copper is expected to spur greater investment in mining in the two countries, as well as drive export demand. Chile is home to around\xa021 percent of the world’s copper reserves. Chile is also experiencing high levels of success in its lithium industry, which is gaining greater international investment as demand rises.

NRG, SkyWest, Inc. SKYW and The Andersons, Inc. ANDE.', 'In what appears to be the first major setback in 2024 for the broader equity markets, stocks mostly trended down and traded near the flat line yesterday owing to higher-than-expected inflation data. The consumer price index increased 0.3% in December month over month and 3.4% on a year-over-year basis compared with broader expectations of a 0.2% and 3.2% rise, respectively, primarily driven by higher rents and food prices. This portrays that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to slow down inflation to its 2% target will likely remain bumpy in the year ahead.', 'Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023. However, given the recent data anomaly, the Fed might revert to its rate hike policy should inflation witness an uptrend in the near future. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations despite a relatively healthy U.S. economy and GDP data.', 'The December non-farm payrolls report showed that the jobless rate held steady at 3.7%, while the economy added 216,000 jobs compared with 173,000 revised job additions in November, signifying economic strength. The latest GDP data projections also reveal that the economy is likely to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter.Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.', 'This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?', 'There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.', 'For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.', 'Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.', 'To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.', 'In this context, stocks like NRG Energy, Inc., SkyWest, Inc. and The Andersons, Inc. are worth betting on.', 'Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.', 'Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains.

The total value of the U.S. stock market is now roughly $46 trillion, and anyone can take advantage of it. All you need to do is open a brokerage account and invest what you can."", 'Investing works best with a long time horizon, as the power of compounding means that your investment will accumulate wealth faster as it grows.', 'The chart below, which shows the value of $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 index fund (INDEX: ^SPX) 50 years ago, helps illustrate the magic of compounding.', ""As you can see, that single investment grew to more than $500,000, excluding dividends. But what's also notable is that much of the wealth created by that investment came in the last few years. In fact, about half of it came in the last seven years, while it took 43 years to make the same amount of money before that."", 'The S&P 500 is the best available proxy for the U.S. stock market. The index contains 500 large-cap U.S stocks, and the S&P Global, which runs the index, refreshes it frequently, ensuring that rising stars are added to it and laggards are removed.', 'As a result, the broad-market index has an excellent historical track record of generating wealth. Over its history, the S&P 500 has generated an average annual return of 9%, including re-invested dividends.', ""At that rate, even a middle-class income is enough to become a millionaire over time. $500 a month, for example, is less than 10% of the median U.S. household's monthly income. For example, if you are able to commit to investing $500 a month in an S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard 500 Fund (NYSEMKT: VOO), you'll eventually have $1 million, and that includes paying the 0.03% expense ratio in the ETF, meaning you'll pay 3 cents each year for every $100 you have invested in the index fund."", 'If we assume an average growth rate of 9%, it would take 31 years for that investment to reach $1 million, and that assumes that you are starting from zero. It also means that you only invested $186,000 over the course of those 31 years, getting more than five times the return on your investment.', ""Like the chart above that traces a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500, you'll find that the returns are weighted toward the end as well. According to the math, it would take you roughly 24 years to reach $500,000, but you would earn the remaining $500,000 in the next seven years. By the final year of that plan, your investment would be increasing by nearly $100,000 a year, and it would continue to accelerate into the future."", ""If you want to become a millionaire but don't want to wait 31 years, you have a couple of options. The easiest one is to invest more money. If you can commit to investing $1,000 a month, you could reach your goal within 24 years, for example, and $2,000 a month would allow you to get there in less than 18 years."", 'The other variable, which you have less control over, is your rate of return.

You can try to find another ETF that will beat the S&P 500, but doing so is difficult, and even professional money managers struggle to beat the broad-market index.', ""Buying an ETF like the Vanguard 500 Fund and committing to investing in it every month is one of the easiest ways to build wealth that you'll find.

Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 9.7%."", ""Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 6.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price."", ' See our latest analysis for Synchrony Financial ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance.

This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 6.51 also suggests market apprehension.', 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'It is of course excellent to see how Synchrony Financial has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Synchrony Financial's TSR for the last 5 years was 60%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Synchrony Financial shareholders gained a total return of 13% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 10% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It's an extraordinary record of growth that resulted from a combination of two things: Buffett's purchases of businesses outright and purchases of small pieces of quality companies\xa0through the stock market."", ""At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire's combined investment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) had a grand total of nearly $173 billion, with Apple making up most of that. Here's why any one of these top stocks would be great places to park some cash to start the new year."", ""Apple is Berkshire's largest holding, worth $156 billion at the end of the third quarter. Berkshire last added to its Apple stake in the first quarter of 2023, but the stock is up only 12% since the end of March, so it's not far above where Buffett himself or one of his investing deputies might have been buying more shares."", 'Buffett has long been an advocate of buying companies with a clear competitive advantage over rivals. He also places a high value on companies that generate profits that can be reinvested in the business at high rates of return. Apple certainly passes the latter test, earning an extraordinary return on invested capital of 56%.', ""Buffett admires Apple's ability to make products that people can't live without. It has won over millions of loyal customers, if not billions, with the installed base of devices doubling over the last seven years to 2 billion."", ""Customers who spend thousands of dollars on Apple's products are then spending more on apps, subscriptions, iCloud storage plans, AppleCare warranties, and other services, which generate much higher margins than iPhones. Services revenue has been the company's fastest-growing business in recent years, and this is contributing to a growing mountain of cash to distribute to shareholders."", ""Apple generated $99 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the last year, and it distributed about 15% of that to shareholders in quarterly dividend payments, with $77 billion going toward share buybacks. Buffett loves companies that generate lots of FCF and then use that cash to buy back shares. This reduces a company's total shares outstanding, and therefore increases Berkshire's percentage of ownership in the company."", ""Apple's brand, high margins, and high return on invested capital are great reasons to buy shares this month. Look for these qualities to lift the stock to new highs over the next few years and beyond."", ""Buffett's Berkshire has been building a large stake in top oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum over the last few years. The company bought more shares in December, bringing Berkshire's percentage ownership in the company to 34%."", 'As an energy company that derives most of its revenue from drilling, Occidental has financial results that can swing with the price of oil. The spot price in the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has fallen 8% over the last year, which has weighed on the stock price lately.', 'But Berkshire clearly likes the direction in which Occidental is moving. Occidental generated $6.9 billion in FCF over the last four quarters, despite lower oil prices. That is nearly three times what it produced five years ago.', ""Free cash flow has fallen over the last year with oil prices, but Occidental's management is making moves to keep growing FCF. In December, Occidental announced an agreement to acquire oil and gas producer Crownrock for $12 billion. While the acquisition will add to Occidental's debt burden (it ended the third quarter with $19 billion of net debt), Crownrock will also immediately benefit the company's FCF, which will prove valuable if oil prices slip."", 'Occidental has been using excess cash flow to pay down debt, buy back shares, and pay dividends -- all shareholder-friendly moves. The stock currently pays a dividend yield of 1.25% and trades at a cheap 8 times trailing FCF, which makes it clear why Berkshire was recently buying shares.', ""Mastercard stock has been a phenomenal investment for Berkshire, which held over $1.5 billion worth of the credit card brand's shares at the end of September. The stock has climbed 119% since 2019 and has a lot more upside over the long term."", 'More use of digital payment services has been a boon for leading credit card brands. It has driven more opportunities for a brand like Mastercard to become just a tap away for online and in-store payments. The company has a massive reach with 3.3 billion cards outstanding worldwide, driving over 37 billion transactions in the third quarter alone.', 'The growth of digital payments over the last decade helped drive consistent double-digit increases in revenue and earnings. Mastercard is still going strong with revenue up 11% year over year on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter.', ""One explanation for Mastercard's strong growth is that it doesn't have the risks of traditional financial institutions. It doesn't issue cards to consumers or carry any credit risk on its balance sheet."", 'Instead, it operates as a payments processor, and this business model translates to very high margins and a formidable competitive moat, since it would be too expensive to duplicate a global payment network that handles billions of transactions.', 'The business has grown FCF by 14% per year over the last decade. That growth has led to consistent increases in the dividend and share buybacks. In fact, Mastercard has returned all FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in recent years.', 'Mastercard still sees a lot of opportunities to expand acceptance of digital payments around the world, which could spell several more years of strong earnings and FCF growth. The stock returned over 400% cumulatively to shareholders over the last decade, and the next 10 years could see a similar result.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

However, by the end of the year, updated forecasts suggested that copper prices would skyrocket in 2024, as the world faces deficits of the critical metal driven by more ambitious climate pledges from various countries around the globe. So, what can we expect for copper in the coming year?', 'In October, the ICSG predicted that the copper market would experience a major supply surplus in 2024, following a supply-demand balance last year. Production was expected to exceed usage by 467,000 metric tonnes in 2024, a significant increase from the 297,000 metric tonne surplus predicted for 2024 in April. However, the group made it clear that the forecast was based on the existing global project pipeline for supply and demand, which is rapidly changing as the green transition accelerates worldwide.', 'This updated forecast reflected a weak Western demand coupled with the strong Chinese copper output. By October, copper usage outside of China was expected to contract by one percent from the 2022 level “mainly impacted by declines in refined usage in EU countries and North America”, according to the ICSG. Meanwhile, China’s copper usage was expected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2023, based on the information the ICSG had available about the Chinese market. The growing demand in China has been driven by its power and electric vehicle sectors, which have remained strong despite a dip in manufacturing levels in 2023.', 'The ICSG\xa0stated, “An expected improvement in manufacturing activity, the ongoing energy transition and the development of new (semi-manufactured product) capacity in various countries should support higher growth in world refined usage in 2024.” Copper is viewed as a critical metal, vital for the construction of electric vehicles, power grids and wind turbines.', 'However, by the end of 2023, a report from the BMI Fitch Solutions research unit suggested that copper prices were expected to rise dramatically over the next two years owing to mining supply disruptions and higher demand. The report stated that it expects copper prices to rise by more than 75 percent over the next two years, driven by the acceleration of the global green transition. Prices could also be higher as the value of the dollar declines later in the year if the\xa0U.S. Federal Reserve cuts rates this year.', 'This updated prediction reflects several pledges made at the recent COP28 climate summit, where over 60 countries\xa0supported a plan to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Achieving this aim will require huge levels of copper to be produced in the coming years. In fact, higher renewable energy targets could push the global copper demand up by an additional 4.2 million tonnes by 2030. Based on this expectation, copper prices could rise to $15,000 a tonne in 2025, far higher than the previous\xa0record peak of $10,730 per tonne\xa0record last March.', 'Goldman Sachs has stated that it predicts a deficit of over half a million tonnes of copper in 2024 due to mining disruptions. In November,\xa0production was paused at the Cobre Panamá\xa0mine due to a Supreme Court ruling and widespread protests because of environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the copper producer Anglo American stated that it planned to\xa0reduce its output\xa0in 2024 and 2025 to cut costs. Goldman analysts\xa0wrote, “The supply cuts reinforce our view that the copper market is entering a period of much clearer tightening.” The group believes that copper prices could hit $10,000 a tonne by the end of 2024, before rising even higher the following year.', 'Emerging green energy markets are expected to benefit substantially from the rising demand for critical minerals and metals, including the South American countries Chile and Peru. Rising demand for copper is expected to spur greater investment in mining in the two countries, as well as drive export demand. Chile is home to around\xa021 percent of the world’s copper reserves. Chile is also experiencing high levels of success in its lithium industry, which is gaining greater international investment as demand rises. It forms part of the lithium triangle, alongside Argentina and Bolivia, which, together, hold\xa0more than 75 percent\xa0of the world’slithium supply.', 'Despite a less-than-optimistic forecast for the copper market earlier in 2023, several end-of-year outlooks predict a far higher global demand for copper between now and 2030, driving up copper prices. This rising demand could lead to copper deficits unless governments and private companies invest heavily in mining activities to ensure that the output meets demand in support of an accelerated green transition.', 'By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Trans-Afghan Railroad Fuels Surge in Regional Trade', 'Biden Launches New Initiative to Empower Youths in Green Transition', ""Argentina's Oil Revolution: Vaca Muerta Shale Fuels Economic Hope"", 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

While use cases for AI continue to explode, one company in particular is front and center in the action."", ""Semiconductor giant Nvidia produces some of the most cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) on the market -- chips that are used to train and power generative AI models. The demand for these chips is so high that Nvidia's business sets new records every quarter."", 'The company\'s impressive results propelled Nvidia\'s market cap past the $1 trillion mark, earning it entry into an exclusive club whose only other current members are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Nvidia\'s leadership position within the semiconductor industry led Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives to dub its CEO the ""Godfather of AI.""', 'The momentum from last year has thus far continued into 2024: Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high on Jan. 8.', 'But while investors broadly continue to be enamored with Nvidia, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood just scooped up shares of a different semiconductor business. On the same day Nvidia touched that new peak, Wood added a total of roughly 58,000 shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to two of her exchange-traded funds (ETFs).', ""Let's consider why she may have done that, and assess whether the stock deserves a position in your portfolio."", 'A common theme in investing is trying to identify ""the next big thing."" But in their attempts to peer into the future, investors can sometimes convince themselves that they have found a diamond in the rough and draw conclusions that aren\'t really based on any fundamental analysis.', ""So while it's fun to speculate that Wood might view Qualcomm as the next big tech stock to break out, there is likely much more detail to the equation."", ""Instead of assuming that Wood believes Qualcomm has the same potential as Nvidia, let's break down some known parameters."", ""First, Wood is a big believer in emerging technologies. Her ETFs are invested in growth spaces ranging from autonomous driving, genomics, crypto, streaming, gaming, telemedicine, and e-commerce. Given this dynamic, it's not surprising that she would allocate a portion of her portfolio to AI -- and the semiconductor industry plays a key role in the artificial intelligence movement. Statista predicts that revenue from AI chips will grow from $53 billion in 2023 to $119 billion by 2027."", 'This large and expanding market makes it highly likely that multiple companies will emerge as major players. For this reason, Wood might see Qualcomm as an overlooked opportunity in the AI semiconductor space, which is currently dominated by Nvidia and its top rival, Advanced Micro Devices.', ""But before jumping to any conclusions, it's important to understand Qualcomm's position relative to Wood's other holdings. Right now, Qualcomm stock only accounts for 0.06% of Ark Invest's overall portfolio. By contrast, Nvidia accounts for 0.50%, while AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor comprise 0.30% and 0.17%, respectively."", ""While it's clear that Wood is diversifying Ark's exposure among chip manufacturers, and the entire semiconductor sector makes up a relatively small part of the ETF's holdings."", ""In my view, Wood's purchase of Qualcomm was merely a hedge. The number of different stocks she owns within the semiconductor industry may shed some light on her stance toward the overall market. As such, I think she is slowly building positions in the biggest brands the sector has to offer."", ""Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15, Qualcomm stock looks dirt cheap relative to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Moreover, given the S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.7, it could be that investors in general do not expect Qualcomm to be an overperformer relative to the broader market."", ""While this may appear as an opportunity to pick up shares at a relative bargain price, investors should keep in mind that Qualcomm hasn't been without its challenges. The company has struggled to grow its revenues for several quarters, and operating losses have been piling up. The company recently resorted to layoffs in an effort to curb concerns over its growth prospects."", ""I see Qualcomm as a turnaround story. While the company doesn't carry the same allure as its cohorts, management is making some strategic moves to ensure it is well-positioned to benefit from the themes fueling AI. Although I think the stock deserves to trade at a discounted valuation relative to its peers, it could be a reasonable buy at this price."", 'It was interesting to see Wood scoop up Qualcomm on shares the same day Nvidia hit an all-time high -- but that alone is no reason for you to buy this stock. In fact, the intriguing timing was probably just a coincidence.', ""If you're looking to invest in AI, semiconductor stocks are a good place to start. And while Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and others are currently perceived as leaders, Qualcomm could very well emerge as a long-term winner as it marches back toward accelerated growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of them.

And last I checked, United Launch Alliance (ULA) is still a private company.', ""Surprisingly, this means that the sale by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0of their  ULA space launch subsidiary, didn't happen as planned -- or as pundits predicted all year long in 2023. It also means we now have to ask a new question:"", 'Will Boeing and Lockheed sell ULA in 2024 instead?', 'And might ULA end up getting sold via an initial public offering (IPO)?', ""As The Wall Street Journal confirmed last month, there are (still) three companies currently bidding to acquire ULA from Boeing and Lockheed: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, defense shop Textron (NYSE: TXT), and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management."", ""Blue Origin, I argued last year, remains the leading contender, with plenty of reasons to want to own ULA -- and plenty of money to pay for it. If Blue were to acquire ULA, not only would it secure a captive customer to buy the BE-4 rocket engines that it builds. It would also own ULA's fleet of Atlas V launch vehicles still in service, as well as its design for the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which made a successful first flight just last week. That's in addition to its own New Glenn rocket that's still in development."", ""At the same time, the cost to acquire ULA -- which I've ballparked at $5.2 billion, but which several analysts have argued will fetch less -- amounts to proverbial pocket change found in the sofa cushions to a multibillionaire like Jeff Bezos."", 'Textron, a defense company probably best known for its helicopters, and having limited exposure to ""space,"" I\'d contend runs a distant second in this race. On the one hand, the company boasts a reasonably strong balance sheet, with $15.3 billion in market capitalization and only about $2.2 billion in net debt.', ""But the company doesn't have enough cash to buy ULA outright, without issuing new shares or taking on more debt. Textron does run a reasonably profitable business, generating $858 million in free cash flow over the past year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Over time, it could probably pay down any debt it takes on to buy ULA. But the purchase would still be a stretch -- and I just can't see Textron winning a bidding war against Jeff Bezos."", 'Cerberus is something of a wild card. On the one hand, the private equity powerhouse could potentially face down Bezos in a bidding war. On multibillion-dollar deals, Cerberus often recruits other investors to act alongside it, giving it the ability to offer higher prices while still spreading out its risk.', ""Cerberus has also shown an interest in space companies of late, buying midair rocket launch company Stratolaunch just before it went bankrupt in 2019 -- then turning around and using Stratolaunch to place a $17 million bid for some of Virgin Orbit's assets after that company did go bankrupt last year."", ""Still, to date Cerberus' reputation has been as a bit of a vulture and a bargain shopper in the space industry, picking up assets that no one else wanted in hopes of whipping them into shape and making them viable again. Paying through the nose to acquire one of America's two biggest space companies really doesn't seem Cerberus' speed to me. (If Cerberus did buy it, though, it'd likely turn around and later sell it again in an IPO -- see below)."", 'Which, again, is why I conclude that Blue Origin is the most likely buyer of United Launch Alliance.', ""And yet, what if I'm wrong? Or what if I'm right that Boeing and Lockheed will try to sell ULA to Blue Origin, but the Federal Trade Commission intervenes -- perhaps arguing that merging Blue and ULA would reduce competition in the space sector -- and forbids a sale?"", 'In that case, Boeing and Lockheed Martin will have a decision to make. They may decide to keep running ULA as a joint venture. Or they might try to sell ULA to everybody -- to hold an IPO and make United Launch Alliance its own publicly traded company.', 'With ULA coming off a successful maiden flight of its Vulcan Centaur rocket last week, and the company loudly trumpeting its backlog of 70 Vulcan launches already reserved, worth billions of dollars in future revenue, the time seems ripe for an IPO. Investors, too, would probably be very interested in such an event. With SpaceX still playing a perpetual game of ""will I or won\'t I"" (ever IPO), investors tired of waiting for the chance to invest in SpaceX might jump at the chance to own a ULA IPO as a reasonable alternative to investing in SpaceX.', 'Come to think of it, if the profit margins are good enough -- I might jump at that chance as well.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

Taking a broader focus this year, the study expanded its scope to examine the mental health and wellbeing of veterinary team members – including veterinary technicians and office managers – with nearly five times more responses from these positions than the 2021 survey."", ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0""There are many positives coming out of the study, including high levels of job satisfaction and pride in work across veterinary teams. This must be balanced with the understanding that there are also challenges within the veterinary profession, including a shortage of qualified veterinary team members as well as burdensome student debt that causes stress,"" said Christine Royal, DVM, vice president, companion animal and equine business unit, Merck Animal Health. ""It is encouraging to see an increase in practices and professionals that are addressing team culture, wellbeing, and mental health. We remain committed to advocating for and providing resources to veterinary professionals no matter the individual\'s role or title.""', ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0""We are committed to bringing critical awareness to the challenges that veterinary professionals face and to ensure they have the appropriate tools and resources to help support mental health and wellbeing,"" said Rena Carlson, DVM, AVMA president. ""We understand that to sustain the health of animals, we need to ensure the wellbeing of their caretakers. The results of the latest Veterinary Wellbeing study indicate our efforts in conjunction with Merck Animal Health are working and resulting in healthier and more satisfying careers for veterinary teams. We look forward to continuing to provide resources for many years to come.""', ""Increase in Mental Health Resources for Professionals\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Almost three-quarters of veterinary professionals express personal satisfaction with their career, but there are still factors they are concerned about, including high exhaustion, work-life balance, and shortage of vets, all of which can contribute to a feeling of burnout.\xa0Results indicate that more veterinarians who needed mental health support received outpatient treatment and counseling for mental health challenges in 2023. Moreover, there has been a substantial increase in clinics supporting their team's mental health and emotional wellbeing, with results showing that 38% of clinics now offer an employee assistance program (EAP) as opposed to 31% in 2021 and 27% in 2019."", ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When it comes to clinic culture, most practicing veterinarians agree that there is a high degree of trust within their organization, their input is valued, there is sufficient time for each appointment to provide high-quality patient care, and there is candid and open communication among team members, which all contribute to a positive work environment. However, the results indicate that clinics have the opportunity to make improvements by openly discussing wellbeing and mental health in team meetings, with only 36% of veterinary teams finding that this happens somewhat or to a great extent.', ""Pride and Satisfaction in the Profession\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While veterinarians and support teams – particularly those early in their career – experience stress and burnout, there are many aspects of the job they enjoy – unsurprisingly, including those related to helping animals. An overwhelming number of veterinarians (98%) and veterinary team members (92%)\xa0note that they are invested in their work and take pride in doing a good job. More than 80% also believe the work they do makes a positive contribution on other peoples' lives."", ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Even with these results indicating an overall satisfaction in the profession, there is a perception among veterinary teams that it might not be the same for their colleagues, with less than 50% of veterinarians saying that others in the profession are satisfied with their careers. This could indicate the continued need for open communication about wellbeing and the resources available to perpetuate more positive conversation and pride in the work that veterinary teams do every day. Thankfully, over three-quarters of veterinarians and veterinary team members cite having a warm, friendly, and supportive relationship with their co-workers, a critical foundation for this important dialogue to advance.', ""Encouraging Conversation about Prioritizing Mental Health\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Merck Animal Health has prioritized understanding the challenges that face veterinarians and veterinary technicians by issuing this important study every two years since 2017. The results continue to provide insight on the progress made and the areas that need additional attention. Key initiatives such as MentorVet, a growing entity that creates evidence-based programming to empower individuals to thrive within veterinary medicine, help facilitate guidance and support for veterinary professionals and continue to play a crucial role in fostering a supportive environment within the industry. To date, more than 350 veterinary professionals have been supported with full scholarships awarded by Merck Animal Health to participate in MentorVet's programming (MentorVet Tech and MentorVet Leap), helping to bridge the gap when it comes to the wellbeing of veterinary professionals."", ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0""Our research indicates that MentorVet programming reduces burnout and improves overall wellbeing on average for veterinary professionals, and our work is made possible through collaboration,"" said Addie Reinhard, DVM, MS, and founder and CEO of MentorVet. ""Merck Animal Health has demonstrated an unwavering, longstanding commitment to support the mental health and wellbeing of the veterinary profession through their research and their long-term support of MentorVet and other wellbeing initiatives.""', ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In addition, Merck Animal Health is an educational partner for MentorVet Connect, a collaboration between the AVMA and MentorVet that brings the power and support of a structured evidence-based mentor program to newly graduated AVMA members free of charge, beginning with the classes of 2018-2023. The joining of forces and organizations helps drive not only the creation of resources and mentorship, but also the adoption of them among veterinarian professionals.', ' \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Merck Animal Health remains dedicated to advancing the wellbeing of veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and the entire animal healthcare team in 2024 and beyond. The company is committed to expanding and enhancing its existing programs, as well as introducing new initiatives aimed at addressing the evolving needs of professionals within the industry.', "" \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To learn more about Merck Animal Health's support of veterinary professionals and their mental wellbeing, visit www.vetwellbeing.com.

The objectives were to continue to track wellbeing and mental health of veterinarians and benchmark findings against physicians and the U.S. general population of employed adults. Data were weighted based on age, gender, and region of the U.S. For the sample as a whole, the maximum margin of error was +/- 1.4% at 95% confidence level.', "" \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0To achieve a comprehensive study of veterinary team members in 2023, Brakke Consulting collaborated with the North American Veterinary Technician Association (NAVTA), the Veterinary Hospital Managers Association (VHMA) and others to sample veterinary technicians, veterinary assistants, hospital practice managers, reception/client service representatives and other members of a veterinary clinic's team. A total of 2,271 completed questionnaires were returned."", ""About AVMA\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Serving more than 105,000 member veterinarians, the AVMA is the nation's leading representative of the veterinary profession, dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of animals, humans and the environment.

Finding the best robotics stocks is not only a stroke of luck for savvy investors looking to exploit this highly-growing industry. It is an adventure into world automation and artificial intelligence. These organizations are pioneering the use of advanced robotic technology in transforming various industries such as manufacturing and health. It is an intersection where innovation meets pragmatism, giving the world some spectacular breakthroughs and for those wise ones who invest in them – a future of bright financial prospects.', 'Diving deeper, we find a land quite diverse, filled with companies excelling at different niches of the robotics domain. Each contributes uniquely, offering sophisticated software, innovative hardware, or path-breaking integration systems.', 'This diversity not only drives the industry’s development but also offers investors with different choices. The range of options from established giants who are emerging with promising new technologies to nimble start-ups that shake tradition shows the dynamism of this sector. In this constantly changing environment, the best way to uncover value is by realizing each competitor’s specific advantages and possibilities. With this in mind, let’s examine three high-quality plays in the robotics field.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a medical technology giant, known for its advances in robotics and continuing to make improvements and accomplishments in the industry. It has proven a solid market player in the past five years churning out an impressive 85% return.', 'Furthermore, the third quarter of this year SYK reported a significant increase in revenue to $4.91 billion, as opposed to 83% from previous quarters. However, it also disclosed a 15% loss in net income of $692 million. These figures reveal the dynamic financial atmosphere in which growth and challenges simultaneously take place.', 'In the medical field, one should also consider a promising move into robotics by the company including Mako SmartRobotics system. This innovative orthopedic surgery technology has revolutionized the whole scenario by providing precision and improved clinical outcomes. Stryker Corporation seems to devote much to this field, as seen from its R&D activities, which ensures further robotics developments. Such initiatives have considerably helped the financial success of the company, per its continued use of Mako surgical robots.', 'Stryker is not just concerned with the development of products from a strategic point of view. It involves a whole approach including complete training systems and medical education. This strategy increases the use of robotic technology in surgeries and meets standards for operations demanded by modern medical practice. Such initiatives not only strengthen SYK’s status within the medical robots industry but also show commitment to enhance surgical results and patient management. Similarly, the multifaceted approach highlights Stryker Corporation as a leading player in an increasingly sophisticated healthcare scene. As a result, when considering the best robotics stocks, you cannot ignore this quality play.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/AntonovVitalii', 'Hyundai Motor Company (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) recently demonstrated a robust recovery, achieving a total return exceeding 30% in the past year.

Moreover, in the US, Hyundai set an all-time record in 2023 with sales soaring above 801,000, contributing to over one million vehicles sold – a significant rise from the previous year’s figures.', 'Also, HYMTF India sales increase is commendable with 9% growth of total sales. Hyundai Motor India Ltd. sold the highest in domestic sales recorded by any firm. Such milestones in critical markets reveal Hyundai’s growing global presence. Also, HYMTF thrives by forming alliances, such as the one with Kia who increases its sales. The automaker sold 7.3 million units together in the year, which depicts a common strength for another car market.', 'The interest of Hyundai in robotics as an innovative direction is clear enough. Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in its Alabama plant to make production efficient. These AMR-lifting heavy loads offer an effective solution to labor shortages. This gesture proves that the company is a progressive manufacturer. Further, Hyundai’s interest in EV robotics and advanced air mobility is shown by Executive Chair Euisun Chung.', 'Overall, the recent accomplishments and future prospects of Hyundai Motor Company place it on a list of the best robotics stocks to consider.

70,1ec6b61b-3b9e-3f31-8b2e-51f97f698696,BA,2024-01-15,Will United Launch Alliance Have an IPO in 2024?,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1ec6b61b-3b9e-3f31-8b2e-51f97f698696/will-united-launch-alliance.html,1705320420,STORY,"['LMT', 'TXT', 'BA']","['2023 has come and gone. 2024 is here. And last I checked, United Launch Alliance (ULA) is still a private company.', ""Surprisingly, this means that the sale by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0of their  ULA space launch subsidiary, didn't happen as planned -- or as pundits predicted all year long in 2023. It also means we now have to ask a new question:"", 'Will Boeing and Lockheed sell ULA in 2024 instead?', 'And might ULA end up getting sold via an initial public offering (IPO)?', ""As The Wall Street Journal confirmed last month, there are (still) three companies currently bidding to acquire ULA from Boeing and Lockheed: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, defense shop Textron (NYSE: TXT), and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management."", ""Blue Origin, I argued last year, remains the leading contender, with plenty of reasons to want to own ULA -- and plenty of money to pay for it. If Blue were to acquire ULA, not only would it secure a captive customer to buy the BE-4 rocket engines that it builds. It would also own ULA's fleet of Atlas V launch vehicles still in service, as well as its design for the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which made a successful first flight just last week. That's in addition to its own New Glenn rocket that's still in development."", ""At the same time, the cost to acquire ULA -- which I've ballparked at $5.2 billion, but which several analysts have argued will fetch less -- amounts to proverbial pocket change found in the sofa cushions to a multibillionaire like Jeff Bezos."", 'Textron, a defense company probably best known for its helicopters, and having limited exposure to ""space,"" I\'d contend runs a distant second in this race. On the one hand, the company boasts a reasonably strong balance sheet, with $15.3 billion in market capitalization and only about $2.2 billion in net debt.', ""But the company doesn't have enough cash to buy ULA outright, without issuing new shares or taking on more debt. Textron does run a reasonably profitable business, generating $858 million in free cash flow over the past year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Over time, it could probably pay down any debt it takes on to buy ULA. But the purchase would still be a stretch -- and I just can't see Textron winning a bidding war against Jeff Bezos."", 'Cerberus is something of a wild card. On the one hand, the private equity powerhouse could potentially face down Bezos in a bidding war. On multibillion-dollar deals, Cerberus often recruits other investors to act alongside it, giving it the ability to offer higher prices while still spreading out its risk.', ""Cerberus has also shown an interest in space companies of late, buying midair rocket launch company Stratolaunch just before it went bankrupt in 2019 -- then turning around and using Stratolaunch to place a $17 million bid for some of Virgin Orbit's assets after that company did go bankrupt last year."", ""Still, to date Cerberus' reputation has been as a bit of a vulture and a bargain shopper in the space industry, picking up assets that no one else wanted in hopes of whipping them into shape and making them viable again. Paying through the nose to acquire one of America's two biggest space companies really doesn't seem Cerberus' speed to me. (If Cerberus did buy it, though, it'd likely turn around and later sell it again in an IPO -- see below)."", 'Which, again, is why I conclude that Blue Origin is the most likely buyer of United Launch Alliance.', ""And yet, what if I'm wrong? Or what if I'm right that Boeing and Lockheed will try to sell ULA to Blue Origin, but the Federal Trade Commission intervenes -- perhaps arguing that merging Blue and ULA would reduce competition in the space sector -- and forbids a sale?"", 'In that case, Boeing and Lockheed Martin will have a decision to make. They may decide to keep running ULA as a joint venture. Or they might try to sell ULA to everybody -- to hold an IPO and make United Launch Alliance its own publicly traded company.', 'With ULA coming off a successful maiden flight of its Vulcan Centaur rocket last week, and the company loudly trumpeting its backlog of 70 Vulcan launches already reserved, worth billions of dollars in future revenue, the time seems ripe for an IPO. Investors, too, would probably be very interested in such an event. With SpaceX still playing a perpetual game of ""will I or won\'t I"" (ever IPO), investors tired of waiting for the chance to invest in SpaceX might jump at the chance to own a ULA IPO as a reasonable alternative to investing in SpaceX.', 'Come to think of it, if the profit margins are good enough -- I might jump at that chance as well.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.', 'See the 10 stocks', '\xa0', '*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024', '\xa0', 'Rich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The company’s computer & networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.

The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term.

Last week, though, NASA tweaked the terms of its support to award nearly $100 million in funding to just the last two.', ""Citing Northrop Grumman's abandonment of a plan to build its own space station and its decision to team up with Voyager instead, NASA advised that it would divert funds originally intended for Northrop's project to the team building the Starlab. Simultaneously, the space agency said it is awarding new funds to Orbital Reef as well."", 'Specifically, the Starlab project will receive $57.5 million in new NASA funding, bringing its total level of government support to $217.5 million. Orbital Reef will get another $42 million from NASA, bringing its total to $172 million. (Axiom has a different deal with NASA -- a firm, fixed-price contract worth $140 million to build and attach to the International Space Station at least one and possibly more new habitation modules).', ""That's an excellent question. Why isn't NASA building its own ISS replacement? NASA hired contractors to build the American modules of the current International Space Station, which America then owned. Why is it that this time, NASA's just giving money to companies to build stations that America will not end up owning -- that the companies will get to keep?"", ""And basically, the answer is that building a space station is really expensive. It cost something on the order of $100 billion to build ISS, and much of that was spent in the form of year-2000 dollars before inflation really took off. In today's dollars, the cost might be closer to $184 billion. Yet right now, NASA has its hands full just trying to pay the bills for its Project Artemis effort to put astronauts back on the moon, and can't really afford the cost of building a replacement ISS at the same time."", ""So, instead, the plan is to give a few companies some start-up money, then award them contracts to assure them they'll have a reliable revenue stream leasing space to and performing services for NASA (and others) in the future -- and let them build their own stations. This way, NASA sidesteps much of the upfront costs and shifts most of the financial burden to its contractors."", 'Of course, the obvious question then arises: Should investors want to take on that risk by investing in whoever ends up building the space station(s) to replace ISS? And the answer is, ""That depends.""', ""At present, the amounts of money we're talking about -- $217.5 million here, $172 million there, and over at Axiom, just $140 million -- aren't really huge numbers. Barely half a billion dollars in total and barely a rounding error if we assume the cost of building something to replace ISS might ultimately approach $184 billion."", 'As plans progress, however, and designs firm up, NASA says it will begin awarding contracts for the ""procurement of services from one or more companies, where NASA aims to be one of many customers for low Earth orbit destinations."" Only when we see the size and number of those contracts (and get a better idea of the companies\' estimates for the cost to build their stations) will we be able to determine how profitable these stations might become.', ""In the meantime, in-between time, we'll just keep on doing what we've been doing consistently for the last two years -- watching carefully, counting up the numbers, and letting you know what we find out."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Quanta Services ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Quanta Services' EPS has grown 20% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Quanta Services maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 18% to US$20b. That's a real positive."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$356m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!"", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Quanta Services' strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment.

You still see such stories, but analysts no longer pay attention to them.', 'In 2021 Skyworks bought Silicon Laboratories, hoping that chips for autos would reduce its Apple dependence. So far, they haven’t.', 'When they’re not fretting about Skyworks’ dependence on Apple, bears are worried about Apple walking away.', 'Apple has long focused on supplying its own silicon.

There are currently 24 of them, with 9 saying buy it and 2 saying sell.', 'Nowhere in that quarterly release does Griffin mention AI. That’s interesting because much of Skyworks’ non-Apple growth should come from client devices.

It cost something on the order of $100 billion to build ISS, and much of that was spent in the form of year-2000 dollars before inflation really took off. In today's dollars, the cost might be closer to $184 billion. Yet right now, NASA has its hands full just trying to pay the bills for its Project Artemis effort to put astronauts back on the moon, and can't really afford the cost of building a replacement ISS at the same time."", ""So, instead, the plan is to give a few companies some start-up money, then award them contracts to assure them they'll have a reliable revenue stream leasing space to and performing services for NASA (and others) in the future -- and let them build their own stations. This way, NASA sidesteps much of the upfront costs and shifts most of the financial burden to its contractors."", 'Of course, the obvious question then arises: Should investors want to take on that risk by investing in whoever ends up building the space station(s) to replace ISS? And the answer is, ""That depends.""', ""At present, the amounts of money we're talking about -- $217.5 million here, $172 million there, and over at Axiom, just $140 million -- aren't really huge numbers. Barely half a billion dollars in total and barely a rounding error if we assume the cost of building something to replace ISS might ultimately approach $184 billion."", 'As plans progress, however, and designs firm up, NASA says it will begin awarding contracts for the ""procurement of services from one or more companies, where NASA aims to be one of many customers for low Earth orbit destinations."" Only when we see the size and number of those contracts (and get a better idea of the companies\' estimates for the cost to build their stations) will we be able to determine how profitable these stations might become.', ""In the meantime, in-between time, we'll just keep on doing what we've been doing consistently for the last two years -- watching carefully, counting up the numbers, and letting you know what we find out."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

This week’s list includes Bank of America BAC, JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C & Wells Fargo WFC.', 'We are off to a good enough start in the Q4 earnings season, though it may be hard to reach that conclusion from the seemingly ‘noisy’ big bank results. Please note that the bank results aren’t bad or weak, though most struggled to beat consensus revenue estimates.', 'Bank of America’s Q4 earnings declined -17.3% from the year-earlier period on -10.5% lower revenues. The bank’s Q4 earnings actually beat estimates, so the year-over-year decline, largely due to the FDIC fee, was no surprise to the market. The combined FDIC fee for the four big banks – Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup & Wells Fargo – collectively paid $9 billion in the FDIC fee.', 'Bank of America continued to enjoy strong net interest earnings in the quarter, though the tally was modestly below the year-earlier period. The bank’s strong net interest earnings performance mirrored what we saw from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and even Citigroup, who appeared to be following a kitchen-sink approach in its Q4 earnings release.', 'With respect to the 2024 outlook for this key profitability driver, JPMorgan expects its net interest earnings to be flat, Wells Fargo is projecting a high single-digit decline, and Citi expects a ‘modest’ decline. This all makes sense, given the expected decline in rates and the macro-driven moderation in credit demand.', 'Credit quality metrics have started weakening but remain well within ‘normal’ ranges. The commercial real estate space is particularly vulnerable in this respect, though exposure to the ‘office’ market is a much bigger issue for the regional banks than these money-center operators. The Q4 reporting cycle expands to the regional banks and brokers this week.', 'In terms of the Finance sector’s Q4 scorecard, we now have results from 22.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these banks are up +6.3% from the same period last year on +2.3% higher revenues, with all of the banks beating EPS estimates (100% beats percentage) and only 50% exceeding revenue estimates. The lower revenue beats percentage for the banks is a trend we are noticing outside of the Finance sector as well.', '2022 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +0.1% on +2.2% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.', 'This chart, which accurately represents current bottom-up consensus earnings expectations aggregated to the index level, does not see an earnings recession over the next three quarters. If anything, revenue growth is trending up over this period.', 'It isn’t just the next three quarters where the long-feared recession is missing in action, but actually over the next two years as well, as you can see above.', 'The earnings recession proponents have been telling us for more than a year that earnings estimates were out-of-sync with the underlying economic reality and needed to be cut in a big way.', 'We did see a period of significant negative estimate revisions that started in April 2022 and lasted for about a year. During that period, estimates in the aggregate declined by about -15% from peak to trough, with the magnitude of negative revisions for several sectors exceeding -20%. These included Construction, Consumer Discretionary, Technology, and Retail.', 'The revisions trend stabilized in April 2023, with earnings estimates for several major sectors, including the Tech sector, starting to go up again. This favorable revisions trend remained in place until October 2023 when estimates started easing all over again.', 'The current reading on the revisions trend is that they appear to have stabilized again.', 'One sector whose earnings outlook appears to have notably turned around is the Tech sector. This sector has a bigger bearing on the aggregate earnings picture than any of the 15 Zacks sectors in the S&P 500 index, as it is on track to bring in more than 28% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period.', 'Other sectors whose 2024 earnings estimates also appear to have inched up lately include Retail, Autos, Aerospace, and Utilities.', 'While estimates for all the other sectors are still under pressure, sectors facing the most pressure on estimates include Transportation, Industrial Products, and Consumer Discretionary.', 'Including Friday’s results from the big banks, we now have Q4 results from 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 29 index members are up +7.6% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 93.1% beating EPS estimates and 55.2% beating revenue estimates.', 'We have about 50 companies on deck to report results this week, including 23 S&P 500 members. As noted earlier, this week’s reporting docket is dominated by the major regional banks and the major brokerage firms, which includes Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.', 'This is way too small a sample of results to draw conclusions about the coming reporting season. But at this early stage,', 'Earnings and revenue growth rates for this group of 29 index members are tracking roughly in line with what we had seen for the same group of companies in other recent periods', 'Companies are beating EPS estimates comfortably, but appear to be struggling with beating revenue estimates.', 'For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings Season Gets Underway ', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The company's breakthrough vaccine helped pave the way for a post-pandemic world. Over the last couple of years, demand for Pfizer's COVID-19 treatments helped spur record-breaking revenue."", ""However, as pandemic concerns wane, some investors may wonder where Pfizer's next growth engine lies. While the company has several catalysts identified, I have my doubts on their prospects. And I'm not the only one. With the stock trading at just $29 per share, Pfizer shares are currently hovering around their lowest levels in 10 years."", ""Let's dig into the current state of Pfizer and assess if now is an opportunity to buy the dip, or move on and seek growth elsewhere."", ""Pfizer's COVID-19-related treatments are broken into two categories: Comirnaty and Paxlovid. In 2022, Pfizer reported total revenue of $100.3 billion -- representing 23% growth year over year and a record for the company. This momentum probably wasn't too surprising, given Pfizer essentially doubled its revenue between 2020 and 2021. Much of this growth can be attributed to the blockbuster success of the company's COVID-19 medications, which combined for 57% of total sales in 2022."", ""What might be surprising, however, is the precipitous decline of Pfizer's COVID-19 revenue streams. Per Pfizer's third-quarter results, ended Sept. 30, revenue from Comirnaty and Paxlovid decreased 70% and 97%, respectively."", ""To be fair, these drop-off rates should be expected on some level -- given that COVID-19 appears to have subsided from its peak. Nevertheless, seeing the impact these declines have had on Pfizer's business is a bit jarring. Through the first nine months of 2023, Pfizer reported earnings per share (EPS) of just $0.97 -- down 79% year over year."", ""With revenue projected to shrink by roughly 40% in 2023, coupled with the company's deteriorating profits, could Pfizer's picture actually get any worse?"", 'Predicting the future prospects of a business and its stock price is both irresponsible and ultimately an exercise in false precision. There are a couple of reasons why I think Pfizer could be headed for further challenges, though.', 'For starters, one of the hottest catalysts fueling the pharmaceutical industry is the rising popularity of weight management medications. Treatments including Ozempic, Wegovy, Jardiance, and Mounjaro have taken the world by storm. However, all of these medications are developed by just two companies: Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Pfizer was looking to get involved in this market as well, but after a series of blunders with its own diabetes and obesity treatments, I have my doubts.', ""Another reason I am bearish on Pfizer revolves around its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. Per the company's initial 2024 guidance, Seagen is expected to contribute roughly $3.1 billion in revenue to Pfizer this year. However, the company is projecting total sales to be flat year over year."", ""I understand that it can be years before the revenue and cost benefits from acquisitions fully take shape. But with over $30 billion of newly issued debt on the balance sheet to finance the Seagen deal, coupled with the company's declining top line and uninspiring growth prospects, I have some concerns about the business."", ""As of the time of this article, Pfizer trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9 -- well below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.7."", 'While this could be viewed as an opportunity to scoop up shares while expectations are low, I think the discount to the broader market is warranted. A lot of things need to go right for Pfizer in order to get back on a growth path.', ""Although this is entirely feasible, I wouldn't be surprised if the integration of Seagen takes longer than anticipated -- thereby causing monetization efforts to stall. Moreover, with its cash cow COVID-19 products falling out of favor, Pfizer is going to need to identify some new catalysts sooner than later."", ""For me, a position in Pfizer presents too much risk at the moment. While I applaud the company's innovation from a couple of years ago, I have serious questions about the long-term picture and management's ability to execute. For this reason, I am looking elsewhere and passing on Pfizer in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

After all, the drugmaker pays a sizzling 5.92% dividend yield, its shares trade at under 13 times forward earnings, and it has a robust clinical pipeline, with 83 programs in development. Pfizer's recent acquisition of Seagen also puts it in the top tier of antibody-drug conjugate manufacturers, a space forecast to grow by double digits over the next five years."", ""However, Pfizer is also coming off a bad year, commercially speaking. The company's COVID-19 product sales underwhelmed investors and some new product launches -- such as its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, Abrysvo -- missed internal sales targets. With this brief background in mind, here are two reasons to consider buying shares of the pharma titan, and one reason it might be wise to stick to the sidelines."", ""One reason to buy Pfizer is its shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. The company pays a solid dividend that has increased every year for more than a decade, and it also repurchases shares regularly to boost earnings per share. Over the last 20 years, for instance, Pfizer has reduced its outstanding share count by an impressive 26%. Its top-tier shareholder rewards program has helped the company's stock beat the broader market over several multiyear stretches in the past 20 years, although its poor showing last year dramatically dampened its long-term performance."", 'Another reason to buy Pfizer is its robust clinical pipeline and aggressive merger and acquisition strategy. The company is pursuing novel therapies for obesity, a major health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. It is also expected to report top-line results from its gene therapy program (fordadistrogene movaparvovec) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal genetic disorder, later this year. These high-value product candidates could generate significant revenue for Pfizer in the future.', ""But there is one reason to avoid the stock: Pfizer's growth strategy is not without risks. The company has spent billions of dollars on acquiring other biotechs -- such as Arena Pharmaceuticals, Seagen, and Global Blood Therapeutics, among others -- but it is not clear whether these deals will pay off in the long run. Some of these recent portfolio additions face intense competition from therapies that may turn out to be markedly superior in terms of safety and/or efficacy. And if this scenario plays out, the drugmaker might struggle to simply recoup its investment in these pricey assets."", 'Pfizer is a quality company with a lot of positives, but it is also experiencing portfolio churn that poses unique risks for shareholders. So if you are looking for a stable dividend stock with a high yield and modest growth potential, you might want to consider buying Pfizer in 2024.', ""However, if you are looking for a stock capable of consistently beating the broader market, you might want to look elsewhere. After all, Pfizer's top line is only forecast to rise by 2.7% this year, which probably won't convince Wall Street that it deserves a premium valuation."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

It is among a growing list of lawsuits against corporate diversity and inclusion programs that are making their way through the courts this year.', 'Most have been filed by conservative activists encouraged by the Supreme Court’s June ruling ending affirmative action in college admissions and are now seeking to set a similar precedent in the working world.', 'The battle has been a roller coaster of setbacks and victories for both sides, but some companies are already retooling their diversity programs in the face of legal challenges, and the growing expectation that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court will eventually take up the issue.', 'One conservative activist, Christopher Rufo, claimed another victory this month with the resignation of Harvard’s first Black woman president, Claudine Gay, after allegations of plagiarism and a furor over her congressional testimony about antisemitism.', 'Rufo, who has cast Gay’s appointment to the job as the culmination of diversity and inclusion efforts that have sidelined conservative voices in higher education, vowed on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, not to “stop until we have abolished DEI ideology from every institution in America.”', 'Dozens of prominent companies have already been targeted, as well as a wide array of diversity initiatives, including fellowships, hiring goals, anti-bias training and contract programs for minority or women-owned businesses.', 'Some challenges have focused on policies adopted after the 2020 protests over George Floyd’s killing by police as companies pledged more efforts to redress racial inequalities in the workplace. But others have targeted decades-old diversity programs that anti-affirmative action advocates have long tried to dismantle.', 'Diversity and inclusion experts say the legal backlash is already having a chilling effect over corporate efforts to address workplace inequality at a time when investment and interest in such initiatives have slowed following the post-Floyd surge.', 'Job openings for diversity officers and similar positions have declined in recent months. The combined share of venture capital funding for businesses owned by Black and Latina women has dipped back to less than 1% after briefly surpassing that threshold — at 1.05% — in 2021 following a jump in 2020, according to the nonprofit advocacy group digitalundivided.', 'The case against the Fearless Fund, which provides early-stage funding to businesses led by women of color, exemplifies the unpredictable legal landscape.', 'In late September, a federal judge in Atlanta refused to block a Fearless Fund grant contest for Black women business owners, saying they are donations protected by the First Amendment and the lawsuit was likely to fail. But days later, a three-judge federal appeals panel suspended the contest, calling it “racially exclusionary” and saying the suit was likely to succeed.', '“Am I going to be able to apply to grants like these? Are they even going to exist?” said Danner-Okotie, who received $10,000 from a separate Fearless Fund grant. “With this last ruling, it seems like no.”', 'Danner-Okotie first saw the potential for scaling her clothing brand when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the boutiques and fairs that carried her designs. Searching for ways to increase her online sales, she landed a contract with subscriber-based retailer Stitch Fix and used a government pandemic relief loan to fulfill the order. But when she tried to build on that success, she ran into roadblocks as banks declined her loan applications, deeming her business model risky since her clothes are handmade by Nigerian tailors.', 'The Fearless Fund, Danner-Okotie said, grasped her mission of designing clothes for American women looking to celebrate their African heritage. The grant was a game changer, allowing her to contract a factory in India to make uniquely designed fabrics for her team of tailors in Nigeria.', 'But now, future funding from the program is in jeopardy. The lawsuit against the Fearless Fund is being brought by the American Alliance for Equal Rights, a nonprofit founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, the man behind the college admissions cases the Supreme Court ruled on in June. The outcome of the case could be a bellwether for similar diversity programs.', 'Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Jan. 31.', 'ADJUSTING DIVERSITY PROGRAMS', 'Faced with a messy legal landscape, companies are being cautious. Most major companies have stuck by diversity initiatives that many ramped up in the face of pressure from some shareholders, employees and customers. Starbucks and Disney are among companies that have so far prevailed in court against challenges to their inclusion policies.', 'But some have made changes to diversity programs to try to protect them from legal scrutiny.', 'Among those are two prominent law firms that had faced lawsuits by Blum’s group. The firms, Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, opened their diversity fellowship programs to all applicants of all races in October, changes the companies said were in the works before Blum’s lawsuits, which he subsequently dropped.', 'In February, Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, even though a judge had dismissed a lawsuit against the program two months earlier. Despite the change, the conservative nonprofit suing Pfizer, Do No Harm, is appealing the lawsuit’s dismissal, arguing the fellowship’s goals remain the same.', 'In May, Comcast said business owners of all backgrounds would be eligible to apply for a grant program originally intended for women and people of color when it launched in 2020. The telecommunications settled a lawsuit last year over the program brought by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty on behalf of the white owner of a commercial cleaning business.', 'The Wisconsin Institute filed another lawsuit in October, this one on behalf of two construction firms. The lawsuit seeks to dismantle the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which dates back to the Reagan administration and requires that 10% of funds authorized for highway and transit federal assistance programs be expended with small businesses owned by women, minorities or other socially and economically disadvantaged people.', 'Dan Lennington, an attorney with the Wisconsin Institute, said he considers Comcast’s changes “progress,” but the anti-affirmative action movement is looking for a broader victory that could change case law on workplace diversity programs, and the lawsuit against the DOT has that potential.', 'The Supreme Court’s ruling on affirmative action “opened up a whole new world,” Lennington said. “This decision just really injected new life into the whole debate.”', 'A GRAY AREA ON HIRING', 'Many of the lawsuits challenging diversity programs, including the cases against Pfizer and the Fearless Fund, are relying on a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which prohibits racial discrimination in contract agreements. The law was originally intended to protect formerly enslaved people, but conservative activists are citing it to challenge programs designed to benefit racial minorities.', ""Their lawsuits generally target programs that have clear race-based eligibility components. A more difficult challenge is proving that companies are making hiring decisions based on race, said David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at New York University's School of Law."", 'Taking race into account for hiring or promotions is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A debate has emerged about whether companies are crossing the line by announcing goals for increasing Black and other minority representation. Companies say such efforts are not quotas but aspirational goals they will try to achieve through policies like widening candidate pools and rooting out bias in hiring processes.', 'Glasgow called it a “gray area” that could depend on a court’s interpretation of corporate policies. He said it could be hard to prove discrimination just because a company “announced in a really broad way that it would be nice to have more people of color in management” but plaintiffs could try to argue that Diversity Equity and Inclusion policies are pressuring hiring managers to make race-based decisions.', 'Conservative activists are trying to make just that case, seizing on corporate documents that share data on efforts to increase the ranks of Black, Hispanic and other underrepresented groups in their workforce, however modest that progress might be.', 'America First Legal, a group run by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent a letter in November to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeking an investigation into Macy’s efforts to strengthen its DEI policies, arguing they amount to discriminatory hiring practices.', 'In 2019, Macy’s announced a goal of 30% ethnic diversity among its leadership at the director level and above by 2025, in part to better serve its customer base, which is about 50% non-white. The retailer launched a leadership training program for selected managers of color, and last year required that candidates for director roles include ethnically diverse applicants. It also has incorporated its DEI goals into annual performance reviews for directors and company-wide incentive calculation.', 'America First Legal cited those initiatives to argue that Macy’s “has set explicit racial and other quotas for hiring.” The group has sent dozens of similar letters to the EEOC targeting companies from IBM to American Airlines.', ""Macy's declined to comment on the letter. But in a previous interview with The Associated Press, outgoing Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette said the company is sticking with its DEI policies while closely watching legal developments."", '“Our enthusiasm and our commitment to all the prongs that we had with DEI, and our strategy, remains. We might express it differently based on court rulings and in the future,” Gennette said, without providing details.']"

Founded more than two decades ago, the leader in digital payments has helped to spearhead the growth of cashless transactions. And it now has become an important part of how consumers and businesses do commerce.', ""It's smart to take the time to understand more about the company. That said, here are three things you need to know if you want to buy this fintech stock today."", 'Three key aspects of PayPal drive payment volume. Investors are likely most familiar with the branded checkout solution, which is what consumers use when they want to purchase something on their favorite websites. PayPal has become so ubiquitous, that at the end of 2022, it was accepted at nearly 80% of the top 1,500 retailers in North America and Europe, a huge lead versus the next best rival.', ""While growth for the branded checkout button has slowed, the unbranded checkout solution, known as Braintree, has posted rapid gains. This segment targets merchants, providing them with various services to securely and seamlessly accept payments. Braintree's total payment volume (TPV) soared 40% in 2022, representing 30% of PayPal's overall TPV at that time."", ""Because Braintree's margins are typically lower than branded checkout, the company's profitability will continue to be pressured as this division keeps outpacing overall growth.

Take fintech giant PayPal (PYPL), for instance. Over the past 12 months, the shares have shed 24% while the S&P 500 has recorded gains of 20%.', 'The drop has come as the company faces challenges in losing market share for its branded products, leading to a decline in both transaction percentage and transaction dollars.', 'That has left Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey “frustrated,” although the analyst remains in PayPal’s corner, despite conceding that many investors might need more convincing to get on board again. “We are long-term bulls, based on attractive risk/reward, but acknowledge that PYPL could remain relatively range bound until branded volume and transaction $ stabilize,” the 5-star analyst explained. “That said, we still believe that PayPal still occupies an important position in the eCommerce ecosystem. This creates what we consider an asymmetric risk/ reward in which modest monetization and/or share gains could cause a disproportionate positive re-rating.”', 'For 2024 and 2025, Jeffrey anticipates modest yet noticeable growth in branded volume and transaction dollars. The forecast is tied to the company’s initiatives aimed at transitioning from Braintree PSP (payment service provider) volume to branded solutions. That said, Jeffrey does admit that this is a “tenuous forecast” that relies solely on discussions with the company and anecdotal evidence that a more assertive Braintree pricing model and early efforts to enhance value-added services around its PSP offering could create a “more favorable backdrop.” “We still need more evidence that this strategy is bearing fruit, and we recognize that Braintree price concessions could have their own adverse transaction % repercussions,” the analyst went on to add.', 'Nevertheless, Jeffrey states several reasons to back the PayPal case, including the view that eCommerce is a “structural tailwind,” and that even in the face of “competitive challenges,” PayPal’s two-sided network offers “at least” as much value to merchants as other wallets, like Apple Pay, and PSPs, like Stripe and Adyen. Moreover, the company generates plenty of FCF, and boasts a robust balance sheet. Lastly, absent “material incremental fundamental deterioration,” the stock’s “undemanding” valuation suggests an “attractive risk/reward.”', 'As such, Jeffrey maintained a Buy rating on the shares and raised the price target from $65 to $73, implying investors will pocket returns of 20% a year from now. (To watch Jeffrey’s track record, click here)', 'Views on PayPal’s prospects are split evenly on Wall Street with 15 Buys and Holds, each, resulting in a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

If you want to skip our discussion on the airline industry, you can go directly to the 5 Safest Airlines in the World for 2024.', 'The global airline industry is an integral part of the global economy as it facilitates international trade and tourism. Currently, more than 5,000 airlines have over 23,000 aircraft, serving over 41,000 airports worldwide, as per the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Airlines are divided into three categories, namely traditional carriers, low-cost carriers, and cargo. Each category has its own target market and business model. Major players within the global airline industry include American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL).', 'According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the estimated revenue for the international airline industry in 2023 was $896 billion, with forecasted 2024 revenue being $964 billion. These figures translate into a year-on-year change of 21.7% and 7.6% for 2023 and 2024, respectively. The estimated profit margin for 2023 is 2.6%, while the 2024 forecasted profit margin for the airline industry is 2.7%. This profitability comes three years after the record net loss of approximately $140 billion in 2020 due to COVID-19. The main reason for a positive outlook in 2023 and 2024 is the resurgence of demand post-pandemic, resulting in a rise in both passenger and cargo transport. Except for Asia-Pacific, all regions are expected to reach or surpass pre-COVID levels in passenger traffic in 2024. However, as the pent-up demand from the pandemic decreases, the sharp growth in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) witnessed in 2022-2023 will also normalize in 2024. The airline industry is anticipated to experience a positive but relatively narrow profitability margin in 2024 due to normalized growth rates and rising expenses. However, this margin is notably slimmer compared to industries such as technology or oil and gas. The industry’s profitability is also quite vulnerable to uncertainties due to economic and geopolitical factors. These include high interest rates, the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East, supply-chain issues at aircraft manufacturers’ end, staff shortages, and the rising costs of compliance. The industry will have to navigate through the uncertainties caused by these factors for better financial health.', 'Alaska Airlines Incident Spurs Regulatory Action', 'The airline industry\'s safety standards have been called into question following a few recent incidents. On January 12, the US aviation regulator announced an indefinite extension of the grounding of Boeing Co\'s (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 9 airplanes. This decision was made to conduct additional safety checks following an incident involving Alaska Airlines on January 5, where a cabin panel blew off during a flight. The two major US carriers utilizing the affected aircraft, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, canceled many flights in the past week following the grounding. FAA Administrator Whitaker shared that he views the issues with the MAX 9 as a manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Highlighting a history of production challenges at Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), he commented, ""Whatever\'s happening isn\'t fixing the problem and requires an extensive review.""', ""Meanwhile, Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) expressed agreement with the decision of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground the 737 Max 9 planes for inspection. The grounding has affected approximately 171 aircraft. Boeing has taken steps to provide instructions to airlines on how to conduct inspections on these planes. Following the Alaska Airlines incident, a domestic flight operated by Japan's All Nippon Airways also had to return to its departure airport on January 14 after a crack was discovered on the cockpit window of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft while in midair. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares experienced a 2.2% decline in closing on Friday and have witnessed a nearly 12% drop since the incident on January 5. The company is already dealing with a financial crisis, having reported a net loss of $2.2 billion for the initial nine months of 2023.

According to Aviation Safety, 2023 has been the second safest year for airlines on record, with only five fatal crashes reported, resulting in 105 deaths.

In fact, management just provided preliminary fourth-quarter 2023 earnings, as well as a first look at expectations for 2024, and investors were pleased. Intuitive stock just hit fresh all-time highs, and rallied nearly 40% over the last 12-month stretch.', 'The company believes it has ample opportunities left to address critical issues in healthcare: improving patient care, and labor shortages due to an aging population. AI and robotics are getting increasing attention in the 2020s as solutions to these problems, putting Intuitive in prime position to benefit. But is the stock really a good buy for 2024, or is it all just hype?', 'Intuitive just reported preliminary results for Q4 2023, indicating that worldwide procedures performed with its da Vinci robotic surgery system increased 21% from 2022, and were up 22% for full-year 2023. In part, the stellar growth was due to lapping depressed results from the resurgence of COVID-19 in China at the end of last year.', 'Full-year 2023 revenue growth was pegged at 14% to $7.12 billion. The slower revenue trajectory was due to sluggish new da Vinci system placements -- 1,370 to be exact, up just 8% from new systems placed in 2022.', 'Additionally, to meet more hospital and surgery center needs due to a harder financing environment (as a result of higher interest rates), a greater portion of these system sales are being sold on an operating lease versus an outright sale. In 2023, 659 da Vinci systems were placed on lease terms (48% of the total), versus 38% placed on lease terms in 2022. A lease brings in less upfront revenue, so a higher mix tends to reduce revenue from selling a da Vinci system compared to years past.', 'At any rate, Intuitive thinks it will have another solid year in 2024, though the favorable comparables related to COVID lockdowns in China will be gone. At a recent investor event, management said about 2.2 million procedures were performed with Intuitive products in 2023. The guidance for worldwide da Vinci procedure growth is 13% to 16% in 2024, a solid initial indicator that Intuitive\'s gradual expansion will continue. This could be a great ""get rich slowly"" AI stock.', 'The general-purpose da Vinci Multiport robotic system has now been around for over two decades, but Intuitive is in the early innings of expanding its surgery platform with two new products: the Ion (for bronchoscopy, scoping of the lungs and airways) and the SP (or Single Port, used in narrow access applications).', 'The global installed base of systems is over 9,100, with the da Vinci Multiport at over 8,000. The da Vinci Multiport has slowed to a single-digit-percentage rate of growth. But just 530 Ion systems and 170 SPs leave plenty of wide open space for Intuitive to continue growing its installed base. Management has said it will also be focused on increasing installations in newer markets, like Japan, in 2024.', ""The company hinted at more innovation being developed behind the scenes, but Intuitive is about more than just selling robotic systems. It's a full-blown platform business these days, with a large catalog of training modules for surgeons learning to use da Vinci (including virtual reality to simulate using the machine)."", ""Pre- and post-surgery diagnostics using cloud-connected analytical data are also a growing outlet. And Intuitive has invested in 3D imaging to help surgeons plan a patient's procedure, like imaging of a tumor to help define boundaries of the surgery and how it will be removed before ever making an incision."", 'Of course, the ongoing worry with Intuitive stock is that its growth rate is slowing, and its shares trade for a premium. In fact, that premium price has been a nagging issue for years. As of this writing, the stock trades for just over 100 times trailing-12-month free cash flow and 86 times trailing-12-month generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings.', 'There are some past financial effects still weighing down profitability. The aforementioned skew toward more da Vinci leases have pressured profit margins. And years of investment into the Ion and SP systems have only just begun to trickle in as profitable returns. This shows up particularly in free-cash-flow generation, which has been flat over the last three-year stretch even as revenue has risen more than 50%. The expectation is thus that free cash flow and earnings can ratchet back up in the years ahead.', 'With Intuitive Surgical stock hitting fresh new all-time highs, the high price tag does look especially notable right now. Investors who have been eyeing this top healthcare technologist may want to wait for a pullback. But for those who want a quality healthcare play for the long haul, a small dollar-cost-average plan that builds a larger position in Intuitive over time can also work.', ""Either way, some prudence is in order as 2024 gets rolling. But don't overlook the performance of this long-standing pioneer in AI. Intuitive could be a big beneficiary of new healthcare technologies coming to bear in the decade to come."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intuitive Surgical wasn't one of them.

However, by the end of the year, updated forecasts suggested that copper prices would skyrocket in 2024, as the world faces deficits of the critical metal driven by more ambitious climate pledges from various countries around the globe. So, what can we expect for copper in the coming year?', 'In October, the ICSG predicted that the copper market would experience a major supply surplus in 2024, following a supply-demand balance last year. Production was expected to exceed usage by 467,000 metric tonnes in 2024, a significant increase from the 297,000 metric tonne surplus predicted for 2024 in April. However, the group made it clear that the forecast was based on the existing global project pipeline for supply and demand, which is rapidly changing as the green transition accelerates worldwide.', 'This updated forecast reflected a weak Western demand coupled with the strong Chinese copper output. By October, copper usage outside of China was expected to contract by one percent from the 2022 level “mainly impacted by declines in refined usage in EU countries and North America”, according to the ICSG. Meanwhile, China’s copper usage was expected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2023, based on the information the ICSG had available about the Chinese market. The growing demand in China has been driven by its power and electric vehicle sectors, which have remained strong despite a dip in manufacturing levels in 2023.', 'The ICSG\xa0stated, “An expected improvement in manufacturing activity, the ongoing energy transition and the development of new (semi-manufactured product) capacity in various countries should support higher growth in world refined usage in 2024.” Copper is viewed as a critical metal, vital for the construction of electric vehicles, power grids and wind turbines.', 'However, by the end of 2023, a report from the BMI Fitch Solutions research unit suggested that copper prices were expected to rise dramatically over the next two years owing to mining supply disruptions and higher demand. The report stated that it expects copper prices to rise by more than 75 percent over the next two years, driven by the acceleration of the global green transition. Prices could also be higher as the value of the dollar declines later in the year if the\xa0U.S. Federal Reserve cuts rates this year.', 'This updated prediction reflects several pledges made at the recent COP28 climate summit, where over 60 countries\xa0supported a plan to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Achieving this aim will require huge levels of copper to be produced in the coming years. In fact, higher renewable energy targets could push the global copper demand up by an additional 4.2 million tonnes by 2030. Based on this expectation, copper prices could rise to $15,000 a tonne in 2025, far higher than the previous\xa0record peak of $10,730 per tonne\xa0record last March.', 'Goldman Sachs has stated that it predicts a deficit of over half a million tonnes of copper in 2024 due to mining disruptions. In November,\xa0production was paused at the Cobre Panamá\xa0mine due to a Supreme Court ruling and widespread protests because of environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the copper producer Anglo American stated that it planned to\xa0reduce its output\xa0in 2024 and 2025 to cut costs. Goldman analysts\xa0wrote, “The supply cuts reinforce our view that the copper market is entering a period of much clearer tightening.” The group believes that copper prices could hit $10,000 a tonne by the end of 2024, before rising even higher the following year.', 'Emerging green energy markets are expected to benefit substantially from the rising demand for critical minerals and metals, including the South American countries Chile and Peru. Rising demand for copper is expected to spur greater investment in mining in the two countries, as well as drive export demand. Chile is home to around\xa021 percent of the world’s copper reserves. Chile is also experiencing high levels of success in its lithium industry, which is gaining greater international investment as demand rises. It forms part of the lithium triangle, alongside Argentina and Bolivia, which, together, hold\xa0more than 75 percent\xa0of the world’slithium supply.', 'Despite a less-than-optimistic forecast for the copper market earlier in 2023, several end-of-year outlooks predict a far higher global demand for copper between now and 2030, driving up copper prices. This rising demand could lead to copper deficits unless governments and private companies invest heavily in mining activities to ensure that the output meets demand in support of an accelerated green transition.', 'By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Trans-Afghan Railroad Fuels Surge in Regional Trade', 'Biden Launches New Initiative to Empower Youths in Green Transition', ""Argentina's Oil Revolution: Vaca Muerta Shale Fuels Economic Hope"", 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

It\'s also why the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks (the leading tech stocks) skyrocketed last year.', 'Despite the stock price boosts, few companies -- except for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- have seen a significant business impact from artificial intelligence over the past year.', ""It's natural to ask then if last year's AI-fueled stock-market surge is sustainable or if the AI boom is really just market hype."", ""One thing is clear. Last year's surge in tech stocks was primarily fueled by expectations that generative AI will be the next transformative technology. It's easy to see why investors are so excited about the trend. Tech luminaries like Bill Gates and Oracle's Larry Ellison have said as much, speculating that it could be as big as the internet."", 'While those expectations have yet to be reflected in the financial numbers of most companies, the chart below shows how those expectations led to increases in the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of most of the Magnificent Seven stocks over the past year.', ""As you can see, with the exception of Nvidia and Amazon, which both saw profits surge last year, the Magnificent Seven saw their earnings multiples expand, and four of the seven increased P/Es by double-digit percentages. That kind of multiple expansion isn't sustainable, and investors shouldn't expect the same kind of growth we saw in 2023 this year as share prices were beaten down after the 2022 bear market at the start of last year."", ""So will investors see an AI-related surge or an AI-related hangover next year? Let's take a look at the most likely scenario."", ""There's plenty of evidence that the disruptive potential of generative AI is real. There's a shortage of the chips, made by Nvidia, needed to run AI training models as comments from Oracle, OpenAI, and other AI leaders have made clear."", 'Tech companies are rapidly investing in AI technology, and Nvidia just announced a number of new partnerships in a wide range of industries, like healthcare, gaming, retail, and the auto industry.', 'However, some stocks have jumped from the boom in AI in what looks more like hype than deserved gains.', ""C3.ai (NYSE: AI), for example, was also a big winner last year, jumping 158%. However, that company has reported only modest growth in its business and wide losses despite management's hyping its opportunity in AI."", ""Following last year's boom in AI stocks, this year we're likely to see a bifurcation between genuine AI winners and pretenders like C3.ai. Investors are going to become more discerning and demanding of these stocks to bid them higher as valuations have increased."", ""We're also likely to see a normal progression through the hype cycle, meaning at some point we could see AI stocks fall broadly as investors become disillusioned with the technology."", ""However, that doesn't mean that the technology is only hype. The dot-com boom of 1995-2000, for example, yielded to a massive crash from 2001-2005, but the internet which emerged at that time was a very real disruptive technology. The disruption and the real impact on business just took longer to play out than many expected."", ""Nvidia has emerged as the biggest AI winner so far, and the semiconductor sector seems set to be the first to capitalize on the new technology. After all, these companies make the infrastructure required to run AI models, and other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom have given bullish forecasts for AI-related sales this year, though they're still well behind Nvidia. Foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing should also benefit from the trend as these components need to be manufactured."", ""In big tech, Microsoft and Alphabet are currently the companies that have made the most progress in turning the disruptive technology into a meaningful business, but there's still a lot more work to be done.

Microsoft's multibillion-dollar tie-up gives it the pole position for enjoying that growth and using it to benefit its other business segments. For example, Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, powers all OpenAI computing loads. It's not an obvious AI stock, but don't overlook its long-term AI opportunities."", 'Data might be the most essential ingredient of AI technology outside of computing power. However, data often comes from multiple sources and can be disorganized and hard to use. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse platform that securely stores, analyzes, and shares data. That makes it a potentially crucial role player for companies using AI.', ""Snowflake's rapid growth backs that up.

While use cases for AI continue to explode, one company in particular is front and center in the action."", ""Semiconductor giant Nvidia produces some of the most cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) on the market -- chips that are used to train and power generative AI models. The demand for these chips is so high that Nvidia's business sets new records every quarter."", 'The company\'s impressive results propelled Nvidia\'s market cap past the $1 trillion mark, earning it entry into an exclusive club whose only other current members are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Nvidia\'s leadership position within the semiconductor industry led Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives to dub its CEO the ""Godfather of AI.""', 'The momentum from last year has thus far continued into 2024: Nvidia stock hit a new all-time high on Jan. 8.', 'But while investors broadly continue to be enamored with Nvidia, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood just scooped up shares of a different semiconductor business. On the same day Nvidia touched that new peak, Wood added a total of roughly 58,000 shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to two of her exchange-traded funds (ETFs).', ""Let's consider why she may have done that, and assess whether the stock deserves a position in your portfolio."", 'A common theme in investing is trying to identify ""the next big thing."" But in their attempts to peer into the future, investors can sometimes convince themselves that they have found a diamond in the rough and draw conclusions that aren\'t really based on any fundamental analysis.', ""So while it's fun to speculate that Wood might view Qualcomm as the next big tech stock to break out, there is likely much more detail to the equation."", ""Instead of assuming that Wood believes Qualcomm has the same potential as Nvidia, let's break down some known parameters."", ""First, Wood is a big believer in emerging technologies. Her ETFs are invested in growth spaces ranging from autonomous driving, genomics, crypto, streaming, gaming, telemedicine, and e-commerce. Given this dynamic, it's not surprising that she would allocate a portion of her portfolio to AI -- and the semiconductor industry plays a key role in the artificial intelligence movement. Statista predicts that revenue from AI chips will grow from $53 billion in 2023 to $119 billion by 2027."", 'This large and expanding market makes it highly likely that multiple companies will emerge as major players. For this reason, Wood might see Qualcomm as an overlooked opportunity in the AI semiconductor space, which is currently dominated by Nvidia and its top rival, Advanced Micro Devices.', ""But before jumping to any conclusions, it's important to understand Qualcomm's position relative to Wood's other holdings. Right now, Qualcomm stock only accounts for 0.06% of Ark Invest's overall portfolio. By contrast, Nvidia accounts for 0.50%, while AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor comprise 0.30% and 0.17%, respectively."", ""While it's clear that Wood is diversifying Ark's exposure among chip manufacturers, and the entire semiconductor sector makes up a relatively small part of the ETF's holdings."", ""In my view, Wood's purchase of Qualcomm was merely a hedge. The number of different stocks she owns within the semiconductor industry may shed some light on her stance toward the overall market. As such, I think she is slowly building positions in the biggest brands the sector has to offer."", ""Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15, Qualcomm stock looks dirt cheap relative to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Moreover, given the S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.7, it could be that investors in general do not expect Qualcomm to be an overperformer relative to the broader market."", ""While this may appear as an opportunity to pick up shares at a relative bargain price, investors should keep in mind that Qualcomm hasn't been without its challenges. The company has struggled to grow its revenues for several quarters, and operating losses have been piling up. The company recently resorted to layoffs in an effort to curb concerns over its growth prospects."", ""I see Qualcomm as a turnaround story. While the company doesn't carry the same allure as its cohorts, management is making some strategic moves to ensure it is well-positioned to benefit from the themes fueling AI. Although I think the stock deserves to trade at a discounted valuation relative to its peers, it could be a reasonable buy at this price."", 'It was interesting to see Wood scoop up Qualcomm on shares the same day Nvidia hit an all-time high -- but that alone is no reason for you to buy this stock. In fact, the intriguing timing was probably just a coincidence.', ""If you're looking to invest in AI, semiconductor stocks are a good place to start. And while Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and others are currently perceived as leaders, Qualcomm could very well emerge as a long-term winner as it marches back toward accelerated growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of them.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow."", ""Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' See our latest analysis for McKesson ', ""We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$3.85b', 'US$4.34b', 'US$4.74b', 'US$4.66b', 'US$5.07b', 'US$5.26b', 'US$5.43b', 'US$5.59b', 'US$5.75b', 'US$5.89b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 3.77%', 'Est @ 3.30%', 'Est @ 2.98%', 'Est @ 2.75%', 'Est @ 2.59%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.9k', 'US$4.0k', 'US$3.7k', 'US$3.7k', 'US$3.7k', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.5k', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.2k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$151b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$151b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$82b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$118b.

Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McKesson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Answer these, and the future is wide open.', 'The equity analysis team at Morgan Stanley has taken up this challenge, and come down with an interesting answer. Looking at the Machinery and Construction segment, firm analyst Angel Castillo tells investors that there are attractive opportunities going past the non-residential construction sector, and has tagged some old-school stock picks as potential gainers for the young year; namely, industrial stocks.', 'Castillo advises investors to look into heavy machinery and industrial transportation, writing, “We see ample high conviction investment ideas within Machinery, despite our outlook of a peaking US Non-Resi cycle and uncertain macro… We expect the largest Machinery end-market of US Non-Resi to peak in 2024/25. That is likely to be compounded near-term by macro and political uncertainty, resulting in negative earnings revisions across a lot of our coverage. While the impact of this cannot be ignored, we would advise against generalizing it to the entire group. Said another way, we see attractive risk-rewards across various other end-markets that we think may be troughing (i.e., Trucks, Locomotives, etc.).”', 'Castillo doesn’t just analyze the sector generally, but he also provides a specific recommendation of two stocks that investors should consider. Do other analysts agree with Castillo? We’ve used the TipRanks database to find out.', 'Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)', 'First on our MS-backed list is Martin Marietta Materials, a long-time stalwart of the American industrial scene. The company traces its roots back to 1939, as an aggregates company, and over the years it merged with both the Martin and Lockheed aircraft companies. Martin Marietta Materials spun off from Lockheed in 1996, and has since operated as an independent company focused on its original roots: the production of aggregates and heavy construction materials.', 'Martin Marietta Materials has found success as a commercial company producing vital construction materials. The company was added to the S&P 500 index in 2014, and has facilities located across 28 states. The company’s presence is particularly strong in the Southeast, the upper Ohio and Mississippi valley regions, East Texas, and California. Martin Marietta’s product lines include engineered aggregate materials of sand, gravel, and crushed stone; cements and cement treated materials; ready mix concrete; asphalt paving materials; and magnesia chemicals and lime.', 'When we zoom into MLM’s financial results, we find a company whose last quarterly release showed earnings above expectations and revenue that was up year-over-year. For 3Q23, the company’s top line of $1.99 billion in revenue was up 9.9% yet missed the estimates, albeit by just $10 million. At the bottom line, MLM’s GAAP earnings per share came to $6.94, or 92 cents per share ahead of expectations.', 'For Castillo, writing the Morgan Stanley review on this stock, this presents an easy choice – MLM is a stock to buy, based on its sound foundation in an essential industry, and clear potential for further profitability and share growth. Castillo says of the company, “MLM is our preferred way to play the construction theme for a number of reasons, including: i) pricing power allowing the company to grow earnings profitably even if non-resi spending weakens; ii) greater overlap to Mega Projects compared to peers; iii) leverage to a troughing Residential cycle; iv) BS strength and a highly fragmented industry offer ample inorganic growth opportunity; and v) re-rating opportunity as shares continue to trade at a discount to peer VMC.”', 'Quantifying his stance, the analyst gives the shares an Overweight (Buy) rating, with a $595 price target that implies a 20% gain on the one-year horizon. (To watch Castillo’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, MLM gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analysts, based on 12 recent reviews that include 11 to Buy against just 1 to Hold. The shares are trading for $495.88 and their $550.80 average target price points toward a one-year upside potential of 11%. (See MLM stock forecast)', 'Cummins, Inc. (CMI)', 'No heavy industry can work without power, and power is the specialty of the next stock on our list. Cummins is well-known as a maker of top-end, heavy duty engines and powerplants for industrial plant and large vehicle use. The company bills itself as a ‘global power leader,’ and its product lines include diesel engines for large trucks and construction equipment; generators and other power systems for home, RV, commercial, and industrial use; ancillary engine components; and new power technologies such as batteries and electrolyzers for hydrogen fuel systems, under the Accelera name.', 'While this may sound like a niche business, there’s really a pretty good chance that the average investor has been in a vehicle powered by a Cummins engine. The company’s marketing targets include the heavy- and medium-duty truck segments, municipal busses, recreational vehicles – and Cummins has engines suitable for lighter duty automotive uses, too. On the more industrial side, Cummins engines and power generators have found wide use in the construction, mining, railroad, and marine industries, and in numerous types of military equipment.', 'Cummins has been in business since 1919, and since then has expanded into a global powerhouse. The company’s network includes thousands of dealer locations, parts suppliers and distributors, and dedicated service and repair centers. The company\xa0 employs over 73,000 people worldwide, and in the last full year reported, 2022, Cummins had total sales of $28.1 billion, giving net earnings of $2.2 billion.', 'In the company’s last earnings release, for 3Q23, Cummins had $8.4 billion in total revenue. This was up 15% year-over-year and came in $250 million ahead of the forecast. At the bottom line, Cummins reported a non-GAAP EPS of $4.74, 5 cents better than had been anticipated. Cummins’ net cash from operations in Q3 reached a company quarterly record of $1.5 billion.', 'All of this presents a sound picture of an industrial firm with a solid foundation and a good reputation – and that’s the background to Castillo’s comments on the stock. Laying out his bullish thesis, he writes, “More modest than expected downturn in HD trucks in the US, solid growth in MD, and strong execution of Accelera growth strategy result in better than expected sales and margins, driving positive earnings revisions. More importantly, a rebound in US Class 8 orders shifts investor focus to a stronger 2025/26, driving shares higher.”', 'Putting this into quantifiable terms, Castillo rates the shares as Overweight (Buy), and he sets a $278 price target that suggests a 17% one-year upside potential.', 'Castillo represents the bulls on this stock, but Wall Street is not quite ready to join him. The shares have a Hold consensus rating, based on 9 recent reviews with 3-5-1 breakdown to Buy-Hold-Sell. The stock is trading for $237.15, and its $257.50 average target price implies an 8.5% increase over the one-year time frame.

If they don't want to see ads, Amazon will offer the chance to upgrade Prime subscriptions to an ad-free tier for $2.99 per month."", ""The move follows similar ad-tier introductions from Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Both said they've seen a lot of success with their ad-supported tiers, and Bank of America analyst Justin Post thinks Amazon can see comparable benefits. He estimates the change will add $4.8 billion in revenue for Amazon between the higher-priced tier and additional ad revenue. And since the marginal cost of introducing ads to Prime Video is minimal, almost all of that will flow to Amazon's bottom line."", ""Here's what investors can expect when Amazon introduces ads in Prime Video."", 'The big media companies have been making their ad-supported tiers more and more attractive to consumers over the last year.', ""Amazon is following the same pricing strategy Disney adopted when it introduced its ad-supported tier for Disney+ in 2022. If subscribers didn't want to pay an extra $3 per month, they could pay the same price they had been and sit through a few ads. Last year, Disney raised prices again, but only on the ad-free versions of its streaming services."", 'Netflix introduced a low-priced ad-supported version of its service in late 2022. Subsequently, it removed the ability to sign up for its basic ad-free plan and raised the price on ad-supported plan\xa0for existing subscribers.', 'The move points to a clear preference for streaming services to push consumers to their ad-supported tier.

That could result in a huge new audience for advertisers when the company flips the switch on the ad tier.

They'll accept the ads in exchange for not having to pay anything more per month for Prime (or go through the hassle of changing their subscription). The other 30% -- 45 million people -- will pay the extra $2.99 per month."", 'Importantly, the cost for Amazon to implement the new ad-supported tier is minimal. Amazon already has a massive advertising business that brought in more than $43 billion over the previous 12 months through the third quarter of last year. It also already has limited advertising in Prime Video during its sports broadcasts like Thursday Night Football. In other words, all the infrastructure is in place for the company to sell and deliver a lot of advertising for Prime Video.', ""So practically all of that additional revenue will flow to Amazon's operating income. Post points out that should further boost Amazon's operating margin, which is already approaching recent highs. He believes the Prime video changes could add another 50 basis points to Amazon's North American operating margin."", ""Amazon's stock climbed higher in 2023 on the back of beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in each of the first three quarters of the year.

Not accounting for inflation, that’s more than the $24.4 million the first movie made in its opening weekend.', 'The “Mean Girls” competition over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend featured several new releases, including the Jason Statham action movie “ The Beekeeper "" and the Jay-Z produced biblical satire “The Book of Clarence,"" in addition to a slew of awards contenders capitalizing on buzz from recent nominations and the Golden Globes.', 'As with “Barbie,” another enthusiastically pink movie, female audiences made up the vast majority (76%) of opening weekend ticket buyers for “Mean Girls.” According to exit polls, 70% were between the ages of 18 and 34, which, yes, means that it had appeal for audiences who hadn’t been born when Regina George was first introduced to the world.', '“The property is iconic,” said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s president of domestic distribution. “Tina Fey is legendary and her contemporary twist has resonated with audiences, particularly the female audience.”', 'This iteration of “Mean Girls” stars Angourie Rice, Auli’i Cravalho and Reneé Rapp, who played Regina on stage. It was originally planned to go straight to streaming on Paramount+, but the studio pivoted after test scores were positive. Social media played a big part in getting the word out and “Mean Girls” also inspired groups of friends to go to the movies together. An estimated 40% went with two or more friends.', 'Fey returned to write and co-star in the new film, which was directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. and cost a reported $36 million to produce. Reviews have been more positive than not, with a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences gave it a B CinemaScore which may not bode especially well for word-of-mouth appeal. Recent musicals like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” scored in the A-range. The studio is optimistic after this weekend though. It also made $6.5 million from 16 international markets.', '“It’s no secret that the release calendar is a little light for the first couple months of the year and because of the reception to this film we stand a chance of broadening this audience,” Aronson said. “It really is a crowd-pleaser.”', 'Amazon and MGM’s “The Beekeeper"" debuted in second place with an estimated $16.8 million from 3,303 theaters. Men made up approximately 62% of ticket buyers and audiences overall gave it a B+ CinemaScore. By the end of the four-day weekend, the studio expects it to have made $19.1 million. Miramax handled the international distribution for “The Beekeper,” which also grossed $20.4 million from 49 territories.', 'Third place went to “Wonka,” which added $8.4 million in its fifth weekend. The Timothée Chalamet-led musical has now made over $178 million domestically and $500 million globally.', '“Musicals are on a roll,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It seems like a lot of studios run away from putting musical on their films for fear of limiting their audience pool, but I think this is a genre Hollywood should embrace and highlight.”', 'The Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy “Anyone But You,” a Sony release, is turning into a bit of a sleeper success as well, making nearly $7 million in its fourth weekend. By Monday, its domestic total should be around $56.5 million. Universal and Illumination’s “Migration” rounded out the top five with $6.2 million in its fourth weekend.', 'Not everything landed this weekend, though. “ The Book of Clarence,” a faith-based comedy/drama with a starry, ensemble cast including LaKeith Stanfield, Omar Sy, RJ Cyler, David Oyelowo, Alfre Woodard and Teyana Taylor is not off to a promising start. The Legendary Pictures release opened to an estimated $2.6 million from just over 2,000 locations.', 'Written and directed by the British singer-songwriter Jeymes Samuel (stage name The Bullitts), it was self-consciously styled after Golden Age biblical epics like “The Ten Commandments.” It has also gotten mixed reviews, with 68% on Rotten Tomatoes and a B CinemaScore.', 'The Walt Disney Co. sent its 2020 Pixar film “Soul” to movie theaters this weekend as well, where it made $429,000 from 1350 locations in North America. It\'s the first of several Pixar movies, including “Luca"" and “Turning Red,” that Disney is bringing to theaters this winter after all had streaming-only releases on Disney+ during the pandemic.', ""Hollywood's awards season is also in full swing, and though many top contenders are already available to watch at home, some are still rolling out in theaters and hoping to capitalize on new nominations and awards shows like last weekend's Golden Globes. “Poor Things,” which was a big winner, added $1.8 million from only 580 theaters. “All of Us Strangers” took in $474,000 from 120 screens. “American Fiction” expanded nationwide and made $1.9 million from 625 screens. “The Zone of Interest,” playing on 25 screens, also crossed $1 million."", 'Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday.', '1. “Mean Girls,” $28 million.', '2. “The Beekeeper,” $16.8 million.', '3. “Wonka,” $8.4 million.', '4. “Anyone But You,” $6.9 million.', '5. “Migration,” $6.2 million.', '6. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” $5.3 million.', '7. “Night Swim,” $4.7 million.', '8. “The Boys in the Boat,” $3.5 million.', '9. “The Book of Clarence,”$2.6 million.', '10. “The Iron Claw,” $2.4 million.']"

Stay with me for a second. As you may know from the film series, “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” the protagonists of this horror franchise cannot afford to fall asleep. I’m not going to get into it here but bad things happen if they snooze.', 'And it’s the same principle with these sleeper stocks. Sure, they look ugly and perhaps downright irrelevant on the surface. And even I’ve been critical of these ideas in the past. Still, if you ignore them, they can cost you. Not in the macabre, wrong-end-of-a-fillet type of deal but rather in absorbing an opportunity cost.', 'In other words, when people say past performance is no predictor of the future, that also applies to previously underwhelming enterprises. On that note, below are sleeper stocks to consider in 2024.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com', 'On the surface, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) might not seem like one of the sleeper stocks. Rather, the investment narrative went to sleep and for apparently justifiable reasons. The shame of it was that HAS was soaring higher to September of last year. Since then, however, HAS began tumbling. In late October, Hasbro and its main rival got beat up due to consumers cutting back on spending.', 'However, the most recent jobs report indicates that the economy continues to be surprisingly resilient. Therefore, the Federal Reserve has hopes for engineering what previously seemed a long-shot soft landing. If so, the personal saving rate – which increased from November 2022 to November 2023 – may soften this year. If that materializes, Hasbro could start a comeback effort.', 'Also, what could surprise the bears is the volume of sold calls in the options market. Specifically, Fintel’s screener for options flow – which exclusively targets big block transactions likely made by institutions – reveals what are effectively short “obligatory” positions in the derivatives market.', 'If the bulls wish to squeeze out the bears, HAS could start flying. Therefore, it’s one of the sleeper stocks to pay attention to.', 'Source: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com', 'For quite some time, I must admit that I wasn’t a fan of dating app Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL). Yeah, I get how seemingly everybody loved the new social relationship platform. As well, many praised the ethos of the company. Basically, for users in traditional relationships, women make the first move. Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd explained that this framework facilitates gender equity in relationships.', 'May I say the quiet part out loud? It also unnecessarily frustrates half the user base. Let’s face it – there can only be so much social equity demands you can force on male users before they walk over to another competing platform. Unsurprisingly – at least in my opinion – BMBL cratered.', 'However, the brand is fresh and relevant so there’s hope for a comeback here. As you might imagine, some folks have had enough, selling BMBL call options. And some of these transactions are big block trades that are yet to expire. That could create a feedback loop benefiting contrarian bulls if BMBL starts moving higher.', 'I believe this is a situation where the pessimists could find themselves exposed. For that, it’s one of the sleeper stocks to put on your radar.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Fundamentally, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) is, at least for me, the most controversial idea on this list of sleeper stocks. Last month, I stated that it’s one of the overvalued tech plays and that you should probably avoid it. Frankly, Peloton is a tough pill to swallow. It suffered a product recall due to an injury-causing defect. As well, insiders began selling a significant number of shares.', 'If that wasn’t worrying enough, the declining revenue growth trend made its lowly sales multiple legitimately appear a value trap. However, I also mentioned in that InvestorPlace article that the upside risk factor centered on big block sold calls. Following publication, a major trade (or traders) sold 1,456 contracts of the Feb 16 ’24 4.00 Call. For underwriting the risk, the bear(s) collected a premium of $366,250.', 'Now, let’s think about this. You’re going to bet that PTON stock won’t materially rise above $4 when the transaction occurred deep in the money (ITM) at $6.42? This is the equivalent of a poker game when someone goes all-in.', 'Are they bluffing? I don’t know but that’s a massive risk that I certainly wouldn’t take.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The S&P 500 rose 24% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 43%. But there was a caveat to these gains. Though many stocks moved higher by the end of 2023, some stocks' gains were easily eclipsed by monstrous returns seen in tech. Indeed, much of the market's rally last year was driven by explosive growth in top tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla."", ""One stock epitomizing the types of companies that underperformed last year (many were established dividend stocks in boring industries) was McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). The fast-food chain's shares rose 12.5%, with a gain of 15% when including dividends. This significantly lagged the S&P 500's 24% gain."", 'After underperforming so dramatically, is it time to scoop up shares of this dividend stock? After all, market interest sometimes shifts toward out-of-favor sectors. Perhaps 2024 is the year that strong dividend stocks will shine.', ""Interestingly, the McDonald's growth story seems as intact as ever. In its most recent quarter, revenue rose 14% year over year, or 11% in constant currency. Operating income jumped 16%, or 13% in constant currency. Topping it all off, earnings per share increased 18%, or 15% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. A nearly 9% year-over-year increase in comparable store sales was key to this momentum."", ""Looking ahead, analysts expect slower yet still strong growth in earnings per share from McDonald's. The consensus forecast calls for annual earnings per share of nearly 9% over the next five years. Not bad for an old and mature company many people might wrongly assume is no longer growing."", ""One of the great things about McDonald's stock is that it's rewarded shareholders handsomely over the long haul through both share price appreciation and dividends. In fact, the company's tenured dividend history is a testament to the durability and growth engine behind the fast food chain's model. The company has paid dividends to shareholders since 1976, raising its payout every year for 47 years straight."", ""Today, the dividend yield sits at 2.3%. Yet the company pays out only about 53% of its earnings in dividends. So there's probably more growth to come."", ""But the McDonald's dividend isn't the whole story regarding how the company rewards shareholders with its excess cash. It also returns cash to shareholders indirectly through share repurchases. Indeed, management estimates that from the end of 2019 through 2023 it returned a total of about $25 billion to shareholders when you combine dividends and repurchases -- a meaningful sum for a company with a market capitalization of about $213 billion today."", ""So, is McDonald's stock a buy today, after underperforming the market last year? It depends. If you're looking for a stock likely to outperform the market over the long haul, it may not be a good bet. But if you're looking for solid long-term returns, dividend income, and lower volatility than the overall market, it is likely a good investment choice."", ""Overall, the risk-reward profile of McDonald's stock is attractive. Sure, shares aren't cheap at 26 times earnings. But they aren't expensive either."", ""Should you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?"", ""Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and McDonald's wasn't one of them.

', 'In fact, investors commonly own dividend stocks not for the income they can get, but because, if they find a dividend stock that’s undervalued, they can double dip with market-beating capital gains to go along with a juicy dividend. ', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'If that sounds like an attractive combination to you, here are three dividend stocks that may present you with a solid buying opportunity in January 2024. ', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi', 'Some investors may challenge the inclusion of Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) on a list of dividend stocks to buy. They may point to the LLY stock dividend yield, which is just 0.73% as of January 5, 2024. However, this is a time when there are other factors to consider. ', 'For example, the company has increased its dividend by over 15% in each of the last three years with its most recent increase happening in the last quarter. Also, Lilly pays out an annual per share dividend of $4.52. ', 'But the real upside for Eli Lilly comes from projected earnings. In the next 12 months, the company expects to see earnings grow by 89%. Much of this is due to the success of its GLP-1 weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. ', 'These drugs were a big reason for the company’s significant revenue gains in the last two quarters. In that time, LLY stock climbed 36%. This may lead to concerns that the growth in the stock is already priced in. ', 'To support that conclusion, the company’s stock has been finding a firm level of resistance at its current price around $618. However, on December 19, 2023, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reiterated its Overweight rating on the stock while increasing its price target to $822. ', 'Investors will get updated guidance when Lilly reports earnings on February 6. ', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'The buying thesis for United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is that stocks that underperform the market one year frequently outperform the market the following year. United Parcel Service was at the tip of the spear as consumers and businesses cut discretionary spending from their budgets. It also lost some business during its labor dispute. Not surprisingly, the company’s revenue and earnings are drifting towards pre-pandemic levels, as is the UPS stock price.', 'The stock is not likely to get much of a boost from the holiday season, and that could mean the stock may drift lower. However, the wild card for investors to consider is the direction of interest rates. If rates are cut, and particularly if they’re cut sharply, demand is likely to return. ', 'That would raise the company’s earnings outlook, which currently calls for about 6% growth in the next 12 months. And while you wait on that growth, you get an attractive dividend that yields 4.08%, has grown an average of 17% over the last three years, and has increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years. ', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'If you feel the first two picks on this list of dividend stocks to buy are not ready for your investment dollars right now, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) may be more of what you’re looking for. The company is a midstream oil company that operates the largest networks of pipelines and terminals in the United States.', 'Oil prices have been under pressure on lower demand. And KMI stock is down over 3% in the last 12 months. However, oil prices are trending higher in the first week of 2024. And if the consensus opinion is correct, and the Federal Reserve does lower interest rates, demand for oil will rise, which will be bullish for pipeline companies.', 'This seems to be supported by institutional investors. I point you to an article written by Josh Enomoto in December. In that article, Enomoto notes that there’s an unusual number of these investors buying far out-the-money (OTM) calls. That would imply these investors see a strong upside for KMI stock.

Since he took the helm in 1965, the shares have enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 19.8% through 2022, doubling the benchmark S&P 500's 9.9% result."", ""With those market-crushing returns, it's always worthwhile to look at Berkshire's $360 billion stock portfolio to see which shares the company holds and determine whether any of them might help your portfolio beat the market. So, on that theme, here are two no-brainer Warren Buffett stocks to consider buying right now."", ""With a stake worth $28.6 billion, American Express (NYSE: AXP) represents 8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, making the global payments company its third-largest position. Berkshire first acquired American Express stock in 1991 and completed its $1.3 billion purchase in 1995; it has not bought or sold any shares since."", 'American Express is a longtime dividend-paying stock, first issuing its payout in 1989 and consistently increasing it through the years since. Today, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share, representing an annual yield of 1.3%.', ""Beyond its total return over the past few decades, American Express excels in one metric Buffett consistently favors: retained earnings. The calculation measures a company's net income or losses and subtracts the total dividends paid."", 'Management can then use the retained earnings to do any of the following: expand the business, make acquisitions, pay down debt, or repurchase stock.', 'Over the trailing 12 months, American Express generated $8 billion in net income and paid its shareholders $1.7 billion in dividends, retaining $6.3 billion. With this surplus, it acquired Nipendo, an Israel-based payments company, for an undisclosed amount and repurchased 2% of its own shares.', ""Over the past three years, management has smartly reduced its net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) by 91%, from $16.9 billion to $1.4 billion. As a result, it won't be saddled with paying high-interest expenses or relying on expensive debt while interest rates are at elevated levels."", ""One concern with American Express is that its total provision for credit losses (an expense set aside to allow for uncollected loans and loan payments) is rising as some consumers and commercial clients struggle with higher inflation and interest rates. Specifically, that key performance indicator was at $1.2 billion during the third quarter of 2023, up 58% year over year. Management doesn't seem too concerned, noting how its net write-off and delinquency rates are below pre-pandemic levels, but it's something shareholders should watch closely in the year ahead."", ""Lastly, regarding valuation, American Express looks like a cheap stock. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.4, significantly lower than competitors Mastercard and Visa at 29.7 and 26.6, respectively. When you consider Amex has nearly tripled the total return of those two over the past three years, the stock looks cheap and is worthy of investors' attention."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is Berkshire's longest-held stock and one that Warren Buffett has declared he would never think of selling -- even one share. The beverage maker, founded in 1892, holds elite status as a Dividend King, being an S&P 500 component that has paid and raised its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years."", 'Coca-Cola recently paid $0.46 per share for its fourth consecutive quarter, meaning shareholders should reasonably expect management to soon raise it for the 62nd consecutive year. As it stands, the current annual yield is 3.1%.', 'Beyond the iconic brand and dividend history, sales are on the rise again after taking a dip during the pandemic. Digging into the numbers, net operating revenue bottomed out in 2020 at $33 billion after generating $37 billion in 2019.', 'More recently, Coca-Cola generated $43 billion in 2022, and management guided for 2023 organic revenue (excluding currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions, divestitures, and structural changes) to grow 10% to 11%.', ""Notably, Coca-Cola has yet to return to its revenue's high-water mark of $48 billion in 2012, which brings us to one of its main risks: consumers' health habits. According to research by independent evaluator Keybridge, calories consumed from soda per person declined 11.8% from 2014 to 2020."", 'The good news is that the total beverage volume steadily increased by 8.9% from 2014 to 2020, meaning consumers still like buying drinks. As a result, Coca-Cola management has diversified its offerings over the past decade, acquiring the sparkling water Topo Chico for $220 million in 2017 and the sports drink BodyArmor for $5.6 billion in 2021.', 'Coca-Cola stock currently looks undervalued. It trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21.4, significantly below its five-year trailing average of 27.4.', ""When looking for a new stock to buy, it's easier to overlook some of the best companies in the world in favor of stocks with a lot of hype behind them. These two companies have a long history in the public markets and have consistently delivered solid returns for long-term shareholders, particularly with dividends and share repurchases."", ""To illustrate, in Warren Buffett's most recent shareholder letter, he wrote how, despite Berkshire not adding to its position in Coca-Cola since 1994, its dividends received grew from $75 million in 1994 to $704 million in 2022."", ""Similarly, Berkshire hasn't added to its position in American Express since 1995, and its dividends received grew from $41 million to $302 million in 2022. It's important to note that Berkshire's ownership stake has also increased significantly in both stocks due to share repurchases over the years."", ""For today's prospective buyers, both of these businesses trade at fair valuations and are established market leaders, making them worthy additions to a portfolio, especially for investors seeking dividends."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Answer these, and the future is wide open.', 'The equity analysis team at Morgan Stanley has taken up this challenge, and come down with an interesting answer. Looking at the Machinery and Construction segment, firm analyst Angel Castillo tells investors that there are attractive opportunities going past the non-residential construction sector, and has tagged some old-school stock picks as potential gainers for the young year; namely, industrial stocks.', 'Castillo advises investors to look into heavy machinery and industrial transportation, writing, “We see ample high conviction investment ideas within Machinery, despite our outlook of a peaking US Non-Resi cycle and uncertain macro… We expect the largest Machinery end-market of US Non-Resi to peak in 2024/25. That is likely to be compounded near-term by macro and political uncertainty, resulting in negative earnings revisions across a lot of our coverage. While the impact of this cannot be ignored, we would advise against generalizing it to the entire group. Said another way, we see attractive risk-rewards across various other end-markets that we think may be troughing (i.e., Trucks, Locomotives, etc.).”', 'Castillo doesn’t just analyze the sector generally, but he also provides a specific recommendation of two stocks that investors should consider. Do other analysts agree with Castillo? We’ve used the TipRanks database to find out.', 'Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)', 'First on our MS-backed list is Martin Marietta Materials, a long-time stalwart of the American industrial scene. The company traces its roots back to 1939, as an aggregates company, and over the years it merged with both the Martin and Lockheed aircraft companies. Martin Marietta Materials spun off from Lockheed in 1996, and has since operated as an independent company focused on its original roots: the production of aggregates and heavy construction materials.', 'Martin Marietta Materials has found success as a commercial company producing vital construction materials. The company was added to the S&P 500 index in 2014, and has facilities located across 28 states. The company’s presence is particularly strong in the Southeast, the upper Ohio and Mississippi valley regions, East Texas, and California. Martin Marietta’s product lines include engineered aggregate materials of sand, gravel, and crushed stone; cements and cement treated materials; ready mix concrete; asphalt paving materials; and magnesia chemicals and lime.', 'When we zoom into MLM’s financial results, we find a company whose last quarterly release showed earnings above expectations and revenue that was up year-over-year. For 3Q23, the company’s top line of $1.99 billion in revenue was up 9.9% yet missed the estimates, albeit by just $10 million. At the bottom line, MLM’s GAAP earnings per share came to $6.94, or 92 cents per share ahead of expectations.', 'For Castillo, writing the Morgan Stanley review on this stock, this presents an easy choice – MLM is a stock to buy, based on its sound foundation in an essential industry, and clear potential for further profitability and share growth. Castillo says of the company, “MLM is our preferred way to play the construction theme for a number of reasons, including: i) pricing power allowing the company to grow earnings profitably even if non-resi spending weakens; ii) greater overlap to Mega Projects compared to peers; iii) leverage to a troughing Residential cycle; iv) BS strength and a highly fragmented industry offer ample inorganic growth opportunity; and v) re-rating opportunity as shares continue to trade at a discount to peer VMC.”', 'Quantifying his stance, the analyst gives the shares an Overweight (Buy) rating, with a $595 price target that implies a 20% gain on the one-year horizon. (To watch Castillo’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, MLM gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analysts, based on 12 recent reviews that include 11 to Buy against just 1 to Hold. The shares are trading for $495.88 and their $550.80 average target price points toward a one-year upside potential of 11%. (See MLM stock forecast)', 'Cummins, Inc. (CMI)', 'No heavy industry can work without power, and power is the specialty of the next stock on our list. Cummins is well-known as a maker of top-end, heavy duty engines and powerplants for industrial plant and large vehicle use. The company bills itself as a ‘global power leader,’ and its product lines include diesel engines for large trucks and construction equipment; generators and other power systems for home, RV, commercial, and industrial use; ancillary engine components; and new power technologies such as batteries and electrolyzers for hydrogen fuel systems, under the Accelera name.', 'While this may sound like a niche business, there’s really a pretty good chance that the average investor has been in a vehicle powered by a Cummins engine. The company’s marketing targets include the heavy- and medium-duty truck segments, municipal busses, recreational vehicles – and Cummins has engines suitable for lighter duty automotive uses, too. On the more industrial side, Cummins engines and power generators have found wide use in the construction, mining, railroad, and marine industries, and in numerous types of military equipment.', 'Cummins has been in business since 1919, and since then has expanded into a global powerhouse. The company’s network includes thousands of dealer locations, parts suppliers and distributors, and dedicated service and repair centers. The company\xa0 employs over 73,000 people worldwide, and in the last full year reported, 2022, Cummins had total sales of $28.1 billion, giving net earnings of $2.2 billion.', 'In the company’s last earnings release, for 3Q23, Cummins had $8.4 billion in total revenue. This was up 15% year-over-year and came in $250 million ahead of the forecast. At the bottom line, Cummins reported a non-GAAP EPS of $4.74, 5 cents better than had been anticipated. Cummins’ net cash from operations in Q3 reached a company quarterly record of $1.5 billion.', 'All of this presents a sound picture of an industrial firm with a solid foundation and a good reputation – and that’s the background to Castillo’s comments on the stock. Laying out his bullish thesis, he writes, “More modest than expected downturn in HD trucks in the US, solid growth in MD, and strong execution of Accelera growth strategy result in better than expected sales and margins, driving positive earnings revisions. More importantly, a rebound in US Class 8 orders shifts investor focus to a stronger 2025/26, driving shares higher.”', 'Putting this into quantifiable terms, Castillo rates the shares as Overweight (Buy), and he sets a $278 price target that suggests a 17% one-year upside potential.', 'Castillo represents the bulls on this stock, but Wall Street is not quite ready to join him. The shares have a Hold consensus rating, based on 9 recent reviews with 3-5-1 breakdown to Buy-Hold-Sell. The stock is trading for $237.15, and its $257.50 average target price implies an 8.5% increase over the one-year time frame.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Mondelez International."", ""Mondelez International is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 47% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects."", ""To bring it all together, Mondelez International has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed.

Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha, as he's come to be known, has overseen a nearly 4,500,000% aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A)."", 'Buffett\'s ""recipe"" for success is well documented. It includes buying stakes in profitable companies for the long-term, as well as focusing on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and trusted management teams.', 'However, one of the ""ingredients"" to Berkshire Hathaway\'s success that doesn\'t receive enough credit is Buffett\'s love for dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders tend to be recurringly profitable, time-tested, and are capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks.', 'Most importantly, income stocks have a lengthy track record of outperformance. A recent study from the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past half century (1973-2022). This was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%) over the same timeline.', ""In 2024, Buffett's company is set to collect around $6 billion in dividend income (including preferred dividends). Interestingly enough, $4.65 billion of this total will be raked in from just six core holdings."", ""Among the nearly 50 stocks currently held in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio (not all of which pay dividends), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stands out as the top dog for Warren Buffett and his team when it comes to dividend income. The more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA stock held by Buffett's company will generate almost $992 million in annual income."", ""The Oracle of Omaha and his team really appreciate cyclical businesses, and bank stocks certainly fit the mold. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal part of the economic cycle, they're relatively short-lived. Instead of trying to time when recessions will occur, Buffett has packed his company's portfolio with time-tested winners like Bank of America that he knows can benefit from long-winded periods of expansion."", ""What's been particularly helpful for Bank of America of late is the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. Since March 2022, the Fed has increased its federal funds rate by 525 basis points. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is music to the ears of BofA, which is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks. Higher interest rates have added billions of dollars in net interest income each quarter."", ""Perhaps it's no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by a longshot -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for 47% of Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio, as of Jan. 9 -- is one of its top dividend stocks. Apple's $0.96-per-share payout translates into nearly $879 million in annual income for Buffett's company."", 'During Berkshire\'s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett described Apple as ""a better business than any we own."" This statement reflects Apple\'s exceptionally strong branding, highly loyal customer base, and its ability to out-innovate its competition. More than 15 years after its introduction, the iPhone still accounts for more than half of all smartphone market share in the U.S.', ""However, Apple's innovation goes well beyond the physical products that made it famous (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the ongoing evolution of Apple into a platforms' company. Focusing on subscription services should encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services, while also helping to soften the revenue fluctuations that are commonly observed during major iPhone replacement cycles."", ""The energy sector is often known for doling out robust dividends. Buffett is overseeing the collection of nearly $175.5 million in annual income from the 243.7 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) common stock held, as well as $679.2 million from $8.49 billion in Occidental preferred stock that's yielding 8% on an annual basis."", ""The roughly $14 billion Warren Buffett and his team currently have invested in Occidental is a clear bet on the spot price for crude oil remaining elevated or moving higher. Even though Occidental is an integrated oil and gas company -- in addition to drilling, it operates chemical plants -- it generates the lion's share of its revenue from drilling. If the spot price of oil climbs, it'll enjoy an outsized benefit."", ""On the other hand, Occidental Petroleum's balance sheet is somewhat of an anomaly compared to most of Buffett's investments. This is to say that the Oracle of Omaha often avoids heavily indebted businesses. Despite Occidental slashing its net debt by nearly half since completing its acquisition of Anadarko, it's still lugging around $18.6 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30. It'll need the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated to further improve its financial flexibility."", ""Another foundational dividend stock in Warren Buffett's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Based on Berkshire's ultralow cost basis of $3.2475 per share for Coca-Cola, the Oracle of Omaha's company is netting a 57% annual yield (Coca-Cola's base annual dividend is $1.84 per share), relative to cost."", 'The most-valuable thing Coca-Cola brings to the table for investors is predictability. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has ongoing operations in every other country. This leads to predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, and can provide the company with a steady organic growth boost from emerging markets. All told, Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales.', 'Branding and marketing are two identifiable keys to its success. According to Kantar\'s annual ""Brand Footprint"" report, Coke products have been chosen by consumers more than any other brand on the planet for 10 consecutive years (as of 2022). Aside from having a well-known brand, this is also a reflection of the company\'s top-tier marketing. Coke is utilizing digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to cater ads to younger audiences, while leaning on well-known brand ambassadors to remain connected with mature consumers.', ""Have I mentioned that energy stocks are known for potentially juicy dividends? Last year, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) increased its base annual payout for a 36th consecutive year, with its board also authorizing a share repurchase program of up to $75 billion. The more than 110 million shares of Chevron held by Berkshire entitle Buffett's company to almost $666 million in annual income."", 'Although the investment thesis with Chevron somewhat mirrors Occidental Petroleum, there are two distinct differences between these integrated energy companies. To start with, Chevron generates a sizable percentage of its sales from its downstream segment, which includes chemical plants and refineries. Being less reliant on drilling for revenue means Chevron is better hedged than Occidental in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines.', ""The other big difference between these two integrated operators is their balance sheets. Whereas Occidental is quite levered, Chevron has a net debt ratio of just 8.1%, as of Sept. 30. Among the major global energy companies, an argument can be made that Chevron's balance sheet offers the most financial flexibility."", ""The final Buffett stock that's generating more than $500 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is packaged foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC). Despite reducing its quarterly payout by 36% in 2019, Kraft Heinz is still doling out around $521 million each year to the Oracle of Omaha's company."", ""The beauty of consumer staples stocks like Kraft Heinz is that they provide a basic need good. Though consumers might reduce their discretionary spending during recessions, food isn't something people can live without. Further, Kraft Heinz's assortment of well-known brands affords the company exceptional pricing power."", 'However, consumers are becoming more cost-conscious following a period of historically high inflation. Kraft Heinz has reported multiple quarters of declining volume/mix, which suggests consumers are trading down to cheaper store-branded goods as prices climb. Considering that the company has quite a bit of debt on its balance sheet, reigniting consumer interest in its brands could prove challenging.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

It's an extraordinary record of growth that resulted from a combination of two things: Buffett's purchases of businesses outright and purchases of small pieces of quality companies\xa0through the stock market."", ""At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire's combined investment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) had a grand total of nearly $173 billion, with Apple making up most of that. Here's why any one of these top stocks would be great places to park some cash to start the new year."", ""Apple is Berkshire's largest holding, worth $156 billion at the end of the third quarter. Berkshire last added to its Apple stake in the first quarter of 2023, but the stock is up only 12% since the end of March, so it's not far above where Buffett himself or one of his investing deputies might have been buying more shares."", 'Buffett has long been an advocate of buying companies with a clear competitive advantage over rivals. He also places a high value on companies that generate profits that can be reinvested in the business at high rates of return. Apple certainly passes the latter test, earning an extraordinary return on invested capital of 56%.', ""Buffett admires Apple's ability to make products that people can't live without. It has won over millions of loyal customers, if not billions, with the installed base of devices doubling over the last seven years to 2 billion."", ""Customers who spend thousands of dollars on Apple's products are then spending more on apps, subscriptions, iCloud storage plans, AppleCare warranties, and other services, which generate much higher margins than iPhones. Services revenue has been the company's fastest-growing business in recent years, and this is contributing to a growing mountain of cash to distribute to shareholders."", ""Apple generated $99 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the last year, and it distributed about 15% of that to shareholders in quarterly dividend payments, with $77 billion going toward share buybacks. Buffett loves companies that generate lots of FCF and then use that cash to buy back shares. This reduces a company's total shares outstanding, and therefore increases Berkshire's percentage of ownership in the company."", ""Apple's brand, high margins, and high return on invested capital are great reasons to buy shares this month. Look for these qualities to lift the stock to new highs over the next few years and beyond."", ""Buffett's Berkshire has been building a large stake in top oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum over the last few years. The company bought more shares in December, bringing Berkshire's percentage ownership in the company to 34%."", 'As an energy company that derives most of its revenue from drilling, Occidental has financial results that can swing with the price of oil. The spot price in the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has fallen 8% over the last year, which has weighed on the stock price lately.', 'But Berkshire clearly likes the direction in which Occidental is moving. Occidental generated $6.9 billion in FCF over the last four quarters, despite lower oil prices. That is nearly three times what it produced five years ago.', ""Free cash flow has fallen over the last year with oil prices, but Occidental's management is making moves to keep growing FCF. In December, Occidental announced an agreement to acquire oil and gas producer Crownrock for $12 billion. While the acquisition will add to Occidental's debt burden (it ended the third quarter with $19 billion of net debt), Crownrock will also immediately benefit the company's FCF, which will prove valuable if oil prices slip."", 'Occidental has been using excess cash flow to pay down debt, buy back shares, and pay dividends -- all shareholder-friendly moves. The stock currently pays a dividend yield of 1.25% and trades at a cheap 8 times trailing FCF, which makes it clear why Berkshire was recently buying shares.', ""Mastercard stock has been a phenomenal investment for Berkshire, which held over $1.5 billion worth of the credit card brand's shares at the end of September. The stock has climbed 119% since 2019 and has a lot more upside over the long term."", 'More use of digital payment services has been a boon for leading credit card brands. It has driven more opportunities for a brand like Mastercard to become just a tap away for online and in-store payments. The company has a massive reach with 3.3 billion cards outstanding worldwide, driving over 37 billion transactions in the third quarter alone.', 'The growth of digital payments over the last decade helped drive consistent double-digit increases in revenue and earnings. Mastercard is still going strong with revenue up 11% year over year on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter.', ""One explanation for Mastercard's strong growth is that it doesn't have the risks of traditional financial institutions. It doesn't issue cards to consumers or carry any credit risk on its balance sheet."", 'Instead, it operates as a payments processor, and this business model translates to very high margins and a formidable competitive moat, since it would be too expensive to duplicate a global payment network that handles billions of transactions.', 'The business has grown FCF by 14% per year over the last decade. That growth has led to consistent increases in the dividend and share buybacks. In fact, Mastercard has returned all FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in recent years.', 'Mastercard still sees a lot of opportunities to expand acceptance of digital payments around the world, which could spell several more years of strong earnings and FCF growth. The stock returned over 400% cumulatively to shareholders over the last decade, and the next 10 years could see a similar result.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

Now that it has an approved treatment in Casgevy, there's undoubtedly going to be more of a spotlight on the company."", 'Gene-therapy treatments are growing in popularity, and for a larger healthcare company that is perhaps looking into getting into the business, it could be more attractive to simply buy CRISPR Therapeutics than to develop its own therapies.', ""Here's why CRISPR could be an attractive acquisition target, and what it would mean for investors if the company is bought out this year."", ""Although CRISPR's stock received some great news late last year with the approval of Casgevy, a one-time treatment for sickle cell disease it has been developing with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the stock hasn't exactly been taking off since then."", ""CRISPR's valuation sits at around $4.8 billion, which seems incredibly low given that at its peak, Casgevy could generate $3.9 billion in annual revenue. The company will share in the profits on Casgevy with Vertex. But with the treatment costing $2.2 million, odds are it should bring in a healthy profit for both businesses."", 'The two companies are also hoping that it obtains approval as a treatment for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. News on that decision should come by the end of March.', ""Now that CRISPR's business looks to be in much better shape, it should attract a higher valuation, especially since the treatment could give the business a path to profitability. The company has incurred a net loss of $416 million over the past four quarters."", ""For a potential acquirer, CRISPR's modest valuation could make it a fairly low-cost option to get into the gene-editing business."", 'When companies seek out potential acquisitions, the balance sheet is often one place that needs improvement. This is why you might sometimes see a company selling and offloading assets ahead of an acquisition. While an acquirer might like some aspects of the business, it might not want all of them, especially if it means the additional cash from a sale can help in reducing its debt.', ""In CRISPR's case, the company is well-funded, and it isn't carrying significant obligations on its books. As of Sept. 30, the biotech had cash and marketable securities worth more than $1.7 billion. That's nearly five times the amount of its total liabilities: $359 million."", 'CRISPR could pay off all of its liabilities, both short and long term, and still have more than $1 billion left in short-term liquid assets. For a potential acquirer, such a strong balance sheet is attractive.', 'If a company does end up acquiring the CRISPR this year, there are one of two probable scenarios for investors.', ""One is that if the deal involves stock, investors can have the opportunity to own shares of a larger business. This can happen if it's an all-stock deal or a mix of cash and stock. If investors receive shares as part of the deal, it allows them to continue to potentially benefit from CRISPR's growth. They could also decide to cash out and sell their shares. But given the volatility of the stock market, the potential profits might not be as lucrative as in an all-cash deal."", 'If the deal involves cash, then shareholders could be banking on a big payday coming their way. Depending on the premium an acquirer could pay, shareholders might get a much higher return on their investment than if they sold their investment prior to the acquisition.', ""The downside of an all-cash deal, however, is that investors would have to buy shares of the acquiring company to still profit from CRISPR's growth -- assuming the acquirer is a public company. If it's not possible to invest in the new or merged business, that means long-term investors would effectively see their gains from investing in CRISPR capped."", ""CRISPR looks like a fantastic growth stock to invest in. It's a lot less risky now that it has an approved gene therapy in its portfolio, and its strong balance sheet also ensures the company can fund more growth initiatives without worrying that it's going to run out of cash anytime soon. There's some risk with the stock since the company isn't profitable, but the business does appear to be on a more positive trajectory."", 'Acquisitions can be difficult to predict, but regardless of whether CRISPR gets bought out this year, the stock remains a great buy today.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Every stock you buy comes with some risk. And without risk, there would be no opportunity for reward.', 'That said, some stocks have lower risks than others. Some also have bigger opportunities for rewards than others. Which picks offer the best risk-reward propositions right now? Here are my three highest-conviction growth stocks to buy in 2024.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) certainly looks attractive from a risk perspective. It dominates the e-commerce market. Amazon's logistics and supply chain network is unsurpassed, giving the company an enviable moat."", ""The company also has a huge growth opportunity -- and not just in e-commerce. Amazon Web Services (AWS) ranks as the largest cloud services provider. Organizations will almost certainly continue racing to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI). This should enable AWS to grow rapidly, even with stiff competition from Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform."", 'I like that Amazon has retained a start-up mentality in many ways. It continually looks at new markets to enter. For example, the company launched a supply chain management service last year and just began selling cars online. Jeff Bezos\' statement from years ago that ""your margin is my opportunity"" remains a core component of Amazon\'s business model.', ""The stock is also a great pick to buy right now, in my view, because of its intense focus on improving profitability. Amazon's earnings more than tripled year over year in the third quarter of 2023. It expects Prime Video to become profitable in the not-too-distant future. I expect these efforts to show up in Amazon's quarterly results this year and provide nice catalysts that further boost its share price."", ""Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC) fully expects to deliver average total returns of between 12% and 15% per year. Those kinds of returns can double your money every five to six years. I'm confident the company will be able to achieve its goal over the long term, even though Brookfield Renewable's shares haven't performed well over the last 12 months."", ""If history is any guide, Brookfield Renewable will be able to pull it off. The renewable energy provider's average total return since 1999 is close to 16%. Its funds from operations (FFO) per unit have increased by a compound annual growth rate of more than 10% since 2012."", 'I have no doubt whatsoever that the demand for renewable energy will continue to rise over the next several years. For one thing, solar and onshore wind are now more cost-effective than coal and gas. Countries and major corporations across the world have also committed to aggressive carbon emission reduction goals that will be impossible to achieve without additional renewable energy.', ""But is Brookfield Renewable prepared to meet the increasing demand? Absolutely. The company's development pipeline capacity of 143,400 megawatts is more than 4.5 times greater than its current installed capacity. Brookfield Renewable also continues to expand via acquisitions. There are few companies with as sure-fire growth prospects, in my opinion."", ""You might be surprised to see a biotech stock on the list, considering the level of risk they face with potential pipeline setbacks. However, I'm highly optimistic about Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) for several reasons."", ""The company enjoys a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). Its nearest potential rival is at best years away from even having a chance at competing against Vertex's products. In the meantime, Vertex could be on track to soon roll out its most powerful (and profitable) CF therapy yet assuming the upcoming late-stage results for its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo are positive."", ""Vertex and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, now have the world's first CRISPR gene-editing therapy on the market. Casgevy has already been approved in the U.S. for treating sickle cell disease with another approval decision for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia on the way in March. Analysts project the new therapy could generate peak annual sales of over $2.2 billion, with Goldman Sachs estimating Casgevy could rake in $3.9 billion."", 'I also like the prospects for non-opioid pain drug VX-548. Vertex plans to report results from three late-stage studies of the drug early this year, which could lead to near-term regulatory filings.', ""Sure, there's more risk with some of the company's other pipeline programs, including its cell therapies that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes. However, with multiple likely blockbusters largely de-risked and its dominant position in CF, I think that Vertex is a virtual shoo-in to deliver solid growth for years to come."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here are three growth stocks to buy that could be massive long-term winners.', ""Early last year, some investors were wringing their hands over Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). They thought the tech giant had missed the boat on generative AI. OpenAI, in their minds, was eating Alphabet's lunch. Fast-forward to today, and Alphabet stock has soared more than 60% over the last 12 months."", ""In retrospect, it's clear that Alphabet didn't miss the boat on generative AI at all. The company plans to soon launch Gemini Ultra, an AI model that outperforms the best AI systems currently available on 30 of 32 widely used benchmarks."", ""AI should provide a huge long-term tailwind for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. That will especially be the case if the company stays at the forefront of AI tool development. I don't think that will be too much of a stretch, considering the expertise in Alphabet's Google Deepmind unit and the company's overall research and development (R&D) budget of close to $40 billion."", ""Alphabet has another major AI-related opportunity with its Waymo self-driving car technology business. It's a leader in developing quantum computers. The company is even researching how to extend the human life span. Maybe the stock won't be a massive winner over the next 20 years, but I wouldn't bet against it."", 'Think back to mid-2022 when the stock market had fallen quite a bit. Growth stocks had been hit especially hard. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) was one of them, with its shares plunging nearly 70% below its peak set in early 2021.', 'Those were only temporary headwinds, though. Over the last 12 months, MercadoLibre stock has soared close to 80%.', ""MercadoLibre isn't a household name in the U.S. but is well-known in Latin America. It operates the largest e-commerce platform in the region, with more than 50 million unique buyers."", ""There's still plenty of room to grow in the Latin American e-commerce market. MercadoLibre's top two e-commerce markets, Brazil and Mexico, are projected to expand by compound annual growth rates of 17% and 33%, respectively, through 2026. The company should have big opportunities in other Latin American countries, as well."", ""MercadoLibre has also leveraged its e-commerce platform to expand into adjacent markets and operates a large logistics business. Fintech is another key growth driver, with the company's MercadoPago digital payments products and services."", 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) has been one of the rare stocks in recent years that perform well, regardless of what the overall market does. Its shares jumped more than 31% in 2022 when the major market indexes sank. The biotech stock was a big winner last year with the momentum carrying over into 2024.', ""I predict that Vertex will be even more successful in the future than it's been in the past. My main reason for this optimistic view is that the company is expanding into lucrative markets outside of cystic fibrosis (CF)."", 'Vertex recently won U.S. approval for Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease. It awaits a second approval decision for the gene-editing therapy in treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The big biotech expects to soon report results from late-stage studies of VX-548, a non-opioid drug targeting acute pain.', 'Peering a little farther down the road, Vertex has a good shot at launching the first therapy to treat the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease. This disease affects more patients than CF.

And last I checked, United Launch Alliance (ULA) is still a private company.', ""Surprisingly, this means that the sale by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0of their  ULA space launch subsidiary, didn't happen as planned -- or as pundits predicted all year long in 2023. It also means we now have to ask a new question:"", 'Will Boeing and Lockheed sell ULA in 2024 instead?', 'And might ULA end up getting sold via an initial public offering (IPO)?', ""As The Wall Street Journal confirmed last month, there are (still) three companies currently bidding to acquire ULA from Boeing and Lockheed: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, defense shop Textron (NYSE: TXT), and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management."", ""Blue Origin, I argued last year, remains the leading contender, with plenty of reasons to want to own ULA -- and plenty of money to pay for it. If Blue were to acquire ULA, not only would it secure a captive customer to buy the BE-4 rocket engines that it builds. It would also own ULA's fleet of Atlas V launch vehicles still in service, as well as its design for the Vulcan Centaur rocket, which made a successful first flight just last week. That's in addition to its own New Glenn rocket that's still in development."", ""At the same time, the cost to acquire ULA -- which I've ballparked at $5.2 billion, but which several analysts have argued will fetch less -- amounts to proverbial pocket change found in the sofa cushions to a multibillionaire like Jeff Bezos."", 'Textron, a defense company probably best known for its helicopters, and having limited exposure to ""space,"" I\'d contend runs a distant second in this race. On the one hand, the company boasts a reasonably strong balance sheet, with $15.3 billion in market capitalization and only about $2.2 billion in net debt.', ""But the company doesn't have enough cash to buy ULA outright, without issuing new shares or taking on more debt. Textron does run a reasonably profitable business, generating $858 million in free cash flow over the past year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Over time, it could probably pay down any debt it takes on to buy ULA. But the purchase would still be a stretch -- and I just can't see Textron winning a bidding war against Jeff Bezos."", 'Cerberus is something of a wild card. On the one hand, the private equity powerhouse could potentially face down Bezos in a bidding war. On multibillion-dollar deals, Cerberus often recruits other investors to act alongside it, giving it the ability to offer higher prices while still spreading out its risk.', ""Cerberus has also shown an interest in space companies of late, buying midair rocket launch company Stratolaunch just before it went bankrupt in 2019 -- then turning around and using Stratolaunch to place a $17 million bid for some of Virgin Orbit's assets after that company did go bankrupt last year."", ""Still, to date Cerberus' reputation has been as a bit of a vulture and a bargain shopper in the space industry, picking up assets that no one else wanted in hopes of whipping them into shape and making them viable again. Paying through the nose to acquire one of America's two biggest space companies really doesn't seem Cerberus' speed to me. (If Cerberus did buy it, though, it'd likely turn around and later sell it again in an IPO -- see below)."", 'Which, again, is why I conclude that Blue Origin is the most likely buyer of United Launch Alliance.', ""And yet, what if I'm wrong? Or what if I'm right that Boeing and Lockheed will try to sell ULA to Blue Origin, but the Federal Trade Commission intervenes -- perhaps arguing that merging Blue and ULA would reduce competition in the space sector -- and forbids a sale?"", 'In that case, Boeing and Lockheed Martin will have a decision to make. They may decide to keep running ULA as a joint venture. Or they might try to sell ULA to everybody -- to hold an IPO and make United Launch Alliance its own publicly traded company.', 'With ULA coming off a successful maiden flight of its Vulcan Centaur rocket last week, and the company loudly trumpeting its backlog of 70 Vulcan launches already reserved, worth billions of dollars in future revenue, the time seems ripe for an IPO. Investors, too, would probably be very interested in such an event. With SpaceX still playing a perpetual game of ""will I or won\'t I"" (ever IPO), investors tired of waiting for the chance to invest in SpaceX might jump at the chance to own a ULA IPO as a reasonable alternative to investing in SpaceX.', 'Come to think of it, if the profit margins are good enough -- I might jump at that chance as well.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

Since he took the helm in 1965, the shares have enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 19.8% through 2022, doubling the benchmark S&P 500's 9.9% result."", ""With those market-crushing returns, it's always worthwhile to look at Berkshire's $360 billion stock portfolio to see which shares the company holds and determine whether any of them might help your portfolio beat the market. So, on that theme, here are two no-brainer Warren Buffett stocks to consider buying right now."", ""With a stake worth $28.6 billion, American Express (NYSE: AXP) represents 8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, making the global payments company its third-largest position. Berkshire first acquired American Express stock in 1991 and completed its $1.3 billion purchase in 1995; it has not bought or sold any shares since."", 'American Express is a longtime dividend-paying stock, first issuing its payout in 1989 and consistently increasing it through the years since. Today, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share, representing an annual yield of 1.3%.', ""Beyond its total return over the past few decades, American Express excels in one metric Buffett consistently favors: retained earnings. The calculation measures a company's net income or losses and subtracts the total dividends paid."", 'Management can then use the retained earnings to do any of the following: expand the business, make acquisitions, pay down debt, or repurchase stock.', 'Over the trailing 12 months, American Express generated $8 billion in net income and paid its shareholders $1.7 billion in dividends, retaining $6.3 billion. With this surplus, it acquired Nipendo, an Israel-based payments company, for an undisclosed amount and repurchased 2% of its own shares.', ""Over the past three years, management has smartly reduced its net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) by 91%, from $16.9 billion to $1.4 billion. As a result, it won't be saddled with paying high-interest expenses or relying on expensive debt while interest rates are at elevated levels."", ""One concern with American Express is that its total provision for credit losses (an expense set aside to allow for uncollected loans and loan payments) is rising as some consumers and commercial clients struggle with higher inflation and interest rates. Specifically, that key performance indicator was at $1.2 billion during the third quarter of 2023, up 58% year over year. Management doesn't seem too concerned, noting how its net write-off and delinquency rates are below pre-pandemic levels, but it's something shareholders should watch closely in the year ahead."", ""Lastly, regarding valuation, American Express looks like a cheap stock. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.4, significantly lower than competitors Mastercard and Visa at 29.7 and 26.6, respectively. When you consider Amex has nearly tripled the total return of those two over the past three years, the stock looks cheap and is worthy of investors' attention."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is Berkshire's longest-held stock and one that Warren Buffett has declared he would never think of selling -- even one share. The beverage maker, founded in 1892, holds elite status as a Dividend King, being an S&P 500 component that has paid and raised its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years."", 'Coca-Cola recently paid $0.46 per share for its fourth consecutive quarter, meaning shareholders should reasonably expect management to soon raise it for the 62nd consecutive year. As it stands, the current annual yield is 3.1%.', 'Beyond the iconic brand and dividend history, sales are on the rise again after taking a dip during the pandemic. Digging into the numbers, net operating revenue bottomed out in 2020 at $33 billion after generating $37 billion in 2019.', 'More recently, Coca-Cola generated $43 billion in 2022, and management guided for 2023 organic revenue (excluding currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions, divestitures, and structural changes) to grow 10% to 11%.', ""Notably, Coca-Cola has yet to return to its revenue's high-water mark of $48 billion in 2012, which brings us to one of its main risks: consumers' health habits. According to research by independent evaluator Keybridge, calories consumed from soda per person declined 11.8% from 2014 to 2020."", 'The good news is that the total beverage volume steadily increased by 8.9% from 2014 to 2020, meaning consumers still like buying drinks. As a result, Coca-Cola management has diversified its offerings over the past decade, acquiring the sparkling water Topo Chico for $220 million in 2017 and the sports drink BodyArmor for $5.6 billion in 2021.', 'Coca-Cola stock currently looks undervalued. It trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21.4, significantly below its five-year trailing average of 27.4.', ""When looking for a new stock to buy, it's easier to overlook some of the best companies in the world in favor of stocks with a lot of hype behind them. These two companies have a long history in the public markets and have consistently delivered solid returns for long-term shareholders, particularly with dividends and share repurchases."", ""To illustrate, in Warren Buffett's most recent shareholder letter, he wrote how, despite Berkshire not adding to its position in Coca-Cola since 1994, its dividends received grew from $75 million in 1994 to $704 million in 2022."", ""Similarly, Berkshire hasn't added to its position in American Express since 1995, and its dividends received grew from $41 million to $302 million in 2022. It's important to note that Berkshire's ownership stake has also increased significantly in both stocks due to share repurchases over the years."", ""For today's prospective buyers, both of these businesses trade at fair valuations and are established market leaders, making them worthy additions to a portfolio, especially for investors seeking dividends."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$13b ÷ (US$98b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 18%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 15% generated by the Beverage industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Coca-Cola compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 32% in that time. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Coca-Cola has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", 'On a side note, Coca-Cola has done well to reduce current liabilities to 25% of total assets over the last five years. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.', 'The main thing to remember is that Coca-Cola has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 48% to shareholders over the last five years.

Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha, as he's come to be known, has overseen a nearly 4,500,000% aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A)."", 'Buffett\'s ""recipe"" for success is well documented. It includes buying stakes in profitable companies for the long-term, as well as focusing on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and trusted management teams.', 'However, one of the ""ingredients"" to Berkshire Hathaway\'s success that doesn\'t receive enough credit is Buffett\'s love for dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders tend to be recurringly profitable, time-tested, and are capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks.', 'Most importantly, income stocks have a lengthy track record of outperformance. A recent study from the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past half century (1973-2022). This was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%) over the same timeline.', ""In 2024, Buffett's company is set to collect around $6 billion in dividend income (including preferred dividends). Interestingly enough, $4.65 billion of this total will be raked in from just six core holdings."", ""Among the nearly 50 stocks currently held in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio (not all of which pay dividends), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stands out as the top dog for Warren Buffett and his team when it comes to dividend income. The more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA stock held by Buffett's company will generate almost $992 million in annual income."", ""The Oracle of Omaha and his team really appreciate cyclical businesses, and bank stocks certainly fit the mold. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal part of the economic cycle, they're relatively short-lived. Instead of trying to time when recessions will occur, Buffett has packed his company's portfolio with time-tested winners like Bank of America that he knows can benefit from long-winded periods of expansion."", ""What's been particularly helpful for Bank of America of late is the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. Since March 2022, the Fed has increased its federal funds rate by 525 basis points. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is music to the ears of BofA, which is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks. Higher interest rates have added billions of dollars in net interest income each quarter."", ""Perhaps it's no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by a longshot -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for 47% of Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio, as of Jan. 9 -- is one of its top dividend stocks. Apple's $0.96-per-share payout translates into nearly $879 million in annual income for Buffett's company."", 'During Berkshire\'s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett described Apple as ""a better business than any we own."" This statement reflects Apple\'s exceptionally strong branding, highly loyal customer base, and its ability to out-innovate its competition. More than 15 years after its introduction, the iPhone still accounts for more than half of all smartphone market share in the U.S.', ""However, Apple's innovation goes well beyond the physical products that made it famous (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the ongoing evolution of Apple into a platforms' company. Focusing on subscription services should encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services, while also helping to soften the revenue fluctuations that are commonly observed during major iPhone replacement cycles."", ""The energy sector is often known for doling out robust dividends. Buffett is overseeing the collection of nearly $175.5 million in annual income from the 243.7 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) common stock held, as well as $679.2 million from $8.49 billion in Occidental preferred stock that's yielding 8% on an annual basis."", ""The roughly $14 billion Warren Buffett and his team currently have invested in Occidental is a clear bet on the spot price for crude oil remaining elevated or moving higher. Even though Occidental is an integrated oil and gas company -- in addition to drilling, it operates chemical plants -- it generates the lion's share of its revenue from drilling. If the spot price of oil climbs, it'll enjoy an outsized benefit."", ""On the other hand, Occidental Petroleum's balance sheet is somewhat of an anomaly compared to most of Buffett's investments. This is to say that the Oracle of Omaha often avoids heavily indebted businesses. Despite Occidental slashing its net debt by nearly half since completing its acquisition of Anadarko, it's still lugging around $18.6 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30. It'll need the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated to further improve its financial flexibility."", ""Another foundational dividend stock in Warren Buffett's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Based on Berkshire's ultralow cost basis of $3.2475 per share for Coca-Cola, the Oracle of Omaha's company is netting a 57% annual yield (Coca-Cola's base annual dividend is $1.84 per share), relative to cost."", 'The most-valuable thing Coca-Cola brings to the table for investors is predictability. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has ongoing operations in every other country. This leads to predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, and can provide the company with a steady organic growth boost from emerging markets. All told, Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales.', 'Branding and marketing are two identifiable keys to its success. According to Kantar\'s annual ""Brand Footprint"" report, Coke products have been chosen by consumers more than any other brand on the planet for 10 consecutive years (as of 2022). Aside from having a well-known brand, this is also a reflection of the company\'s top-tier marketing. Coke is utilizing digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to cater ads to younger audiences, while leaning on well-known brand ambassadors to remain connected with mature consumers.', ""Have I mentioned that energy stocks are known for potentially juicy dividends? Last year, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) increased its base annual payout for a 36th consecutive year, with its board also authorizing a share repurchase program of up to $75 billion. The more than 110 million shares of Chevron held by Berkshire entitle Buffett's company to almost $666 million in annual income."", 'Although the investment thesis with Chevron somewhat mirrors Occidental Petroleum, there are two distinct differences between these integrated energy companies. To start with, Chevron generates a sizable percentage of its sales from its downstream segment, which includes chemical plants and refineries. Being less reliant on drilling for revenue means Chevron is better hedged than Occidental in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines.', ""The other big difference between these two integrated operators is their balance sheets. Whereas Occidental is quite levered, Chevron has a net debt ratio of just 8.1%, as of Sept. 30. Among the major global energy companies, an argument can be made that Chevron's balance sheet offers the most financial flexibility."", ""The final Buffett stock that's generating more than $500 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is packaged foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC). Despite reducing its quarterly payout by 36% in 2019, Kraft Heinz is still doling out around $521 million each year to the Oracle of Omaha's company."", ""The beauty of consumer staples stocks like Kraft Heinz is that they provide a basic need good. Though consumers might reduce their discretionary spending during recessions, food isn't something people can live without. Further, Kraft Heinz's assortment of well-known brands affords the company exceptional pricing power."", 'However, consumers are becoming more cost-conscious following a period of historically high inflation. Kraft Heinz has reported multiple quarters of declining volume/mix, which suggests consumers are trading down to cheaper store-branded goods as prices climb. Considering that the company has quite a bit of debt on its balance sheet, reigniting consumer interest in its brands could prove challenging.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

These organizations are pioneering the use of advanced robotic technology in transforming various industries such as manufacturing and health. It is an intersection where innovation meets pragmatism, giving the world some spectacular breakthroughs and for those wise ones who invest in them – a future of bright financial prospects.', 'Diving deeper, we find a land quite diverse, filled with companies excelling at different niches of the robotics domain.

Also, HYMTF thrives by forming alliances, such as the one with Kia who increases its sales. The automaker sold 7.3 million units together in the year, which depicts a common strength for another car market.', 'The interest of Hyundai in robotics as an innovative direction is clear enough.

On Aug. 31, 2020, Honeywell, Salesforce, and Amgen joined the Dow, replacing Raytheon Technologies (now RTX), ExxonMobil, and Pfizer, respectively.', ""Honeywell stock popped toward the end of 2020. But over the past three years, the stock has been close to dead money, returning just 2.7% even when factoring in dividends. Here's why Honeywell stock deserved to languish, but why it could be a dividend stock worth buying now."", ""One look at the last five years of Honeywell's revenue and earnings, and it's hard to see how this company would be worth investing in at all."", ""Given its weak results, it's unsurprising that the industrial conglomerate has underperformed the market as of late. Honeywell has four segments -- Aerospace (commercial aviation equipment, commercial aviation aftermarket, defense, and space), Honeywell Building Technologies (products and building solutions), Performance Materials and Technologies (process solutions, advanced materials, Honeywell UOP for oil and gas), and Safety and Productivity Solutions (sensing and safety technologies, productivity solutions and services, warehouse and workflow solutions). Needless to say, Honeywell is a complicated and diverse business."", 'The industrial conglomerate business model has its pros and cons. When executed effectively, each individual business unit is self-reliant. And when you add them all together, they give the overarching business diversification and protect against cyclicality that can occur in end markets.', 'A good example is Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW), which has seven high-margin, highly profitable business units. The company enjoys top-line growth and margin expansion, which supports a sizable stock repurchase program and a reliable dividend. Illinois Tool Works is a Dividend King with 53 consecutive years of dividend increases.', 'Then you have companies like General Electric (NYSE: GE) that became bloated and inefficient. GE began selling off assets. And eventually, in January 2023, GE spun off its healthcare business. The decision has been a resounding success. After decades of underperforming the market, the stock is up 67.1% over the last year.', ""I'm not saying that Honeywell has reached GE-level stagnation. But its growth has ground to a halt, and something has to change."", ""No matter the business unit, Honeywell's overarching strategic plan (for a while now) has been integrating the digital world with the physical world. Essentially, increasing the performance and visibility of a product through sensors and data management."", 'An easy-to-understand example would be the difference between a traditional thermostat and the Honeywell Small and Medium Building Administrator. The cloud-based solution can monitor temperature controls across multiple sites to optimize comfort and save on energy costs.', 'Having so many business units and doing so many things gives Honeywell diversification. But it has also made it stodgy and overcomplicated. Years of promising innovation and investing heavily in the industrial internet of things have failed to translate to near-term benefits.', 'But if Honeywell can realign its business, become more flexible, and better articulate the performance of its newer products and services, then it could help the company enter a new growth phase.', 'On Dec. 11, Honeywell published a press release that could mark the beginning of this new growth period. The company is prioritizing organic growth by leaning into three megatrends -- automation, the future of aviation, and the energy transition. To quote the press release, ""This strategic clarity empowers our business leaders to better prioritize R&D efforts, capital expenditures, and go-to-market strategies, enabling us to make the right choices to drive higher levels of organic growth."" Honeywell is taking a step in the right direction by giving its teams more room to operate and cutting some of the inevitable red tape with such a large enterprise.', 'It also supports acquisitions to accelerate its growth. The press release states, ""The realignment provides the foundation for further portfolio optimization as we endeavor to fully align to our three compelling themes underpinned by digitalization. Our robust acquisition pipeline is focused on adding bolt-on businesses that fit these themes, while we are targeting select dispositions by trimming lines of business that are not aligned."" Put another way, Honeywell is going under the hood to drive organic growth, make acquisitions supporting that growth, and sell off whatever falls outside these objectives. If Honeywell executes this plan, the company should become simpler and more streamlined.', ""Despite these efforts, Honeywell is still only guiding for 4% to 7% organic growth, which would translate to low double-digit growth once factoring in margin expansion. In 2022, Honeywell posted organic growth of 6%, averaged just 5% organic growth between 2017 and 2021, and just 1% between 2014 and 2016. Needless to say, the last decade has featured lackluster growth, so investors shouldn't give Honeywell the benefit of the doubt."", ""Honeywell's complex structure can mask the progress of individual technologies and make it difficult to decipher the performance of legacy business units and new efforts. For example, Honeywell Forge is the company's software as a service solution -- covering for multiple industries. But given the breadth of Honeywell Forge, it's challenging to see the precise financial impact it is having on the business."", ""Honeywell's reporting reminds me of Amazon or Apple years ago. In the past, Amazon wouldn't single out Amazon Web Services' performance. And Apple wouldn't separate its hardware from its services. It made it challenging to know just how effective these aspects of the business were and, frankly, left investors in the dark. I'd like to see Honeywell split hardware and software by segment. That way, investors can get a better reading on growth and margins."", ""Admittedly, it may be a little early to buy Honeywell, as it could take years for its plan to materialize. Patient investors willing to wait will benefit from Honeywell's dividend, which yields 2.1% and has been increased for 13 consecutive years."", ""In addition to opaque reporting methods, I'd argue that Honeywell has been held back by good old-fashioned top-down corporate inefficiency more than a lack of innovation or losing ground to competitors. By realigning the business to focus on key megatrends, Honeywell could become an exciting opportunity if its growth rate accelerates."", 'It could take time to play out. But Honeywell has been on the right side of history when it comes to predicting the increased importance of digitalization and data in the industrial world. We have yet to see Honeywell truly monetize this transition in a big way. But if it does, the stock could stage a breakout.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Honeywell International right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Honeywell International, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Honeywell International wasn't one of them.

However, this doesn't mean the sector is entirely without companies that remunerate their shareholders. Some of its larger and more established companies not only hand out distributions on a regular basis, they also declared hefty dividend raises heading into 2024."", ""So take a bow, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH); both of these familiar sector names hiked their payouts at double-digit rates. Here's a brief rundown of both increases."", ""One of the most storied names in the U.S. pharmaceutical business, Eli Lilly started 2024 with gusto. It's got excellent momentum behind obesity treatment Zepbound, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last November (it was green-lit for diabetes in 2022 under the brand name Mounjaro)."", ""As we've seen with the white-hot Wegovy from Denmark's Novo Nordisk, Zepbound will be sold to a vast market in America where demand for weight-loss solutions is high. Given its size and prominence, Eli Lilly is guaranteed to be a strong competitor in this segment."", ""But that's only one solid product in a portfolio full of them. Zepbound will join drugs like breast cancer treatment Verzenio and diabetes medication Trulicity, both hugely popular medicines that have sold briskly (and are extremely likely to continue doing so)."", ""Eli Lilly's business is going gangbusters, which is why investors have flocked to its stock. Thanks to that, it is now the world's most highly capitalized pharmaceutical company, worth a staggering $593 billion-plus."", ""It also operates a business that throws off plenty of cash; its latest annual free cash flow figure topped $5 billion, more than enough to take care of the $3.5 billion or so it paid out in dividends. That situation shouldn't change with the 15% dividend raise the company declared back in December, pushing the quarterly distribution to $1.30 per share."", ""There's still time to take advantage of Eli Lilly's latest dividend raise, although the bad news is that -- partially as a consequence of the stock's long-tail rally -- it doesn't yield much. It'll be paid on March 8 to investors of record as of Feb. 15, and at the current stock price the yield would be 0.8%."", 'Elsewhere in the healthcare industry, we have another monster of a company -- big insurer UnitedHealth. Like Eli Lilly, it tips the scales in terms of market cap, with a figure just under $500 billion. Also similar to its pharmaceutical cousin, it enacted a double-digit percentage dividend raise in 2023, in this case a 14% lift to $1.88 per share.', 'According to American Medical Association research, the company was the No. 1 nationwide health insurer in the U.S. in 2022, with a market share of 14%.', 'Meanwhile, senior citizens are becoming an increasingly larger share of the U.S. population. Older folks generally need more healthcare, and this plays very well into the hands of big providers such as UnitedHealth. The company has also been very acquisitive for many years, and the combination of these two dynamics has made for some impressive development in certain line items.', ""Chiefly we're talking about annual revenue, which ballooned by nearly $100 billion in the relatively short space between 2018 and 2022 (landing at more than $324 billion in the latter year). Profitability isn't all that high, but I'm only thinking relative to the top line. For example, in 2022 UnitedHealth's headline net income was over $20 billion, representing solid (16%) growth over 2021."", ""Ditto for free cash flow; this rose at an 18% year-over-year pace in 2022 to over $23 billion. That was more than sufficient to cover the sub-$6 billion dividend payout and $7 billion in share repurchases, and provide enough left over to support the company's business in myriad ways."", ""Unfortunately, investors can't get the jump on this dividend raise they way they can with Eli Lilly's. UnitedHealth's 14% hike took effect with the company's distribution in June 2023. At the moment, that $1.88 per share yields 1.4%."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

That's why I plan to add them to my retirement portfolio this January. A big factor driving my confidence in their future performance is their ability to pay a growing dividend.

They should have the ability to grow their dividends at above-average rates in the future. That's a big driver of my conviction that they can produce above-average total returns, which could enable me to retire sooner."", 'ADP has an incredible track record of growing its dividend. The payroll and human capital management solutions provider delivered its 49th straight year of dividend increases in 2023. That puts it one year shy of joining the elite group of Dividend Kings. ', ""ADP stands out among other dividend stocks because of its above-average yield and growth profile. The company currently offers a 2.4% dividend yield, well above the S&P 500's 1.5% yield. Meanwhile, it has been growing its payout at an above-average rate. It has delivered 8.3% compound annual dividend growth over the last five years, including giving investors a 12% raise in 2023. That's higher than the S&P 500's 6% compound annual dividend growth rate during that period. "", 'ADP is in an excellent position to expand its higher-yielding payout at an above-average rate in the future. The company expects to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% to 13% annually in the coming years, meaning it could deliver double-digit annual dividend growth. That sets ADP up to produce a 13% to 15% average annual total return when adding its earnings growth rate to its dividend income. That should beat the market over the long term. ', 'EQT has a spotty record when it comes to paying dividends. The natural gas giant suspended its payout in 2020 to retain additional cash to repay debt. It resumed paying dividends in 2021, setting the new quarterly payment at less than half its pre-pandemic level. EQT has since increased its payment twice (boosting it by 25% in 2022 and 5% last year). ', ""The company could have the fuel to grow its slightly above-average dividend (currently yielding 1.7%) at a high-octane rate in the coming years. Fueling that view is EQT's robust free cash flow growth prospects:"", ""As that slide shows, EQT could produce a cumulative $14 billion in free cash flow over the next several years if natural gas prices stay on their current projected path. The company's growing scale and increased access to premium-priced markets drive that view. It recently signed two of the largest-ever pipeline deals and secured capacity in an LNG export facility, which should significantly increase its free cash flow in the coming years. "", ""That would give EQT a mountain of excess cash to repay debt, repurchase shares, and pay dividends. As debt comes down to its target of $3.5 billion (from nearly $5.9 billion at the end of the third quarter following its acquisitions of Tug Hill and XcL Midstream), EQT will have more excess free cash to return to shareholders. EQT's growing free cash flow and cash returns could give it the fuel to continue producing high-octane total returns. "", ""Companies that grow their dividend have historically outperformed the S&P 500. That data is driving me to load my portfolio with companies I believe can deliver above-average total returns in the future as they increase their dividends. ADP and EQT fit that criteria.

If you want to skip our discussion on the airline industry, you can go directly to the 5 Safest Airlines in the World for 2024.', 'The global airline industry is an integral part of the global economy as it facilitates international trade and tourism. Currently, more than 5,000 airlines have over 23,000 aircraft, serving over 41,000 airports worldwide, as per the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Airlines are divided into three categories, namely traditional carriers, low-cost carriers, and cargo. Each category has its own target market and business model. Major players within the global airline industry include American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL).', 'According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the estimated revenue for the international airline industry in 2023 was $896 billion, with forecasted 2024 revenue being $964 billion. These figures translate into a year-on-year change of 21.7% and 7.6% for 2023 and 2024, respectively. The estimated profit margin for 2023 is 2.6%, while the 2024 forecasted profit margin for the airline industry is 2.7%. This profitability comes three years after the record net loss of approximately $140 billion in 2020 due to COVID-19. The main reason for a positive outlook in 2023 and 2024 is the resurgence of demand post-pandemic, resulting in a rise in both passenger and cargo transport. Except for Asia-Pacific, all regions are expected to reach or surpass pre-COVID levels in passenger traffic in 2024. However, as the pent-up demand from the pandemic decreases, the sharp growth in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) witnessed in 2022-2023 will also normalize in 2024. The airline industry is anticipated to experience a positive but relatively narrow profitability margin in 2024 due to normalized growth rates and rising expenses. However, this margin is notably slimmer compared to industries such as technology or oil and gas. The industry’s profitability is also quite vulnerable to uncertainties due to economic and geopolitical factors. These include high interest rates, the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East, supply-chain issues at aircraft manufacturers’ end, staff shortages, and the rising costs of compliance. The industry will have to navigate through the uncertainties caused by these factors for better financial health.', 'Alaska Airlines Incident Spurs Regulatory Action', 'The airline industry\'s safety standards have been called into question following a few recent incidents.

This decision was made to conduct additional safety checks following an incident involving Alaska Airlines on January 5, where a cabin panel blew off during a flight. The two major US carriers utilizing the affected aircraft, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, canceled many flights in the past week following the grounding. FAA Administrator Whitaker shared that he views the issues with the MAX 9 as a manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Highlighting a history of production challenges at Boeing Co.
