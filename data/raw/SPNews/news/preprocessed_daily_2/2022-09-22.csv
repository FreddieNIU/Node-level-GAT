It has amassed assets over $9.46 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.03%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 16% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB) accounts for about 2.53% of total assets, followed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM).The top 10 holdings account for about 17.26% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHV seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index containing the large-cap value portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -14.21% so far this year and is down about -6.02% in the last one year (as of 09/22/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $60.93 and $74.19.The ETF has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 23.91% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 533 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. LargeCap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHV is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $49.92 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $94.62 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab.

This will take the annual payment to 3.0% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Texas Instruments was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. The company is clearly earning enough to pay this type of dividend, but it is definitely focused on returning cash to shareholders, rather than growing the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 2.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 58%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendTexas Instruments Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.68 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $4.96. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 22% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Texas Instruments has impressed us by growing EPS at 18% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Texas Instruments' DividendIn summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The payments look okay by most measures, the lack of cash flow could definitely cause problems for them in the future. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

STM, Amtech Systems, Inc. ASYS and Texas Instruments, Inc TXN.Industry: SemiconductorLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1983254/3-promising-picks-from-the-slowing-semiconductor-industryCompanies in the Semiconductor – General industry are at the forefront of the ongoing technological revolution based on HPC, AI, automated driving, IoT and so forth. These semiconductors also enable the cloud to function and help analyze the data into actionable insights that can be used by companies to operate more efficiently.  The pandemic led companies to ramp up technology investments in order to stay operational when it was unsafe for us to go to work or meet people. But since this meant that a lot of infrastructure was built out in advance, demand was expected to slow down in the near future. But a possible recession in 2023 is further weakening the outlook. Longer-term trends continue to favor digitization, cloud, AI, etc., which will drive strong demand for semiconductorThis is not the best place to invest in right now, but STMicroelectronics. Amtech Systems and Texas Instruments look relatively attractive.About the IndustryThe companies grouped under the Semiconductor – General category produce a broad range of semiconductor devices, both integrated and discrete, like microprocessors, graphics processors, embedded processors, chipsets, motherboards, wireless and wired connectivity products, DLPs and analog, serving multiple end markets. It includes companies like NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Intel and STMicroelectronics.According to the latest data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor sales growth in the second quarter of 2022 decelerated to 13.3%, reaching $152.5 billion. 2021 sales were up 26.2% to the highest-ever annual total. The Americas were the strongest region, growing 29%. All regions were down month-to-month. The 2022 projection of 8.8% growth was not revised. Gartner forecasts 7.4% growth this year.Story continuesMajor Themes Shaping the IndustryThe long-term outlook for the industry remains robust because of its being on the building-block side of technology, which makes it crucial for the proliferation of the Internet and the ongoing digitization of every aspect of life. The short-term outlook appears bleak however. The pandemic has accelerated the move toward digitization, but it has created a lot of imbalances in demand and supply. The smartphone market for example (a primary application of semiconductors) is seeing issues on both the demand and the supply sides. Demand is affected by inflation while supply is affected by not only inflation but also geo-political tensions, China shutdowns and ongoing supply chain constraints, according to IDC. This has led the research firm to lower its 2022 forecast to a 3.5% decline (previous 1.6% growth), followed by growth of 5% in 2023. The other major chip consumer is the PC market, where the consumer and education segments have been slowing down following two years of very strong growth. The current macroeconomic weakness is also weakening the outlook for enterprise demand. As a result, IDC expects a 12.8% decline this year followed by a 2.6% decline in 2023 before growth returns in 2024.The good news is that some of the weakness in these traditional markets is being made good by strength in emerging areas like AI and machine learning, IoT, and automotive. ReportLinker expects the AI chip market to grow at a CAGR of 29.9% between 2022 and 2030. Driven by Internet connectivity across the developed and developing worlds and supportive technology such as sensor networks and AI adoption, the IoT market is also expected to grow steadily over the next few years. Future Market Insights expects the market to grow at a 5.3% CAGR between 2022 and 2032. Mordor Intelligence expects a stronger 14.7% CAGR between 2022 and 2027. Automotive electronics is another area of evolving needs with increasing electronics (including ADAS), safety enhancements and transition to electrified power trains being important drivers. Grand View Research estimates a 10.7% CAGR through 2025, which it attributes to awareness regarding energy-efficient lighting systems, as well as increasing sales of luxury vehicles that come fitted with navigation and infotainment systems. Automation and robotics, with increasing adoption across industrial operations, are other areas of growth. These strong end markets will drive continued demand for semiconductor components for years to come.As the growth potential in emerging markets grows, regulatory (and/or political) issues in China and the U.S., can play an increasingly important role. The government’s strong stance against prime trading partner China has cast a shadow over the space. Semiconductor companies in particular stand to benefit from a truce between the U.S. and China as the Chinese government’s drive to build its own industry requires collaborations with leading semiconductor players. Moreover, commercial sales to China would help fund costly R&amp;D in the U.S. Such a truce seems increasingly unlikely because of ongoing geopolitics. The government is also concerned about IP protection and is trying to delay as far as possible China's own technological maturity. Be that as it may, the $52 billion infusion from the CHIPS Act (when adopted) will be a big boost to the domestic semiconductor market.Because end devices have to be priced lower to reach more people, the pressure on companies to bring down cost remains. But although companies still find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or where the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost, governments across the world are waking up to the strategic value of onshore chip production. The tensions with China have also increased the importance of diverse supply chains. Industry consolidation should continue however, as larger players add expertise and capacity through acquisitions. There’s also likely to be close collaboration with device makers, facilitating quicker consumption and better inventory management.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Deteriorating ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry is a stock group within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that near-term prospects aren’t too bright. Our research shows that the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries underperforms the top 50% by a factor of 1:2.An industry’s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is normally because the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate is encouraging. The opposite is true for stocks in the bottom 50% of industries. In this case, the aggregate earnings estimate for 2022 is down 25.9% from the year-ago level. The aggregate earnings estimate for 2023 is down 34.2% from last year. The numbers have deteriorated every month since February.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceTracking the performance of the Zacks Semiconductor – General Industry over the past year shows that the industry has traded higher than both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector and the S&amp;P 500 index up to December 2021. But starting this year, its performance has been choppy and other than the pop in March, it has steadily declined. As of now, it trails both the industry and the S&amp;P 500.The industry lost 36.3% over the past year compared to the 31.5% loss of the broader sector and the 13.6% loss of the S&amp;P 500 index.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing semiconductor companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 21.1X, which is below its median level of 25.5X over the past year. However, the S&amp;P 500 trades at 16.6X while the sector trades at 19.9X. Therefore, the industry appears overvalued in both these comparisons.The five-year story is the same. During this time, the industry has traded as high as 34.34X, as low as 12.86X and at the median of 19.26X.3 Stocks Worth ConsideringSTMicroelectronics N.V.: The company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of semiconductor integrated circuits and discrete devices used in a wide variety of microelectronic applications, including telecommunications systems, computer systems, consumer products, automotive products and industrial automation and control systems.STMicroelectronics is seeing strong demand across all segments although the auto market appears to be the strongest.  Favorable mix and strong pricing remain positive for profitability, offsetting the impact of rising input costs.

9,2b8d5044-0bcf-35f3-8660-cb01764ac9dd,TXN,2022-09-22,3 Promising Picks from the Slowing Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-promising-picks-slowing-semiconductor-202008803.html,1663791608,STORY,"['STM', 'TXN', '^GSPC']","[Companies in the Semiconductor – General industry are at the forefront of the ongoing technological revolution based on HPC, AI, automated driving, IoT and so forth. These semiconductors also enable the cloud to function and help analyze the data into actionable insights that can be used by companies to operate more efficiently.  The pandemic led companies to ramp up technology investments in order to stay operational when it was unsafe for us to go to work or meet people. But since this meant that a lot of infrastructure was built out in advance, demand was expected to slow down in the near future. But a possible recession in 2023 is further weakening the outlook. Longer-term trends continue to favor digitization, cloud, AI, etc., which will drive strong demand for semiconductors. This is not the best place to invest in right now, but STMicroelectronics. Amtech Systems and Texas Instruments look relatively attractive.About the IndustryThe companies grouped under the Semiconductor – General category produce a broad range of semiconductor devices, both integrated and discrete, like microprocessors, graphics processors, embedded processors, chipsets, motherboards, wireless and wired connectivity products, DLPs and analog, serving multiple end markets. It includes companies like NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Intel and STMicroelectronics.According to the latest data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor sales growth in the second quarter of 2022 decelerated to 13.3%, reaching $152.5 billion. 2021 sales were up 26.2% to the highest-ever annual total. The Americas were the strongest region, growing 29%. All regions were down month-to-month. The 2022 projection of 8.8% growth was not revised. Gartner forecasts 7.4% growth this year.Major Themes Shaping the IndustryThe long-term outlook for the industry remains robust because of its being on the building-block side of technology, which makes it crucial for the proliferation of the Internet and the ongoing digitization of every aspect of life. The short-term outlook appears bleak however. The pandemic has accelerated the move toward digitization, but it has created a lot of imbalances in demand and supply. The smartphone market for example (a primary application of semiconductors) is seeing issues on both the demand and the supply sides. Demand is affected by inflation while supply is affected by not only inflation but also geo-political tensions, China shutdowns and ongoing supply chain constraints, according to IDC. This has led the research firm to lower its 2022 forecast to a 3.5% decline (previous 1.6% growth), followed by growth of 5% in 2023. The other major chip consumer is the PC market, where the consumer and education segments had been slowing down following two years of very strong growth. The current macroeconomic weakness is also weakening the outlook for enterprise demand. As a result, IDC expects a 12.8% decline this year followed by a 2.6% decline in 2023 before growth returns in 2024.Story continues The good news is that some of the weakness in these traditional markets is being made good by strength in emerging areas like AI and machine learning, IoT, and automotive. ReportLinker expects the AI chip market to grow at a CAGR of 29.9% between 2022 and 2030. Driven by Internet connectivity across the developed and developing worlds and supportive technology such as sensor networks and AI adoption, the IoT market is also expected to grow steadily over the next few years. Future Market Insights expects the market to grow at a 5.3% CAGR between 2022 and 2032. Mordor Intelligence expects a stronger 14.7% CAGR between 2022 and 2027. Automotive electronics is another area of evolving needs with increasing electronics (including ADAS), safety enhancements and transition to electrified power trains being important drivers. Grand View Research estimates a 10.7% CAGR through 2025, which it attributes to awareness regarding energy-efficient lighting systems, as well as increasing sales of luxury vehicles that come fitted with navigation and infotainment systems. Automation and robotics, with increasing adoption across industrial operations, are other areas of growth. These strong end markets will drive continued demand for semiconductor components for years to come. As the growth potential in emerging markets grows, regulatory (and/or political) issues in China and the U.S., can play an increasingly important role. The government’s strong stance against prime trading partner China has cast a shadow over the space. Semiconductor companies in particular stand to benefit from a truce between the U.S. and China as the Chinese government’s drive to build its own industry requires collaborations with leading semiconductor players. Moreover, commercial sales to China would help fund costly R&amp;D in the U.S. Such a truce seems increasingly unlikely because of ongoing geopolitics. The government is also concerned about IP protection and is trying to delay as far as possible, China’s own technological maturity. Be that as it may, the $52 billion infusion from the CHIPS Act (when adopted) will be a big boost to the domestic semiconductor market. Because end devices have to be priced lower to reach more people, the pressure on companies to bring down cost remains. But although companies still find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or where the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost, governments across the world are waking up to the strategic value of onshore chip production. The tensions with China have also increased the importance of diverse supply chains. Industry consolidation should continue however, as larger players add expertise and capacity through acquisitions. There’s also likely to be close collaboration with device makers, facilitating quicker consumption and better inventory management.   Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Deteriorating ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry is a stock group within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that near-term prospects aren’t too bright. Our research shows that the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries underperforms the top 50% by a factor of 1:2.An industry’s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is normally because the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate is encouraging. The opposite is true for stocks in the bottom 50% of industries. In this case, the aggregate earnings estimate for 2022 is down 25.9% from the year-ago level. The aggregate earnings estimate for 2023 is down 34.2% from last year. The numbers have deteriorated every month since February.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceTracking the performance of the Zacks Semiconductor – General Industry over the past year shows that the industry has traded higher than both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector and the S&amp;P 500 index up to December 2021. But starting this year, its performance has been choppy and other than the pop in March, it has steadily declined. As of now, it trails both the industry and the S&amp;P 500.The industry lost 36.3% over the past year compared to the 31.5% loss of the broader sector and the 13.6% loss of the S&amp;P 500 index.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing semiconductor companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 21.1X, which is its below its median level of 25.5X over the past year. However, the S&amp;P 500 trades at 16.6X while the sector trades at 19.9X. Therefore, the industry appears overvalued in both these comparisons.The five-year story is the same. During this time, the industry has traded as high as 34.34X, as low as 12.86X and at the median of 19.26X.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks Worth Considering STMicroelectronics N.V.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, STMicroelectronics is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that STM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.16, while TXN has a forward P/E of 17.76. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 1.83. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.90.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 3.16. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TXN has a P/B of 10.77.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help STM earn a Value grade of B, while TXN has been given a Value grade of C.STM sticks out from TXN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that STM is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to the macro-economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions.onsemi has been able to beat the cyclical downtrend as investors show bullish sentiments regarding the stock. It has been investing in strategic areas like intelligent power and sensing. onsemi has been investing heavily in building its intelligent power and sensing products to help address key high-growth megatrends in automotive, industrial and plug power.In the second quarter, despite ongoing market volatility, onsemi reported that automotive and industrial revenue accounted for 66% of its overall business and combined grew 38% year over year. This was driven by the adoption of intelligent power and sensing solutions in the markets like automotive due to the electric vehicle (EV) megatrend.onsemi’s investments in intelligent power and sensing reflect the company’s strategy to provide differentiated and varied solutions to its customers to drive top-line growth. ON is reallocating its focus to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate the price-to-value discrepancies.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Diversifying Product Portfolio to Drive Top Lineonsemi recently announced that it has approved an exit plan to close one of its divisions in the advanced solutions group segment to further enable the company to direct its investments to high-growth margin business segments.The unit is generally associated with the Quantenna business division, which the company acquired in 2019. Slow growth for the Quantenna business segment products has stunted the analog solutions group revenues. In the second quarter of 2022, advanced solutions group or ASG revenues of $716.7 million (34.4% of revenues) increased 4% on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesThis news comes after onsemi’s announcement that it is expanding its silicon carbide (SiC) facility in Hudson, NH. The newly inaugurated hub will increase ON’s SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year and address certain supply-chain bottlenecks.This will aid in fully controlling onsemi’s SiC manufacturing supply chain, from sourcing silicon carbide powder and graphite raw material to delivering fully packaged SiC devices.onsemi’s recent expansion of its Hudson facility will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure and is an important contributor to decarbonization. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Further positively impacting onsemi’s decision to diversify its product portfolio and expand operations is President Biden's decision to the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China. Onsemi peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The recent declaration by the government will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from the likes of Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will aid EV makers in achieving faster charging and help reduce EV weight. This helps STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.However, onsemi which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects demand to continue outpacing supply throughout 2022.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Range Resources (RRC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this independent oil and gas company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Range Resources is 14.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 171.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 163%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Range Resources is 91.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 34%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 75.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 18.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Range Resources have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.9% over the past month.Bottom LineRange Resources has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Range Resources well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nucor Steel Brandenburg is the first steel mill in the world to pursue certification under LEED v4, which is more stringent than previous LEED rating systems and ambitiously aligns each credit category with sustainable performance, climate change, and revolutionizes the manufacturing landscape through third-party transparency and reporting requirements.""Sustainability has been at the core of Nucor's business model since we first started making steel in the 1960s. Our recycling production method makes us one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world. LEED certification extends our sustainability efforts to the materials and operating system choices we make in constructing this new steel mill,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer.The specific LEED features of Nucor Steel Brandenburg include preservation of a large portion of forested area on the property, lighting reduction strategies, reduced parking footprint, support for green vehicles, and water and energy efficiency measures. In addition, over 75% of the construction waste generated building the steel mill has been diverted from landfills. Sustainable building materials, many directly produced by Nucor divisions, have also been used in the construction of the mill.""Our Nucor Steel Brandenburg team is proud to be the first Nucor mill to undertake LEED v4 certification. We make our products in a sustainable way and these products, such as steel for offshore wind towers, are going to help build the green economy. It is only natural that we would construct this mill using sustainable materials and practices,"" said Johnny Jacobs, Vice President and General Manager of Nucor Steel Brandenburg.Expected to begin production at the end of 2022, the new $1.7 billion Nucor Steel Brandenburg facility will produce 1.2 million tons of steel plate annually. It will be able to produce 97% of plate products consumed domestically and will be one of only a few mills in the world capable of supplying the critical steel components required to build offshore wind farms.Story continuesThe US Green Building Council created the LEED rating in 1998 as a way to standardize and recognize sustainable construction methods. Since the first release (LEED v1) subsequent versions have pushed the building industry towards higher levels of sustainable design and construction. The current rating system is LEED v4.In addition to pursuing LEED v4 certification, Nucor will continue to be the sustainable leader in the steel industry by further reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity, which is already among the lowest in the world. Nucor is lowering its GHG intensity by increasing its utilization of renewable energy and supporting the continued growth of clean power generation in the U.S.; investing in new energy efficiency technologies; capturing and storing CO2 emissions; and encouraging GHG reductions throughout the steel supply chain.Through its use of recycled scrap-based electric arc furnaces, Nucor's steelmaking GHG intensity is less than one-fourth of the global average and one-fifth of the average integrated steel producer. Earlier this year, Nucor began producing Econiq™, the world's first net-zero carbon steel at scale, to help its customers meet their sustainability goals.About Nucor  Nucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel -- in bars, beams, sheet and plate; hollow structural section tubing; electrical conduit; steel racking; steel piling; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; precision castings; steel fasteners; metal building systems; insulated metal panels; overhead doors; steel grating; and wire and wire mesh. Nucor, through The David J. Joseph Company, also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and hot briquetted iron / direct reduced iron; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nucor (NUE) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $8 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 20, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $8 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.97 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nucor has an Earnings ESP of 0.38%.NUE is just one of a large group of Basic Materials stocks with a positive ESP figure. Air Products and Chemicals (APD) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on November 3, 2022, Air Products and Chemicals holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.79 a share 44 days from its next quarterly update.Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.34% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78.Story continuesNUE and APD's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting a decline in inflation in August due to a significant drop in energy prices and travel costs. However, food, shelter (housing and home building), vehicles and medical services drove costs higher in August.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and various other top Fed officials with voting rights have indicated that the rigorous rate hike will continue until inflation is at least down close to the Fed’s 2% target rate.After August’s CPI data, market participants are expecting another 75 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate in the September FOMC of the Fed is a foregone conclusion.

However, the financial sector stands to be positively impacted by the tightening cycle. During a higher-interest rate environment, profit margins can expand for those in the sector, particularly insurance companies and banks.Three highly-ranked stocks in the Zacks Financial Sector – Bank OZK OZK, Ares Capital Corporation ARCC, and Unum Group UNM – could all be options for investors to consider in fighting back against a hawkish Fed.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks have already widely outperformed the general market in 2022, undoubtedly a positive.For the cherry on top, all three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Let’s take a deeper dive into each one.Unum GroupUnum Group provides disability insurance, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and employee-paid group benefits and related services.Analysts have been overwhelmingly bullish over the last several months, pushing their earnings estimates higher across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUNM carries a very favorable growth profile; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $6.11 for FY22, reflecting a stellar double-digit 40% Y/Y uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to rising earnings estimates and supercharged bottom line growth, UNM’s annual dividend yields a rock-solid 3.2% paired with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 6.2%.Further, the company’s yield is much higher than its Zacks Financial Sector average of 2.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the icing on the cake, UNM shares are cheap; the company’s 6.7X forward earnings multiple represents a staggering 54% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Story continuesUNM carries a Style Score of an A for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBank OZKBank OZK offers financial products and services, including savings accounts, personal and business loans, debit and credit cards, mortgages, cash management, online banking services, and many others.OZK’s earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOZK has been on a blazing-hot earnings streak, exceeding both revenue and earnings estimates in each of its previous nine quarters.

29,97328bae-7b44-3fc6-9069-185e5acbeec1,PVH,2022-09-22,Clearfield and PVH have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clearfield-pvh-highlighted-zacks-bull-125112421.html,1663678272,STORY,"['PVH', 'CLFD', 'CHK', 'REPYY']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 20, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Clearfield CLFD as the Bull of the Day and PVH PVH asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, Shell plc SHEL and Repsol SA REPYY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Clearfield is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that manufactures, markets, and sells standard and custom passive connectivity products to the fiber-to-the-premises, enterprises, and original equipment manufacturers markets in the United States and internationally.While the markets have gone lower in 2022, CLFD has gone higher. Despite a big drop in price over the last month, the stock is still up over 10% on the year.Obviously, Clearfield is doing something right, but in a market that is so negative, investors are asking if the stock can maintain its relative strength. And if it can hold up, should the bulls expect a move back to 2022 highs into the end of the year?About the CompanyClearfield was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Minneapolis,MN. It employs 250 people and has a market cap of $1.25 Billion.Clearfield provides fiber protection, fiber management and fiber delivery solutions that enable rapid and cost-effective fiber-fed deployment throughout the broadband service provider space. The company has a strong competitive position as 5G and NG-PON2 technologies are rolled out to meet rapidly growing demand.The stock has Zacks Style Scores of “F” in Growth and Value. However, a recent earnings beat has caught investors’ attention.Q3 Earnings BeatIn late July, Clearfield reported a 37% EPS beat for Q3. The company saw Q3 revenues almost double year over year and raised its FY revenue outlook.  FY22 revenues were taken to a range of $243-247M v the $218M expected.Gross profit margin was down year over year, but their quarter over quarter backlog was up 16% to $157M.Story continuesThe quarter saw new records for quarterly net sales and quarter end backlog.Management commented that they are “making meaningful progress on our ‘Now of Age’ strategic plan to expand our capacity and rapidly scale our business to meet the significant market demand for high-speed broadband.”Investors cheered the news, sending the stock from $85 to $100 in just a few days. This move over 15% higher broke all-time highs and the stock eventually hit $130 before pulling back.Analyst EstimatesOver the last 60 days, estimates have been trending higher. For the current quarter, we have seen a move from $0.70 to $0.80, or 14%.Looking down the road, analysts see the momentum continuing. Over the last 60 days, the current year has seen estimates go from $2.77 to $3.13, or 13%. For next year, analysts have taken numbers 16% higher.Since earnings the stock also got positive news that it would be added to the S&amp;P Small Cap 600.The TechnicalsThe stock started to gain traction in 2020, slowly moving off the COVID lows and closing out the year with almost a 100% gain. In 2021 the stock broke out and closed the year up about 250%.Like most tech in 2022, the stock initially took a big hit and dropped 50% in the first month of the year. But from there, the series of earnings beats fueled the stock back to all-time highs and beyond.CLFD hit an August and 2022 high of $130.01 to put the stock up over 50% on the year. This while most stocks suffered their worst performance in a decade.The recent market sell-off brough too much selling pressure and the CLFD fell back under the $100 level.This move lower broke the 50-day moving average, but there are still many support areas that bulls should eye.The $91 level is the 50% retracement from June lows to August highs. $82.25 is the 61.8% retrace from that same setup. And if the market were to severely weaken, bulls might get lucky enough to get the 200-day moving average, which is way down at $72.Bottom LineClearfield has shown investors relative strength all year, so the current pullback should be viewed as a buying opportunity.I would expect the current support levels to hold and for the stock to gain some momentum back into the end of the year. If the market can rally into Q4 and Clearfield earnings can impress again, look for CLFD bulls to shoot for those all-time highs.Bear of the Day:PVH is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates as a global apparel company. PVH specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags, and related products.The stock has had a rough year, down almost 50% in 2022. As PVH continues to fall to levels not seen since the height of the pandemic, investors might be tempted to buy.But the company recently cut their guidance for the year, which has forced analysts to cut estimates. Investors might want to be patient with this name until earnings start to improve.About the CompanyPVH is headquartered in New York, NY. The company was founded in 1881 and employs 19,000.The company's portfolio includes its owned and licensed brands. PVH Corp’s owned brands comprise Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga and Geoffrey Beene. Its licensed brands include Speedo, Kenneth Cole New York, Michael Kors, Kenneth Cole Reaction, Unlisted, a Kenneth Cole Production, Michael Kors Collection, DKNY and Chaps.PVH is valued at $3.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 7. The company holds Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value, but a “C” in Growth and Momentum. The stock pays out a dividend of 0.3%.Q2 EarningsIn late August the company reported EPS, beating expectations by 3%. Q2 came in at $2.08 v the $2.01 expected, but revenues came in light at $2.13B v the $2.23B expected.The company cut their Q3 guidance to a range of $2.10-2.15 v the $2.94 expected. They see revenues down 5-4% year over year.PVH also cut FY22 EPS to $8.00 v the $8.81 expected. They see FY22 operating margin down 9% and inventory up 19% year over year.EstimatesAnalysts have slashed estimates since the EPS guide lowered. Over the last 30 days, there has been a big move lower in the numbers.For the current quarter, estimates have dropped from $2.94 to $2.21, or 25%. For next quarter, we see a 19% drop, from $2.08 to $1.67. The current year dropped 10%, from $8.80 to $7.89.Next year the trouble continues, with estimates falling to $10.30 from $8.61, or 16%.With estimates going lower, price targets are dropping as well. BMO cut their price target to $79 from 88, while JPMorgan Chase went to $75 from $90.Technical TakeThe stock is bleeding lower and has been all year. After starting the year near the $110 mark, PVH is trading at $55.The stock has not been able to get above and hold the 50-day moving average. The 200-day MA is way up at $77.50 and PVH has not traded that level since January 2022.The stock is trading at levels not seen since July of 2020. This was during the pandemic and before the vaccines, so clearly something is wrong with this chart.The stock will likely break the $50 area and then the bears will go hunting for the July 2020 lows around $42. If bulls must buy, that area might be the spot.In SummaryIt is a rough time for some retail as margins fall and inventories build. This atmosphere could last a while, so investors should put their patience over their FOMO in regards to this stock.Additional content:Energy Market Remains Volatile: 3 Low-Beta Stocks to WatchBroad inflationary pressures are increasing. Investors now expect the Federal Reserve to keep raising rates aggressively, thereby increasing fears of recession and spurring market volatility. The energy sector is known for its volatile business scenario, and a slowdown in economic activities could significantly dent energy fuel demand.Companies belonging to the sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by the scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data is per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to keep their eyes on low-beta energy stocks like Chesapeake Energy Corp., Shell plc and Repsol SA.Understanding of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset compared to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security’s price movement relative to the market.If a stock has a beta of 1, then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1.For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with a beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20%, the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating.3 Energy Stocks to GainWe have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks that are not as volatile as the broader market, reflecting that beta for all the stocks lies between 0 and 0.7. One of the stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while another two stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chesapeake Energy Corp.: Chesapeake Energy is a premium natural gas operator and is well-positioned to gain from the significant improvement in gas prices in the past year. In the prolific gas-rich Marcellus shale play, CHK’s operation spreads across roughly 650,000 net acres, where an average of four to five rigs will be operating this year.Chesapeake Energy also has a strong presence in Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale play, making the production outlook bright. Overall, being a leading upstream energy player, CHK has more than 15 years of inventory, signifying more than 2,200 gas locations. #1 Ranked CHK has a strong focus on returning capital to shareholders, as reflected in June 2022.It has doubled its buyback program to up to $2 billion in an aggregate value of its common stock from the prior $1 billion. The program will possibly continue through year-end 2023. Stockholders are also getting rewarded through lucrative dividend payments, as reflected in the announcement of a base dividend increment of 10% to $2.20 per share annually.Shell plc: Shell has a strong upstream portfolio across the world with key projects under construction that will start in 2022 through 2023, and some will probably begin operating beyond 2024. Shell is also leading energy transitions, as reflected in its ambitious plan of setting up a net zero-emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past seven days, the stock, with Zacks Rank of 3, has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2022 and 2023, respectively.Repsol SA: Having a strong focus on allocating capital toward core and more profitable oil and gas resources, Repsol completed additional investments in Marcellus. This year, the company completed its divestments and exit from nations like Malaysia, Russia, Greece and Ecuador. Repsol is a leader in energy transition with a goal of becoming a net zero emissions company by 2050. For 2022, Zacks #3 Ranked firm is likely to see earnings growth of 119.8%.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova is here with the latest on what seemed to be a rather contentious day, as we usually expect with the bank CEOs on Capitol Hill.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Dave. Well, these testimonies got lost in the chaos of today's Fed decision and Putin's warning, of course. But there were some incredibly interesting exchanges between congressional leaders and these CEOs. The questioning was on a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, racial inequities, particularly in their lending practices, overdraft fees, and many other items.And while these hearings hardly ever result in any kind of legislative action, it is incredibly consequential for these CEOs to be put on the spot and grilled by congressional members. Some of the takeaways were remarks from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Again, he was talking about the Federal Reserve possibly still achieving a soft landing, but warning lawmakers that they should be prepared for the worst. Somewhat of a similar warning from Citibank's Jane Fraser. She said that we're going to be in for tough times ahead.And notable also was a very heated exchange between California Congressman Brad Sherman and Jamie Dimon. And Sherman questioned Dimon and Fraser about whether they still have any stakes in Russian oil companies, to which they appeared to respond with some hesitation. And things didn't go well for Dimon when he tried to add on to the conversation. Let's take a listen.- Let me go on to Citigroup. Have you cut your ties with Lukoil and Vitol?JAMIE DIMON: He said one other thing. I don't think--- Not on my time, you can.JAMIE DIMON: No one is doing--- Reclaiming my time, Mr. Dimon.- The time belongs to the gentleman from California.Story continues- You can do a press conference afterwards and comment as you like, not on my time.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Quite contentious there. There was also a lot of discussion on the geopolitical front. Jamie Dimon said that the biggest threat to US financial stability are China and Ukraine, speaking in terms of the escalating economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, but also talking about the possibility of China taking military action against Taiwan. The bank execs were asked if they would pull investments in China if that happened, and they said that they would follow government guidelines on that.And also separately, there were discussions about competing with Chinese banks. And Jamie Dimon said that it's very important that America maintains financial supremacy. And again, these discussions are still underway. We have a second day of hearings tomorrow with a lot to be addressed.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and it was an interesting dichotomy. It's more evidence that it used to be along party lines. Democrats would hammer away at the bank CEOs, and Republicans were largely supportive. That was not the case today. We've seen that pivot, and in particular, with ENG and things-- ESG, excuse me. That narrative is definitely changing with the GOP. Alexandra Semenova, great stuff. I can't believe somebody talked to Jamie Dimon that way, but it is entertaining. Rachelle.]"
33,3e4081ff-ff82-331b-bdb1-20dc37cf832c,USB,2022-09-22,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 68%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-favorite-120033649.html,1663761633,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[If you want to know who really controls U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 68% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$123m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in U.S. Bancorp. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 8.1% of U.S. Bancorp stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

35,0c431334-aa69-39a5-8f81-60c4717e8666,CTAS,2022-09-22,Cintas (CTAS) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-ctas-earnings-expected-grow-140002963.html,1663768802,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Cintas (CTAS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis uniform rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.08 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cintas?For Cintas, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cintas will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cintas would post earnings of $2.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.81, delivering a surprise of +4.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cintas doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fears of a recession, excess inventory and continued bottleneck tie-ups are causing many retailers — especially those that cater to budget shoppers — to rethink their go-forward strategies.Target offers drive-up services. Courtesy PhotoRevenues at both Target and Walmart fell in the most recent quarter because of macro headwinds. One of the many issues plaguing the retail industry at large is a continued shortage of available labor to work in stores in fulfillment centers. But Walmart chief executive officer Doug McMillon surprised analysts in May when he said during the company’s conference call that the firm actually hired too many people — at least in stores — during last December’s Omicron surge. Then in August, Walmart laid off roughly 200 people among its corporate workforce.Jimmy Carter, a Walmart spokesperson, said at the time that Walmart was evolving its workforce to accommodate the changing customers’ needs and had plans to offer more jobs in areas such as e-commerce, technology, health and wellness, supply chain and advertising sales.Story continuesTarget, meanwhile, seems to be pivoting in the opposite direction, with plans to hire about the same number of seasonal employees as last year — even as inventory issues cut profits by nearly 90 percent last quarter. The big-box retailer also ended the quarter with roughly $6 billion more in inventory, compared with pre-pandemic levels.But the firm seems to be tackling the excess inventory by offering extended promotions.Target Deal Days starts Oct. 6 through 8 and offers guests access to “deep holiday deals on must-have items and everyday essentials.” The retailer will also have an extended holiday price-match guarantee period from Oct. 6 through Dec. 24.The retailer is hoping to attract new talent in its stores and supply chain facilities by offering a starting wage between $15 and $24 an hour, in addition to flexible schedules, “well-being benefits” and employee discounts.To lure in more shoppers, Target continues to offer services for convenience (such as same-day delivery and BOPIS) and continues to double down on its effort to establish itself as a fashion destination with a combination of owned brands, national brands and exclusive product launches.Most recently, Target revealed its Fall Designer Collection, a limited-time partnership with luxury and high-end designers, creating affordable capsules for Target.Pieces from the Tabitha Brown for Target collection. Courtesy PhotoThe Minneapolis-based retailer also carries 18 of its owned apparel brands, in addition to national brands — such as Levi’s Red Tab, lingerie brand Journelle, period-panties brand Thinx and Priyanka Chopra’s hair care brand Anomaly — and Ulta Beauty, Disney and Apple shops-in-shop in select stores.“Throughout the season, guests will discover new and differentiated items for gifting and gathering, including only-at-Target owned brands and must-have national brands and they can expect great deals and everyday low prices at every turn for an unmatched holiday shopping experience,” Hennington said.]"

While this included some seasonal staff, those hires were mostly in full-time, year-round positions to cover COVID-19 absences. That led to overstaffing that dented Walmart's profits in the first quarter of 2022.This year's hiring is expected to bolster the company's online business and its in-store, delivery and pickup operations ahead of what is expected to be a subdued holiday shopping season. U.S. retailers face inflation, higher interest rates, a tight job market and supply chain snarls.Walmart's new workers this year will include seasonal U.S. store associates, truck drivers in full-time positions and service staff at call centers, Waggoner said.Amazon.com, Target, Macy's and Kohl's have not yet announced their holiday hiring plans.Holiday retail sales are expected to rise between 4% and 6% year over year from November to January for total sales of about $1.45 trillion to $1.47 trillion, according to Deloitte's annual holiday retail forecast released on Sept. 13.This compares with the 15.1% sales growth in the same period last year, when shoppers were flush with cash and eager to spend after months under lockdown.Declining demand for durable consumer goods, which had been the centerpiece of pandemic spending, will be a factor this year. Deloitte said inflation may boost total dollar sales but volumes will not rise commensurately.For example, 5% fewer online orders are expected this year compared with last year, as prices are expected to jump 15%, data from Salesforce's Consumer Sentiment Index in August showed.Story continuesHoliday shopping is also expected to start earlier than ever this year as ""stretched wallets create urgency,"" Salesforce said in its report.Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette echoed those comments, saying he expects holiday shopping to start in October.For example, Melanie Edwards of Detroit is planning to shop for her family this month, two months earlier than when she started last year.""With inflation not seeming to decline, I’m planning on shopping extra early this year. If I spot a deal before November, I'm going to jump on it,"" said Edwards, who works as a product manager at a soda company.Target, for example, is already advertising Christmas as a featured shopping category on its home page, where shoppers can find a small amount of holiday deals, deals tracking website Blackfriday.com said.At least three analysts told Reuters that Amazon's rumored https://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-prime-day-2-has-leaked-and-its-coming-later-in-the-year second Prime Day of 2022, likely to be held in mid-October, will unofficially kick off this year's holiday season. The first was held in July.Prime Days usually prompt rivals to offer their own deals and achieve a doubling in their online sales on that day, which is similar to what they achieve on Cyber Monday, a key day in the beginning of the traditional holiday shopping season, they said.

Only the Nordstrom family owns more shares, with roughly 30 percent of the company stock. Insiders, a group that would include the Nordstrom family, own about 40 percent of the stock.However, Nordstrom said Tuesday that the plan “has not been adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of the company, and is not intended to deter offers that are fair and otherwise in the best interests of all Nordstrom shareholders.”In 2018, the Nordstrom family offered to buy shares at $50 each but the board rejected the offer. The stock is currently trading between $19 and $20 a share.Here’s how the plan works: Nordstrom will issue, by means of a dividend, one common stock right for each outstanding share of Nordstrom common stock to shareholders of record on the close of business on Sept. 30. Initially, these rights will not be exercisable and will trade with, and be represented by, the shares of Nordstrom common stock.Story continuesThe rights plan is effective immediately and has a one-year duration, expiring Sept. 19, 2023.The rights generally become exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 10 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Nordstrom common stock in a transaction not approved by the Nordstrom board. In that situation, each holder of a right (other than the acquiring person, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) will be entitled to purchase, at the exercise price, additional shares of Nordstrom common stock at a 50 percent discount to the then-current market price.In addition, if Nordstrom is acquired in a merger or other business combination after an unapproved party acquires more than 10 percent of the outstanding shares of Nordstrom common stock, each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company’s stock at a 50 percent discount. The board could exchange rights (other than rights owned by the acquiring person that have become void) at a ratio of one share of Nordstrom common stock per outstanding right, subject to adjustment. Except as provided in the rights plan, the board is entitled to redeem the rights at $0.001 per right.If a person or group — including the members of the Nordstrom family, who will be deemed to be a group purely for purposes of the rights plan — beneficially owns 10 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Nordstrom common stock prior to Nordstrom’s announcement of its adoption of the rights plan, then that person’s or group’s existing ownership percentage will be grandfathered, although, with certain exceptions, the rights will become exercisable if at any time after the announcement of the adoption of the rights plan such person or group increases its ownership of Nordstrom common stock by more than 0.1 percent of outstanding common stock.Morgan Stanley is serving as financial adviser to Nordstrom, and Sidley Austin LLP is serving as the company’s legal adviser.]"

The move — believed to be a first-of-its-kind in the financial services industry — is part of Marsh’s commitment to help accelerate the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and to recognize clients pursuing and exceeding net zero carbon emission goals.Under the payment program, US Marsh clients can opt to pay for US insurance broking or risk advisory services by transferring agreed upon voluntary carbon offset credits and RECs to leading banking institution Bank of America, which has extensive experience with carbon markets, via a registry account. After receiving the credits and certificates, Bank of America will send the proceeds to Marsh.""The insurance industry has a central role to play in enabling firms to achieve the climate goals set at COP26,"" said Pat Donnelly, President, US and Canada, Marsh. ""Marsh’s new carbon credit payment program demonstrates how investing in strong ESG frameworks can result in tangible benefits and complements other Marsh initiatives such as our ESG Risk Rating tool, which enables organizations to measure their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Being able to pay for Marsh’s services and solutions with these credits and certificates is a benefit for our clients seeking to preserve cash and provides another incentive to invest in carbon removal and avoidance projects.""Paul Murray, a Senior Vice President in Marsh’s financial and professional liability (FINPRO) Practice, which developed the program, added: ""Many companies currently make use of voluntary carbon offset credits and RECs as a part of their overall sustainability goals. With the recent passage of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a number of incentives to spur the expansion of clean energy, we expect the use of credits and RECs to increase significantly.""Story continuesVoluntary carbon offset credits are records of investments organizations make in environmental projects and infrastructure that either remove carbon dioxide (CO2) or avoid the emission of CO2. Each offset represents the successful, verified removal or avoidance of one ton of CO2.RECs are records of renewable electricity generation and are issued to organizations when one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity is generated and delivered to the electricity grid from a renewable energy resource.About MarshMarsh is the world’s leading insurance broker and risk advisor.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 36%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 132% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 5.7% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.In light of this, it's alarming that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

58,02521bd5-b21a-3c55-b21d-1db57b976996,XYL,2022-09-22,7 Water Stocks With the Highest Dividends to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-water-stocks-highest-dividends-174231884.html,1663522951,STORY,"['AOS', 'AWR', 'XYL', 'MLI', 'WTRG', 'AWK', 'GRC']","[In this article, I’ll be looking at some water stocks with dividends. These stocks don’t have the highest dividends in the market, but they offer among the highest payouts in the sector.Aside from water stocks’ dividends, however, there are several reasons to consider investing in the sector. To begin with, water is a commodity that will always be needed. This is particularly true because water crises are emerging in several countries, including the United States. In several Western states, a multi-year drought may necessitate government restricting water use by up to 25%.And like many commodity stocks, a key reason to invest in water stocks is their reliable dividends. In volatile markets, it’s always a good idea to invest in companies that pay you to own their stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd then, there’s the current “risk-off” environment. In light of all of these factors, you can see why water stocks with dividends are in a sweet spot between growth and value. Many of these stocks are outperforming the market simply because of the laws of supply and demand.So if you’re looking for some income during your retirement or you just want to find some stocks to combat the market’s current volatility, here are seven water stocks that are worth a look.AWKAmerican Water Works$148.40WTRGEssential Utilities$45.57AWRAmerican States Water Company$85.79MLIMueller Industries$59.67GRCGorman-Rupp$25.43AOSA.O. Smith$51.72XYLXylem$93.26American Water Works (AWK)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockWhen investors look for water stocks with dividends, utilities are a good place to start. American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is one of the leading water utilities in the country. The company’s current dividend yield is 1.77%.That’s not particularly impressive, but it’s good.The company currently pays its stock’s owners $2.62 per share on an annual basis. That’s 44% higher than the sector average.Story continuesAnd when it comes to the balance sheet, there’s a lot to like as well. The company has a profit margin of 3.99% which is almost twice the sector’s average. And with a price–earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 20 times, the valuation of AWK stock is becoming more attractive.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comThe next company on my list is not a pure-play water utility. That’s because, in addition to the water services that it provides through municipalities and other parties, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) also has exposure to the natural gas sector. That adds some volatility to WTRG stock, but it’s still one of the best names for income-oriented investors.The company pays $1.15 per share of dividends annually. That currently equates to a 2.5% dividend yield. Indicating that the company’s dividend is safe, WTRG is in the exclusive Dividend Aristocrat club, as  it has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years.And at a time when investors are looking for growth wherever they can get it, Essential Utilities is a solid choice. The company’s balance sheet is sound, and it continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth.In fact, over the next five years, Essential Utilities is projecting high single-digit-percentage growth in both metrics. That’s a combination that should allow Essential Utilities to continue increasing its dividend over time.American States Water Company (AWR)Several new gray valves, for water or gas, lie on the floor at the factory. The valves are gray for water or gas at the factory of the manufacturerSource: Dmitrii Pridannikov / Shutterstock.comAnother utility company on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends is American States Water Company (NYSE:AWR). About 25% of its customer base is in California. Specifically, the company serves over 250,000 customers in the Golden State, making it one of the state’s largest water utility companies.AWR stock has advanced at an average annual rate of approximately 15% over the last five years. And as of the market close on September 15, the stock was up 21% since bottoming in June.The company is projecting single-digit-percentage revenue and earnings growth over the next five years. That should be enough to satisfy dividend investors.American States Water is a Dividend King that has increased its payout for the last 62 consecutive years. And there’s little reason to believe that the streak will be interrupted.Mueller Industries (MLI)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comIf investing in a company that is undervalued but growing appeals to you, you’ll love my next stock. Mueller Industries (NASDAQ:MLI) is the first water stock on this list that is not a water utility. However, the company is vital to water infrastructure. The company makes pipes, valves, and fittings for commercial and residential applications.In its most recent reported quarter, Mueller generated record revenue of $1.15 billion. And the company reported a healthy backlog. Meanwhile, its balance sheet is more than fine, as it has zero net debt and continues to increase its free cash flow.Also making the shares attractive is that investors can still buy MLI stock at an attractive P/E ratio of just over five times earnings. Plus, the company pays an annual dividend of $1.00 and has increased its dividend by approximately 9% annually over the last three years.Gorman-Rupp (GRC)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comLike many companies in this sector, Gorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC) is an established name. The company has been making pumps and pumping systems for its customers since 1933. And today, the firm has a global presence as it generates about one-third of its revenue outside the United States.About 58% of the company’s revenue comes from water and water-related products. Investors can count on the specialized firm to generate steady revenue and earnings . Throughout its history, Gorman-Rupp has grown through acquisition, but that hasn’t stopped it from issuing dividends for the last 72 years.That payout by itself would make the stock worth including on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends. However, for the last 49 years, Gorman-Rupp has increased its dividend, putting it on the cusp of being a Payout King.A.O. Smith (AOS)A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comA.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) is one of the country’s leading manufacturers of boilers, water treatment products and water heaters. In June 2022, InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth gave AOS stock a ringing endorsement, calling it one of his favorite stocks to buy.At that time, the company had just acquired Atlantic Filter Corporation. The water treatment company was A.O. Smith’s fifth such acquisition since 2016. Water treatment is becoming a key niche, and A.O. Smith appears to be committed to grabbing a substantial share of the market.AOS  has some work to do. That may be why the company is looking to grow its water heater business in China and India.  In the meantime, investors can enjoy the company’s dividend which pays out $1.12 on an annual basis. That works out to a yield of 2.17%.Xylem (XYL)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockThe last stock on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends is a company that’s using technology to address the emerging issue of water scarcity. Xylem (NYSE:XYL) claims that within the next three years, 1.8 billion people will be living in areas without sufficient water.To that end, the company delivers hundreds of innovative and smart technology solutions. The company specializes in fixing leaky pipes.While that may sound unimportant, it’s becoming  an increasingly prevalent problem because of our country’s aging water infrastructure. In fact, the average water main in the U. S. hasn’t been replaced since the 1970s.XYL stock is down 21% for the year, but it’s been rallying since June. As of September 15, 2022 XYL has posted a 29% gain.The company’s revenue should remain solid as the nation upgrades its aging infrastructure. Consequently expect Xylem’s dividend to continue to increase.  It currently pays the owners of XYL $1.20 annually, and the payout has been growing at an average rate of 10% over the last three years.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

WYNN and Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD.Industry: GamingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1982982/3-gaming-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-challengesThe Zacks Gaming industry is gradually recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. Although the industry is benefiting from improving visitation in Las Vegas, dismal visitation in Macau is hurting it. The Macau recovery remains slow and it is still unclear when the market will return to its pre-pandemic level. However, robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry. Stocks like MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts, Ltd. and Boyd Gaming Corp. are likely to gain traction from this upbeat demand.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Gaming industry includes companies, which primarily own and operate integrated casinos, hotels and entertainment resorts. Some industry players also deliver technology products and services across lotteries, electronic gaming machines, sports betting and interactive gaming. Some industry participants further develop and operate gaming establishments as well as associated lodging, restaurant, horse racing and entertainment amenities.Some companies are also involved in developing and selling gaming applications. Additionally, e-sport or sporting event or tournament services, content management system, video software, mobile applications and e-sports data platform solutions are provided.Key Themes Shaping the Gaming IndustryVisitation Still Below Pre-Pandemic Level: Traffic persists as a major concern for the gaming industry since the coronavirus pandemic. However, the industry is gradually coming out of the woods despite a dismal performance in Macau still hurting the industry. Easing of local COVID-related restrictions helped gross gaming revenue (GGR) to rebound in August to $271 million compared with $49 million recorded in July. However, the figure was well below the August 2019 figure of $3 billion and also down 50.7% year over year.Story continuesFor the first eight months of 2022, Macau’s GGR declined 53.4% year over year and 85.4% compared with the same period in 2019. In 2021, Macau casinos’ performance was better than the 2020 reading but still well below the pre-pandemic level. In 2021, Macau’s gross gaming revenue (GGR) totaled $10.82 billion, up nearly 44% year over year. However, the 2021 annual figure was still 70% below the pre-pandemic tally.

Although the industry is benefiting from improving visitation in Las Vegas, dismal visitation in Macau is hurting it. The Macau recovery remains slow and it is still unclear when the market will return to its pre-pandemic level. However, robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry. Stocks like MGM Resorts International MGM, Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN and Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD are likely to gain traction from this upbeat demand.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Gaming industry includes companies, which primarily own and operate integrated casinos, hotels and entertainment resorts. Some industry players also deliver technology products and services across lotteries, electronic gaming machines, sports betting and interactive gaming. Some industry participants further develop and operate gaming establishments as well as associated lodging, restaurant, horse racing and entertainment amenities. Some companies are also involved in developing and selling gaming applications. Additionally, e-sport or sporting event or tournament services, content management system, video software, mobile applications and e-sports data platform solutions are provided.Key Themes Shaping the Gaming IndustryVisitation Still Below Pre-Pandemic Level: Traffic persists as a major concern for the gaming industry since the coronavirus pandemic. However, the industry is gradually coming out of the woods despite a dismal performance in Macau still hurting the industry. Easing of local COVID-related restrictions helped gross gaming revenue (GGR) to rebound in August to $271 million compared with $49 million recorded in July. However, the figure was well below the August 2019 figure of $3 billion and also down 50.7% year over year. For the first eight months of 2022, Macau’s GGR declined 53.4% year over year and 85.4% compared with the same period in 2019. In 2021, Macau casinos’ performance was better than the 2020 reading but still well below the pre-pandemic level. In 2021, Macau’s gross gaming revenue (GGR) totaled $10.82 billion, up nearly 44% year over year. However, the 2021 annual figure was still 70% below the pre-pandemic tally. Notably, companies continue to focus on the level of services and staffing with selective amenities, and enhanced safety and social-distancing protocols in the gaming floor to welcome gamers.U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenues Make Record: The gaming industry in the United States is recovering faster than anticipated.

And we're watching casino stocks that are mostly in the green, as China drafts rules to make it easier for some foreigners to enter China for visits along the border to tourism sites. Now, Caesars is the outlier here, I'm pretty sure because Caesars doesn't have a business in Macau, right? Caesars is just US. So that's why it is not benefiting from this lift that the others that do have strong Macau businesses are seeing here.And we're also hearing that Hong Kong is gonna end some of its COVID restrictions, like mandatory hotel quarantine. So that also could be helping matters. By the way, Wynn got a big boost yesterday after Credit Suisse reinstated its coverage of the stock with an outperform rating. So this is day two of this little casino rally we're seeing.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it absolutely goes to show the importance for these companies of making sure that tourism, especially in some of the areas where-- and for the players that are more internationally-focused, where there is a reliable name that a tourist would see in a place such as China and in Macau, particularly, where they might go to say, you know what? I know that experience.And that particularly is what investors would look at to see exactly where that kind of globalization effort that's been pushed forward by some of the casino operators over years now is set to pay off and benefit them, because of that name recognition, that brand equity. And so with that in mind, you're seeing potentially even more of the reopening.And especially in China. This is such a key growth area for a lot of the casinos as well in ensuring that they can actually monetize on tourism as that is starting to be able to have a clearer pathway to come back into the region.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, in the case of a Wynn, for example, 40% of its sales come from Macau, specifically. And that analysts over at Credit Suisse said yesterday, that Macau sentiment was near a bottom. So if we start to see some reopening in China that could certainly help benefit that business.]"

They've got a price target boost by Barclays. That was the first one. $14 to $16. Now, that's their new price target.But the good news doesn't stop there. That was just the first one. Truist Securities upgrading Norwegian Cruise Line to buy from hold as booking volumes and pricing for luxury lines improve. They're seeing a look at shares moving higher by about 2% here early in the trading session.And for the cruise line operators, they've been looking for more of the-- I don't want to say red tape, but more of the precautions to continue to be eased, especially here in the US but even more broadly on some of the destinations that they are going into it as well, because that has been so key to being able to disembark from the voyage safely and get back on, and mitigate the risk for Norwegian Royal Caribbean and Carnival of any type of transmission of virus or illness on board.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and I have to cop to not knowing that Norwegian was sort of at the upper end of the market, right? But what's interesting here is that these analysts are talking about that luxury-- what we're seeing in luxury demand for cruises-- is mirroring what we're seeing in retail, for example. What we've been hearing recently from some of the higher end retailers that they are still seeing strength.The analysts over at Truist specifically citing some figures here, saying that bookings have moderated to up mingles-- midsingle digits compared with 2019. But that's still, quote-unquote, materially stronger than the decline that we saw in June and July of 10% to 15%. So it's all relative. But on a relative basis, these guys are seeing better numbers.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, the thesis is interesting because it certainly looks at or tries to draw a corollary between what we've seen in the high-income consumer on the retail front even, and apply that to a service business within Norwegian. And sure, yeah, there's the same appetite in terms of what we've seen in the shift of spending from goods to services over the course of the summer, there is some cyclicality to that.Story continuesBut now it comes down to-- for all of these cruise line operators, but especially if you're going to make that thesis for Norwegian then it comes down to how much those bookings are gonna continuously improve in a period where people are, all right, looking towards the end of the year. Thinking about holiday shopping, spending like that. And perhaps maybe doing some early bookings for next year even.And I guess that's where we'll have to see where Norwegian are starting to see some of those bookings and the campaigns that they've run to re-engage with so much of this really committed and enthusiastic cruise line consortium of customers, because I think that's perhaps in the experience economy, one of the most loyal type of consumers that's out there in the [? experience ?] [? kind. ?]JULIE HYMAN: It certainly seems that way. And then they got to buy the resort wear as well to--BRAD SMITH: Oh.JULIE HYMAN: --go on the cruise.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Maybe that'll hold up well. I don't know, we'll see.]"

The entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to the macro-economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions.onsemi has been able to beat the cyclical downtrend as investors show bullish sentiments regarding the stock. It has been investing in strategic areas like intelligent power and sensing. onsemi has been investing heavily in building its intelligent power and sensing products to help address key high-growth megatrends in automotive, industrial and plug power.In the second quarter, despite ongoing market volatility, onsemi reported that automotive and industrial revenue accounted for 66% of its overall business and combined grew 38% year over year. This was driven by the adoption of intelligent power and sensing solutions in the markets like automotive due to the electric vehicle (EV) megatrend.onsemi’s investments in intelligent power and sensing reflect the company’s strategy to provide differentiated and varied solutions to its customers to drive top-line growth. ON is reallocating its focus to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate the price-to-value discrepancies.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Diversifying Product Portfolio to Drive Top Lineonsemi recently announced that it has approved an exit plan to close one of its divisions in the advanced solutions group segment to further enable the company to direct its investments to high-growth margin business segments.The unit is generally associated with the Quantenna business division, which the company acquired in 2019. Slow growth for the Quantenna business segment products has stunted the analog solutions group revenues. In the second quarter of 2022, advanced solutions group or ASG revenues of $716.7 million (34.4% of revenues) increased 4% on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesThis news comes after onsemi’s announcement that it is expanding its silicon carbide (SiC) facility in Hudson, NH. The newly inaugurated hub will increase ON’s SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year and address certain supply-chain bottlenecks.This will aid in fully controlling onsemi’s SiC manufacturing supply chain, from sourcing silicon carbide powder and graphite raw material to delivering fully packaged SiC devices.onsemi’s recent expansion of its Hudson facility will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure and is an important contributor to decarbonization. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Further positively impacting onsemi’s decision to diversify its product portfolio and expand operations is President Biden's decision to the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China. Onsemi peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The recent declaration by the government will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from the likes of Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will aid EV makers in achieving faster charging and help reduce EV weight. This helps STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.However, onsemi which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects demand to continue outpacing supply throughout 2022.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Microchip Technology’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology What's The Opportunity In Microchip Technology?Good news, investors! Microchip Technology is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $104.56, but it is currently trading at US$66.89 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Microchip Technology’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Microchip Technology look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 63% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microchip Technology. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MCHP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MCHP for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MCHP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

The SEC said in a statement that Morgan Stanley’s “extensive failures” had put around 15 million customers’ personal data at risk.“Customers entrust their personal information to financial professionals with the understanding and expectation that it will be protected, and [Morgan Stanley] fell woefully short in doing so,” Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, said in the statement.Litany of 'astonishing' mistakesThe litany of failures the SEC discovered during the investigation were, in the words of Grewel, “astonishing.”On multiple occasions dating back to 2015, it was found that the bank hired a moving and storage company with no experience or expertise in data destruction to decommission hard drives and servers containing millions of customers’ PII.Morgan Stanley failed to properly monitor the moving company’s work, the SEC said—and the moving company went on to sell thousands of Morgan Stanley devices that were storing PII.Those devices were eventually resold, complete with the data, in an online auction.Morgan Stanley had managed to recoup some of the devices, which contained thousands of pieces of unencrypted customer data, but the SEC said the company had failed to recover the vast majority of its improperly disposed hardware.The devices had been equipped with encryption software, but the software had never been activated.In 2017—a year after the completion of the data center decommissioning project—an Oklahoma IT consultant emailed Morgan Stanley to inform the bank he had purchased a hard drives online that were full of the company’s data.Story continues“You are a major financial institution and should be following some very stringent guidelines on how to deal with retiring hardware,” the consultant said in the email. “Or at the very least getting some kind of verification of data destruction from the vendors you sell equipment to.”Morgan Stanley repurchased the hard drives from the consultant.‘Disastrous consequences’ for investors“If not properly safeguarded, this sensitive information can end up in the wrong hands and have disastrous consequences for investors,"" the SEC's Grewel said. ""Today’s action sends a clear message to financial institutions that they must take seriously their obligation to safeguard such data.”Morgan Stanley consented to pay $35 million to the SEC without admitting or denying the organization’s charges.“We are pleased to be resolving this matter,” a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told Fortune on Wednesday. “We have previously notified applicable clients regarding these matters, which occurred several years ago, and have not detected any unauthorized access to, or misuse of, personal client information.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

By the end of trading that week, FedEx's share price had slid more than 28% from where it was on Subramaniam's first day as CEO as investors questioned FedEx's forecasting ability.""You can't say things are good, give guidance, raise the dividend, and then blow shareholders to smithereens,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.FedEx said it would discuss the global economic outlook and results for the quarter ended Aug. 31 in a conference call after the market closes on Thursday.Reuters spoke with Bradshaw and five other investors who bought FedEx stock when it looked cheap versus its more profitable and better performing rival United Parcel Service, believing a FedEx business revamp promised healthy returns. Achieving that vision now seems further out than they had hoped.Most of those investors, including one who sold most of his holdings in January, still believe FedEx can eventually generate higher profits by shedding assets, slashing costs and combining its independently operated Express and Ground businesses.But patience is wearing thin, especially after UPS executives stood by their own forecasts this month.Asked if last week's warning shook his confidence in FedEx's new CEO, Bradshaw said, ""100%. I wish I would have owned more UPS and forgot FedEx."" Bradshaw said the firm holds roughly 15,000 shares across accounts.Story continues'SO BAD, IT'S GOOD'Investors agree business conditions are deteriorating due to softer e-commerce demand, soaring inflation and on-and-off COVID lockdowns in China. But most believe FedEx's pain has been mostly self-inflicted, noting it failed to ground planes, shutter corporate offices and reduce unneeded labor hours fast enough to offset the downturn.""The decline in profitability doesn't reconcile with the more modest shortfall in revenues. The numbers don't fully add up,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in White Plains, New York, which holds about 58,000 FedEx shares.Katz remains confident in FedEx long-term, but he and other investors want to hear executives on Thursday detail what went wrong and how they will set things right.Analysts and investors have focused on the deterioration at FedEx Express, where a deflating pandemic e-commerce bubble has hammered demand for lucrative air shipments to the United States from Asia, a business where the company has a larger footprint than UPS.When FedEx said last week that first-quarter Express revenue would decline $500 million, Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra estimated that translated to a similar drop in profit. He said in a research note that the one-for-one decline implied a ""concerning inability"" to manage expenses.The silver lining was that the news clarified FedEx's challenges. ""'It's 'so bad, it's good', with respect to making it even clearer that a much more dramatic overhaul is needed,"" Mehrotra said.FedEx also said last week that it struggled with Express service challenges in Europe, where its costly and trouble-plagued TNT integration is stretching into its seventh year since the deal closed in 2016.FedEx warned business conditions would worsen in the current quarter, which ends as the key Christmas package delivery season begins. Warnings from FedEx and others in the global cargo market have cast a pall over the year-end holiday shopping season.FedEx said first-quarter revenue at its U.S. Ground delivery business would miss company targets by $300 million. Last year, the company overestimated growth for the 2021 Christmas season, damaging relations with independent delivery contractors and leaving investors wondering whether FedEx can effectively model demand.Late last month, FedEx told Reuters it was confident in its ""stress tested"" holiday forecast for this year.Trip Miller, managing director at Memphis-based hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, said he did not blame FedEx for its missteps, but locked in profits by selling more than 90% of his shares in January as he saw warnings that demand was slipping.""They don't turn this ship fast,"" he said.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Jamie Freed in Sydney; Editing by Ben Klayman and David Gregorio)]"

(NYSE: FE), has installed protective devices on electrical equipment in areas near known bald eagle nests in Hamburg Township and near Culver Lake (Frankford), both in Sussex County.JCP&amp;L Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The protective system includes the use of guards that prevent birds from nesting on top of poles and crossarms and insulated caps that protect any birds that may contact electric equipment. Reflective tags have also been installed along power lines to increase visibility of the lines to birds in flight.""As stewards of our environment, we are committed to protecting wildlife, especially endangered and threatened species like the bald eagle,"" said Amy Ruszala, an environmental scientist and avian expert at FirstEnergy. ""Taking these steps allows the avian population to thrive while enhancing service reliability for customers by reducing outages caused by birds contacting our equipment.""FirstEnergy's environmental team and utility personnel routinely inspect power equipment, like utility poles, substations and transmission towers, for bird nests. When a nest is located on or near electrical equipment, the company works with state and federal wildlife officials to relocate the nest if it poses an immediate threat.Over the past five years, FirstEnergy and its electric companies have completed more than 100 projects to protect birds of prey, like eagles and ospreys. The work includes installing large, wooden nesting platforms or perch arms near electrical equipment where birds prefer to nest or temporarily rest, insulating power lines near perch or nest locations and adding large, bright visual markers on power lines to alert birds to the wires.Additionally, FirstEnergy has implemented the use of drones to complete bird nest inspections and deployed a mobile app that allows utility personnel to report avian issues in real time. These ongoing efforts have helped utility personnel more efficiently identify and respond to bird activity along power lines to help prevent service disruptions and protect wildlife.Story continuesThe New Jersey bald eagle population has soared in recent years, with nests located in all 21 New Jersey counties. According to the most recent NJ Department of Environmental Protection and Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey's annual report, 247 territorial bald eagle pairs were identified statewide in 2021. The population of egg-laying pairs has more than doubled in the past decade, reaching a new high of 222 pairs in 2021, with 296 young eaglets produced. In 1987, surveyors had located just a single active nesting pair of bald eagles in New Jersey.Despite being removed from the federal list of endangered species in 2007, the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife still lists the bald eagle as an endangered species during the breeding season and a threatened species during the non-breeding season.JCP&amp;L serves 1.1 million customers in the counties of Burlington, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren.

(Revised),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-going-fedex-revised-151703814.html,1663773423,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS']","[In a market-moving announcement last week, FedEx FDX withdrew its FY23 earnings forecast, citing a volatile operating environment.The original guidance came just three months ago in June, perhaps raising valid questions about the new management team. It’s important to note that long-time CEO Fred Smith stepped down from his position earlier this year in that same month.Obviously, the announcement has enormous implications.Market participants took the news hard; FedEx shares closed down more than 20% the following trading day.In response, another notable transportation company, United Parcel Service UPS, also experienced adverse price action.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of both companies in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the company already slashing its guidance, it raises a very valid question – what is going on with FedEx?Let’s take a closer look.Preliminary Q1 ResultsThe company forecasts quarterly EPS of $3.33, penciling in a steep 25% decline from year-ago quarterly earnings of $4.37 per share.Revenue is forecasted to come in at $23.2 billion, reflecting a 5.5% Y/Y uptick.The company stated that its Q1 results were heavily affected by global volume softness that picked up in the final weeks of the quarter, which is definitely not a good sign.FedEx’s Express segment was impacted by an overall weak macroeconomic backdrop in Asia and services challenges in Europe, leading to roughly a $500 million revenue shortfall relative to company forecasts.Further, FedEx’s Ground revenue is expected to come in roughly $300 million below company expectations.FedEx stated that it took swift and immediate action to mitigate costs, but operating expenses still remained high relative to overall demand.Raj Subramaniam, CEO of FedEx, says, “Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter, both internationally and in the U.S. We are swiftly addressing these headwinds, but given the speed at which conditions shifted, first quarter results are below our expectations.”Story continuesIn addition, FedEx has laid out many cost initiatives, including a reduction in flight frequencies and temporarily parking aircraft, consolidation of certain sort operations to drive productivity, deferral of staff hiring, and the closure of over 90 FedEx Office locations.To put it simply, FedEx had a rough quarter.TNT Integration HeadachesFlipping the pages back a few years, FedEx acquired TNT Express in May 2016 in a deal valued at $4.8 billion.The acquisition was expected to spur growth across Europe, but the company’s integration has been complicated for FedEx and has cost them millions.FedEx’s Express global air network, paired with TNT’s intra-European road system, was envisioned as a worldwide one-stop shipping hub for European and non-European companies.Further, the acquisition pushed United Parcel Service out of the bidding for TNT, essentially giving them a leg-up on one of its main rivals.Issues surfaced almost immediately.TNT’s information technology and physical infrastructure were reportedly outdated, and the company’s sales were weak around the acquisition time. A shrinking top line was attributed to a sluggish European economy in the decade’s second half and low-income types of freight pushed by TNT.Integration of TNT is still an ongoing headache for FedEx, with the air network finally expected to be fully integrated in 2022.UPS Also In Trouble?While it’s nearly impossible to ignore FedEx’s preliminary quarterly results, it’s important to note that a management shakeup and unfavorable acquisitions are their own problems.UPS reported its quarterly results in late July, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 5% and beating revenue projections by a marginal 0.2%.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company reaffirmed its full-year 2022 financial guidance and even raised targeted share repurchases to a mighty $3 billion for 2022.The company’s average daily volume declined by 4%, attributed to actions taken to optimize overall network volume.Further, in a challenging global market, the company’s operating profit increased to $1.2 billion, and revenue per piece increased by nearly 15%. Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS, says, “While the external environment is ever-changing, our better not bigger strategic framework has fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, enabling greater agility and strong financial performance.”It appears that United Parcel Service’s “better, not bigger” strategy is paying off.Bottom LineAll in all, FedEx has faced many unfavorable dynamics over the last several years, including the poor integration of TNT Express and long-time CEO Fred Smith leaving the company earlier in the year.Now, the company has entirely cut its previous FY23 guidance.On the contrary, United Parcel Service UPS posted a notably strong quarter in its latest print and even reaffirmed its 2022 guidance in the face of harsh business environments.FDX’s recent disheartening guidance surely warrants some concern. However, to put it simply, many of the issues FedEx is facing seem to be their own problems.On another note, it doesn't seem likely that FedEx was caught off guard by any means; geopolitical issues have been prevalent all year, and the Fed started its tightening cycle in the same month the previous guidance was given.Operating issues have been prevalent within FedEx FDX for years.(NOTE: We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

But that doesn't mean deals are off the table.""M&amp;A will definitely be part of our future,"" Taylor told Yahoo Finance Live at the software giant's 20th annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.Taylor explained that Salesforce has been laser-focused on expanding its profit margins to show investors the power of a business model rooted in integrating new companies. He noted that Salesforce aims to reach a 20.4% operating margin this year, in part fueled by deeper integration of previous acquisitions such as Slack, Mulesoft (acquired in 2018), and Tableau (acquired in 2019).Salesforce has an eye toward making more ""shareholder-friendly"" deals in the future, Taylor said. That could help lift Salesforce's stock price.Salesforce shares are down 41% year-to-date compared to a 16% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average as investors fret about the outlook for Big Tech and slowing global economies.Wall Street appears to appreciate Salesforce's more stringent approach to deal-making.""We think Salesforce is moving away from explicitly commenting on M&amp;A so some could read that as negative (i.e. a big deal is brewing),"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne said in a Dreamforce preview note to clients. ""In our view, the company is well aware that a big deal is essentially a credibility killer as to the above statement on margins so we think the odds of something big (i.e. $10bn-$20bn) remain low in the near-term. We think a transaction that is smaller and does not impact the margin expansion (i.e. similar to Vlocity) would not be an issue at these levels.""A man arrives with a bundle of balloons at the Salesforce Tower and Salesforce.com offices in New York City, U.S., March 7, 2019.

It's day two of Dreamforce 2022, the annual conference hosted by cloud company Salesforce. Yahoo Finance's editor-at-large Brian Sozzi sat down with Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor to break down the company's cloud business. And he first asked him about what this event means for the company. Take a listen.BRET TAYLOR: Let me give a little context, especially for your viewers who are not familiar with this Dreamforce thing, is Salesforce is more than a company. We are a community and an economy. IDC estimates that the Salesforce economy is going to be 9.3 million jobs, representing $1.6 trillion of economic impact by 2026. Those are big numbers. Well, this is the centerpiece of the Salesforce economy. So you have trailblazers, our administrators, our developers, all the partners like Snowflake and DocuSign that have built businesses on Salesforce all here to do business with each other.And so we talk a lot about the economy right now, and it's complex, a bigger question then for people like me. But right now, people are doing business, you know, because despite all the complexity and the supply chain, foreign exchange, all the things that you talk about all the time on Yahoo Finance, digital is more relevant than it has ever been before. And Dreamforce is bigger than just Salesforce, right? All these people are connecting to find jobs to talk about digital transformation.And what I'm hearing is despite all the complexity of the economy, digital is the centerpiece of people's strategy. And what I'm really grateful for is this ecosystem is here to do business, to create jobs. And it's really rewarding. And honestly, it's been a long three years. I'm really grateful we're back.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Did you want to hit me with the GDP forecast? Oh, no. I just had to add to ask. I had to ask. But is it still, when you talk to customers, is it still a measured buying environment?BRET TAYLOR: Well, here's what I'll say, is I think CFOs have a lot of power right now. People are focused not just on top line growth like they were through the past few years, but also bottom line growth. When you think about digital technology, it's about both, right? It's about automation. And in fact, our big announcement here at Dreamforce from a technology standpoint was a product called Salesforce Genie, which is all about data, intelligence, automation, and real-time.And those are a lot of technology, whereas what it means if you're a technologist, it means I can build amazing new customer experiences. If you're a CFO, it means I can drive automation and cost savings and efficiency. And I think technology has a promise to do both. And that's what I think everyone is here to figure out, is, how can we drive results now in a time when time matters, value matters, automation matters? And that's what's so exciting. It's obviously a more measured environment, but I think technology is the solution.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you think this measured environment loosens up at all next year?BRET TAYLOR: We've talked a lot about this. And I'm not an economist. I actually just interviewed Larry Summers on stage here moments ago.BRIAN SOZZI: He was right on the Fed. He was right on the Federal Reserve [INAUDIBLE].BRET TAYLOR: He's been right about a lot of things. What we're trying to do is not try to predict the future of the economy. We're trying to help our customers navigate it. You know, so if you're a company and you're still navigating the complexities and the supply chain, if you're a multinational and you're trying to figure out what do we do with the strength of the dollar right now, where your Japan business is worth 1/3 less than it was a year ago, these are things that most managers haven't experienced in their careers.What we're trying to do is say, here's a platform. Here's a company that can focus on your success, on your innovation. Here's a company to help you develop trust with your customers. And we can help you be more resilient in the face of all this uncertainty.And I think that's why this sold out faster than any Dreamforce in our history. It's why 40,000 people are here, and millions of people are watching online because no matter how measured the environment is, people want to come together and find solutions. And I honestly feel a ton of optimism here at Dreamforce.BRIAN SOZZI: In your Keynote, it said something that was pretty interesting besides I was watching I think when bunny ears on the live stream was very fascinating.BRET TAYLOR: I'm never going to live down the bunny ear.BRIAN SOZZI: No, you're not. You're probably viral. You're around the world now. But you said you're seeing a better pace of organic innovation. What is driving that, in your view?BRET TAYLOR: Well, first, I just want to give a shout out to all the Salesforce engineering team if you're watching right now. I am so grateful for all their work through a pandemic, working from their homes. We've just invested a lot in what we call our core, our core CRM, sales, customer service, marketing, e-commerce, our core platform.And through all those foundational investments, in technologies like Hyperforce, which enables our customers to go with data residency in places like Europe, where compliance has become more complex for companies to navigate than ever before, and through those investments, we're really starting to see the returns in momentum. And I mentioned this in the keynote, but when Mark and Parker 20 years ago were at the first Dreamforce, probably not quite as big as this one--BRIAN SOZZI: I was still trying to get through my last year of college.BRET TAYLOR: Yeah, exactly. I think Parker had no gray hair at that point. There's 150 million PCs in the world. Fast forward today, there's 15 billion smartphones, more smartphones than people, 125 billion connected devices. And you need this pace of innovation for every one of our customers to keep pace with their customer expectations.And no matter what the roller coast of the economy that you can talk to Larry Summers about later, that secular trend of digital is moving faster than ever before. And we need to enable our customers to succeed in that environment, no matter how much they're focused on cost savings. And I'm really excited about the opportunity we have to do that.BRIAN SOZZI: Look, I know you're a busy guy, so I'll let you go. I'll end on this. One of the biggest questions we get on Salesforce at Yahoo Finance is, when are they buying another company? You bought Slack, MuleSoft, Tableau. But I think you've made some very key points on the last earnings call that you are focused on an operating margin of, what, 20.4%? You're not buying a company tomorrow, right? You seem very focused on driving better profits at this company.BRET TAYLOR: Well, first, let me just say, I'm so proud of the success of our acquisitions. You talked to Stewart Butterfield earlier this week, a remarkable entrepreneur. Our acquisitions have helped shaped who we are as a company today. So M&amp;A was a part of our past. M&amp;A will definitely be part of our future. But as you said, our focus right now is profitable growth.We know that as we scale, we got into $31 billion in revenue, 20.4% in operating margins. We want to expand our operating margins, expand our cash flow over time through discipline, and understand that there's leverage in our business. And I don't think the two are at odds with one another.But we're very committed to profitable growth. We're really committed to bottom line performance as well. I'm also really proud of how important acquisitions have been to our company. And we want to do so in a shareholder-friendly way and a disciplined way. But just look around you. We would not be here if not for MuleSoft, and Tableau, and Slack. And it's a part of our identity now.]"

On its investor day, RL brought forward the key aspects of its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate strategic growth plan and outlined its long-term financial targets for the next three years.Ralph Lauren has significantly transformed its business, backed by the “Next Great Chapter” plan, which was announced in June 2018. This is now followed by ""Next Great Chapter: Accelerate,"" focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth and value creation. Through the accelerated plan, the company is likely to continue building on its brand position; expand its distinctive, timeless products and experiences across multiple categories; and increase its presence in key cities across the globe.While RL reiterated its recently provided fiscal 2023 guidance, it outlined the financial growth targets for the next three years from a base of fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. For the next three years, the company anticipates a compound annual revenue growth rate of mid to high-single digits in constant currency. It expects the constant-currency operating margin to exceed the revenue guidance, expanding to at least 15% by the end of fiscal 2025. Growth is likely to be driven by modest gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, along with continued investments in the company’s long-term strategic priorities.Ralph Lauren expects the capital expenditure to be 4-5% of net revenues annually through fiscal 2025. The company remains committed to rewarding shareholders over the next three years by returning the excess free cash flow to them. It plans to return $2 billion to shareholders on a cumulative basis through fiscal 2025 in the forms of dividend payouts and share buybacks.Ralph Lauren hiked its quarterly dividend 9% to 75 cents per share at the beginning of fiscal 2023. This represents an annualized dividend of $3 per share. The company has $1.4 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.For fiscal 2023, RL anticipates year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth in the high-single digits on a 52-week comparable basis. This includes a 600-bps negative impact of unfavorable currency. On a 53-week comparable basis, the metric is likely to be hurt by an unfavorable currency of 100 bps.The operating margin is forecast to be 14-14.5% on a constant-currency basis. Notably, RL reported an operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week comparable basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis in the last year. The gross margin, on a 52-week comparable basis, is envisioned to expand 30-50 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR growth and positive product mix, which is expected to more than offset higher freight and product cost inflation. However, the unfavorable currency is likely to hurt the metric by 150 bps.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of 11% on a constant-currency basis. It anticipates an operating margin of 15.4-15.7% on a constant-currency basis, including the negative impacts of higher freight and marketing expenses. The gross margin is predicted to contract 40-80 bps year over year on a constant-currency basis due to rising freight and product costs, offsetting continued AUR growth.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s guidance for fiscal 2023 and the long term considers the possible impacts of the supply-chain conditions, inflationary pressures, foreign currency movement, the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 variants and other COVID-related disruptions.The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has gained 4.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.6%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Oxford Industries OXM, lululemon athletica inc.

The company said it became aware of the fire at around 01:30 a.m. on Sept. 20.Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Tesla generates most of its revenue from its electric car business, but Chief Executive Elon Musk has pledged to grow its solar energy and battery storage business to roughly the same size as its car business for the long-term.The company last year broke ground on its factory in Lathrop, California, to produce its large-scale, utility storage battery unit Megapack.PG&amp;E in April announced the commissioning of its 182.5-megawatt (MW) Tesla Megapack battery energy storage system (BESS) – known as the Elkhorn Battery – located at its Moss Landing electric substation in Monterey County.PG&amp;E said batteries are charged when energy demand is low or when solar production is high and then provide additional capacity by sending that reserved power to the grid as demand grows.It was not immediately known who is the battery cell supplier for Tesla's battery products.

Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, coastal areas topped August's list of least affordable rental markets, with rents accounting for the highest shares of household incomes in Miami (46.5%), Los Angeles (40.7%) and San Diego (37.1%).""Our analysis underscores the very real rental affordability challenges that many Americans face today. Rents are significantly higher than in previous years and are taking up a substantial portion of incomes, which are growing at a slower pace than inflation,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Still, there are some bright spots for renters as of late. Based on the general rule of thumb that you should keep housing costs to under 30% of your paycheck, renters were able to follow best practice in the majority of large metros in August. Plus, as rent growth continued to cool, national rents didn't hit a new record-high for the first time in nine months.1 If these trends and typical seasonal cooling persist, renters may be better able to keep housing costs to a relatively manageable portion of their budgets in the months ahead.""Hale added, the U.S. median rental price declined for the first time since November 2021 in August, to $1,771 from $1,781 in July.1 Additionally, rent growth continued moderating on a year-over-year basis, down to a single-digit increase (+9.8%) after 13 straight months at a double-digit pace. However, national rents remained more than 20% higher than in August 2020 overall (+22.8%) and across all unit sizes: Studios at a median $1,489 (+21.2%), one-beds at a median $1,653 (22.6%), and two-beds at a median $1,964 (+23.2%).Story continuesAugust 2022 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentChange over Aug. 2021Change over Aug. 2020Overall$1,7719.8 %22.8 %Studio$1,48911.8 %21.2 %1-bed$1,6539.3 %22.6 %2-bed$1,9649.1 %23.2 %Rental affordability worsens nationwide and especially in coastal metros Despite the cooldown in annual rent growth, August data indicates that rental affordability issues are rising.

Rental units include apartment communities as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). All units were studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units. National rents were calculated by averaging the medians of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history going back to March 2019.Rental affordability analysis: The affordable monthly rent is calculated by applying the 30% rule to the estimated 2022 monthly median household income nationwide ($6,716 across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average) and in each metro. The monthly median household income is derived from the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas. Due to the methodology changes noted below, Realtor.com has made historical revisions to its prior affordability analyses. For our most recently published affordability analysis on February 2022 data published in March 2022, the national rent-to-income share has been updated to 25.0%.Note on new methodology: With the release of its August 2022 Monthly Rental Report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting rental listing trends and metrics. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since September 2022 will not be directly comparable with previous releases, but future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.

Nevertheless, SAP’s performance is gaining from continued strength in its cloud business, especially the new Rise with SAP solution.Momentum in SAP’s Business Process Intelligence platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions along with healthy traction witnessed in SuccessFactors Employee Central, Ariba and Fieldglass, Qualtrics and other cloud-based offerings is noteworthy.

The initiative will result in producing low-cost, clean hydrogen by electrolysis while increasing value for the operators of zero-carbon nuclear plants.As the global demand for hydrogen is projected to increase manifold, there is a need to produce it in larger quantities from low and zero-carbon sources.Hence, this collaboration of Bloom Energy's solid oxide platform for converting water into hydrogen and Xcel Energy's nuclear energy infrastructure will provide the efficiency and reliability to accomplish the common goal of a cost-efficient, zero-carbon future through hydrogen generation.Insights of the CollaborationBloom Energy’s leading solid oxide platform for generating electricity and hydrogen is changing the future of energy production. Fortune 100 companies worldwide turn to BE as a trusted partner to deliver lower-carbon energy today and lead to a net-zero future.This latest collaboration will serve the purpose of producing zero-carbon hydrogen in a nuclear plant facility, thereby boosting the utility of nuclear power facilities.Bloom Energy anticipates that combining its solid oxide platform with XEL's Prairie Island nuclear facility will enable it to produce zero-carbon hydrogen more efficiently than low-temperature electrolysis alternatives. These include polymer electrolyte membranes or alkaline, which require nearly 40% more electricity to produce hydrogen. This will drag down the cost of hydrogen production.Bloom Energy plans to begin the construction of the electrolyzer in late 2023 and have it operational by early 2024.Peer MovesIn this context, a few companies from the Oil-Energy sector that are taking significant measures to promote hydrogen as a sustainable tool for meeting decarbonization challenges are as follows:In June 2022, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG laid out its vision for a clean energy transition by pursuing multiple technologies to help customers lower emissions. CEG received the U.S. Department of Energy’s permission to test the benefits of using nuclear energy to produce hydrogen at its Nine Mile Nuclear Station in Oswego, NY.The company is installing a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer that will separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water, resulting in carbon-free hydrogen.Constellation Energy Corporation’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is projected at 36%.In June 2022, TotalEnergies SE TTE entered into an agreement with Adani Enterprises Limited to acquire a 25% interest in Adani New Industries Limited. For the production and commercialization of green hydrogen in India, Adani New Industries Limited will be the exclusive platform of Adani Enterprises Limited and TotalEnergies.TotalEnergies’ long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 7.8%.Also, in June 2022, FuelCell Energy Inc.

142,fa512520-25c3-3c41-986e-3e9536a61e97,ADM,2022-09-22,Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) shareholders have earned a 33% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-nyse-adm-140548718.html,1663682748,STORY,['ADM'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) share price has soared 116% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Archer-Daniels-Midland achieved compound earnings per share growth of 40% per year. The average annual share price increase of 29% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Archer-Daniels-Midland, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 47% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 18% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Archer-Daniels-Midland   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.Of course Archer-Daniels-Midland may not be the best stock to buy.

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition. The role of software is constantly evolving. With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication software and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Synopsys SNPS, Cadence Design Systems CDNS and DecisionPoint Systems (DPSI).Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (mostly for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform among others. Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which are used by engineers, designers and researchers across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction; product design and manufacturing; and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry’s prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS open up significant opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also much shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Cloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure the cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents is driving demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps in delivering a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Mainstream adoption of Hybrid/Remote Work to Drive Demand: The continuation of work-from-home and the mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions, among others. However, global macroeconomic weakness along with geopolitical instability in Europe due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and lingering global supply chain troubles remain concerns. Increasing inflation could affect spending across small- and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #151, which places it in the bottom 40% of more than 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks have the potential to outperform the market. But before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Computer Software industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector but underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index in the past year.The industry has lost 25.6% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector’ decline of 13.6% and 31.4%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, a commonly-used multiple for valuing software companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 23.95X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.59X. It is also above the sector’s forward-12-month P/E of 19.89X.In the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 37.26X, as low as 22.61X and at the median of 27.80X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioForward 12-Month P/E Ratio3 Software Stocks to Snap Up Right NowCadence Design Systems: Based in San Jose, CA, Cadence offers products and tools that help customers design electronic products. The company’s performance is being driven by strength across all segments owing to healthy demand for the company’s diversified product portfolio. Frequent product launches and synergies from acquisitions are expected to help the company sustain top-line growth. Cadence recently acquired OpenEye Scientific Software which is expected to improve revenues by approximately $40 million in fiscal 2023 as well as expand the company’s market reach in pharmaceutical and biotechnology market.The company’s Palladium and Protium platform is gaining traction among clients in the hyperscale, AI/ML and server customers.Increasing investments in emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunities for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

The top-line performance is being driven by broad-based strength across several verticals amid global supply chain disruptions. Also, the company’s strong relationships with its OEMs and distribution partners are a tailwind.Synergies from recent acquisitions are likely to drive DecisionPoint’s performance.

(Nasdaq: SNPS), today published BSIMM13, the latest edition of the annual Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) report analyzing the software security practices across 130 organizations—including Adobe, PayPal and Lenovo—in their cumulative efforts to secure more than 145,000 applications built and maintained by nearly 410,000 developers.The findings highlight a significant increase in activities that indicate BSIMM member organizations are implementing a ""shift everywhere"" approach to perform automated and continuous security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and manage risk across their complete application portfolio.To learn more, download the BSIMM13 Trends &amp; Insights report.""The BSIMM13 findings suggest that with the attention placed on software supply chains, most enterprise organizations are taking a risk-based approach to application security. Such an approach recognizes that security isn't limited to the codebase; it includes the process of software development where security reviews and testing 'shift everywhere' to continuously improve security outcomes."" said Jason Schmitt, general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. ""The findings also demonstrate that BSIMM member organizations' software security initiatives are maturing, and they're now looking for ways to drive the scalability, efficiency and overall effectiveness of their programs.""Conducted by the Synopsys Software Integrity Group, BSIMM13 highlights evolving trends among member organizations' software security initiatives over the last 12 months, including:Managing Software Supply Chain Risk and the Rise of SBOMsLikely as a result of recent high-profile supply chain attacks, managing software supply chain risk—most commonly performed through identifying and securing open source software—appears to be a top priority for BSIMM member organizations. BSIMM13 reports a 51% increase in activities associated with controlling open source risk over the last 12 months, as well as a 30% increase in organizations building and maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to fully catalog the components within their deployed software.Integrating Security into Developer Toolchains As part of their efforts to ""shift everywhere"" BSIMM organizations made significant progress in integrating security options into CI/CD pipelines and developer toolchains over the last 12 months. BSIMM13 data notes a 48% growth in activities that enable organizations to include security tests in QA automation.Expanding Software Security Beyond Products and Applications BSIMM13 data also shows tremendous growth in activities that indicate security teams are working with operations to secure software that is not an application—such as automation created for CI/CD— as observations of activities for leveraging operational data for continuous improvement grew by 95% over the last 12 months.""Shift Everywhere"" with Automated and Continuous Testing BSIMM13 data reports that 82% of BSIMM member organizations now use automated code review tools—ranking among the top-10 most-observed activities in BSIMM13—which unlocks their ability to perform faster, incremental security tests and identify vulnerabilities as they are introduced throughout the SDLC.Story continuesEstablished in 2008, the BSIMM is a maturity model that observes and quantifies the activities performed by software security professionals to help members of the wider security community plan, execute and measure their organizations' initiatives. BSIMM data originates in interviews conducted with member organizations during a BSIMM assessment. Following the assessment, observation data is anonymized and added to the BSIMM data pool, where statistical analysis is performed to highlight trends around how BSIMM organizations are securing their software.In addition to publishing its annual report, BSIMM provides members with a private community to engage with peers, learn best practices and gain new insights through community discussions, blogs, e-learning courses, webinars and more exclusive content focused on securing software in today's dynamic business environment.""Having joined the BSIMM community in 2015, we have found significant value in leveraging the insights drawn from the annually refreshed observations to help us plan and measure our own security program, and also gain a sense of the practice areas that are most important to our customers,"" said Bill Jaeger, Executive Director of Lenovo's Infrastructure Solutions Group Product Security Office.

Verification and software teams can validate designs against real-world interfaces at the highest possible performance using the prototyping flow of the ZeBu EP1 system. The unified hardware also benefits from Synopsys' new faster compile technology to reduce turnaround time by up to 3x compared to the previous generation's compile technology.Synopsys protocol solutions for ZeBu EP1 offer a wide range of connectivity options to enable execution of complex software stacks and support many advanced interface protocols, such as PCI Express® (PCIe®) 5.0/6.0, USB 4, HBM3 and Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) through:At-speed connectivity with protocol interface cardsTransactors, including virtual testers for virtual interface connectivitySpeed adapters for in-circuit emulationSynopsys IP Prototyping Kits, for fast IP integration, software development and system validationIn combination with the Synopsys Virtualizer™ virtual prototyping tool, software developers have access to a fast hardware target for their software development and testing using unified hardware for hybrid emulation and prototyping.What Industry Leaders Are Saying""Compute is becoming increasingly complex and it is critical that we work together to ease some of the hardware and software challenges to clear a path for innovation,"" said Tran Nguyen, senior director of Design Services at Arm. ""As more Arm-based software-intensive applications are developed across mobile graphics, automotive, 5G and HPC, there is an increasing demand for emulation and prototyping capacity. Synopsys ZeBu EP1 system helps address the need for more verification cycles by providing a unified hardware with flexible capacity at the fastest performance.""""Synopsys continues to innovate its verification hardware family with the latest Synopsys ZeBu EP1 system, the first unified hardware to scale emulation and prototyping capacity,"" said Narendra Konda, vice president of Hardware Engineering at NVIDIA. ""As NVIDIA continues to increase the pace of innovation across compute-intensive domains like GPU, AI and ADAS, our long-standing collaboration with Synopsys enables us to meet verification and validation needs for chip designs today and well into the future.""About SynopsysSynopsys, Inc.

Over the years, HST has been disposing of its non-strategic assets that have maximized their value and utilizing the proceeds for acquiring or investing in premium properties in markets that are anticipated to recover faster, like leisure and drive-to destinations. Such efforts highlight the company’s prudent capital-management practices.Host Hotels has been broadening its acquisition focus to include urban markets beyond the top 25 to enhance its portfolio’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenues. These efforts bode well for its long-term growth.HST maintains a healthy balance sheet with no material debt maturities until January 2024. As of Jun 30, 2022, the company had $2.4 billion in total available liquidity. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. This financial flexibility will aid capital deployment for long-term growth opportunities and facilitate redevelopment activities.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for HST as it has moved marginally upward in the past week to $1.80.The stock has gained 13.7% in the quarter-to-date period against the industry’s fall of 1.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, with a cautious approach by many businesses and employees, the recovery of transient business and group travel is likely to be sluggish in the near term due to a delayed return to the office and limited face-to-face conferences.The spike in online short-term rentals has escalated the supply in the lodging industry, leading to increased competition in some markets.Interest rate hikes are likely to affect HST’s ability to purchase or develop real estate. Its dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Prologis PLD, Extra Space Storage EXR and Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts XHR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prologis’ 2022 FFO per share has moved marginally upward in the past two months to $5.17.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Extra Space Storage’s current-year FFO per share has moved 2.4% northward in the past two months to $8.46.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 3.2% over the past month to $1.59.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has amassed assets over $729.14 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.27%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.02%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Utilities sector--about 24% of the portfolio. Consumer Staples and Real Estate round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, At&amp;t Inc (T) accounts for about 2.88% of total assets, followed by Philip Morris Internation (PM) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 26.43% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskLVHD seeks to match the performance of the QS Low Volatility High Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The QS Low Volatility High Dividend Index provides stable income through investment in stocks of profitable U.S. companies with relatively high dividend yields, lower price and earnings volatility.The ETF has lost about -6.41% so far this year and it's up approximately 4.18% in the last one year (as of 09/22/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $35.76 and $41.12.The ETF has a beta of 0.74 and standard deviation of 22.20% for the trailing three-year period. With about 101 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFranklin U.S. Low Volatility High Dividend Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, LVHD is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $49.92 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $94.62 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It's this underlying stability combined with the dividend return that can provide a defensive cushion during periods of market turbulence – similar to today's environment.”Against this backdrop, the analysts at Morgan Stanley have picked out stocks that offer investors some of the most reliable dividends available. Using the TiipRanks platform, we’ve pulled up the details on three of those picks. Let’s dive in.Philip Morris International Inc. (PM)The first stock we’ll look at, Philip Morris, is well-known as one of the world’s largest tobacco companies, and the owner of venerable Marlboro brand cigarettes. While cigarettes and other smoking products make up the lion’s share of the firm’s sales, PM is strongly emphasizing its smokeless product lines. These include vapes, heated tobacco products, and oral nicotine pouches. The company boasts that its smokeless products, especially the heated tobacco lines, have helped over 13 million adult smokers worldwide quit smoking.The company’s dividend is worth a close look, as it offers investors a reliable payment with a long-term history of steady growth. PM first started paying out the dividend in 2008, when it went public; since then, the company has not missed a quarterly payment – and has raised the dividend every year, with a CAGR of 7.5%. The current quarterly dividend payment is $1.27 per share, up 2 cents from the previous quarter. The dividend annualizes to $5.08 per common share, and yields a strong 5.3%. The newly raised dividend is scheduled for payment on September 27.Story continuesThe dividend payment is supported, and fully covered, by PM’s regular quarter earnings, which in 2Q22 came in at $1.32 per diluted share. Philip Morris is targeting full-year diluted EPS in the range of $5.73 to $5.88, which is good news for dividend investors, as achieving that target will keep the dividend easily affordable for the company.Analyst Pamela Kaufman, covering this tobacconist for Morgan Stanley, takes notice of the company’s increasing sales in smokeless products, as well as its generally sound financial position, in recommending the stock.“Q2 results reflect many of the key tenets of our thesis, including attractive IQOS momentum with accelerating new IQOS user growth, solid combustibles fundamentals with positive international cigarette market share/volumes, and increased underlying guidance,” Kaufman opined.Looking forward, Kaufman rates PM an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a $112 price target for ~16% upside potential. (To watch Kaufman’s track record, click here)Overall, Philip Morris shares have a Moderate Buy from the Street consensus, based on 7 reviews that include 4 Buys and 3 Holds. (See PM stock forecast on TipRanks)Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG)Next up is Citizens Financial Group, a retail banking firm in the US markets. Citizens Financial is based in Rhode Island, and operates through 1,200 branches in 14 states, centered in New England but extending to the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. Retail and commercial customers can access a full range of services, including checking and deposit accounts, personal and small business loans, wealth management, even foreign exchange. For customers unable to reach a branch office, CFG offers mobile and online banking, and more than 3,300 ATM machines.Citizens Financial saw revenues exceed $2.1 billion in 2Q22, a year-over-year jump of 23.5%. Earnings came in below expectations; at $364 million, net income was down 43% y/y, and EPS, at 67 cents, was less than half of the $1.44 reported in the year-ago quarter.Despite the drop in earnings and share value, Citizens Financial felt confident enough to expand its capital return program. The Board authorized, in July, share repurchases up to $1 billion, and increase of $250 million from the previous authorization.At the same time, the company also announce an 8% increase in its quarterly common share dividend payment. The new payment, of 42 cents per share, went out in August; it annualizes to $1.68 and gives a yield of 4.5%. Citizens Financial has a history of both reliable dividend payments and regular increases going back to 2014; the dividend has been raised twice in the last three years.This stock has caught the eye of Morgan Stanley’s Betsy Graseck, who lays out an upbeat case for buying into CFG.""We are Overweight Citizens due to its above-peer earnings growth driven by multiple broad-based drivers, including its differentiated loan categories which drive better-than-peer loan growth, disciplined expense management, and EPS upside from bolt-on fee based acquisitions,"" Graseck wrote.Graseck's Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating comes with a $51 price target. Should her thesis play out, a twelve-month gain of ~37% could potentially be in the cards. (To watch Graseck’s track record, click here)Financially sound banking firms are sure to pick up Wall Street interest, and CFG shares have 13 recent analyst reviews on file, including 10 to Buy and 3 to Hold, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $46.85 implies ~28% one-year gain from the trading price of $36.76. (See CFG stock forecast on TipRanks)AvalonBay (AVB)The third Morgan Stanley pick we're looking at is AvalonBay, a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on apartment properties. REIT’s have a strong reputation for paying out solid dividends; they are required by tax codes to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders, and frequently use dividends to comply with the regulatory demands. AvalonBay owns, acquires, develops, and manages multi-family developments in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, in New England and the Mid-Atlantic regions, in the Pacific Northwest, and in California. The company targets properties in leading urban centers of its operating areas.Rising rents have been a large component of the general increase in the rate of inflation, and that has been reflected in AvalonBay’s top line. The company’s Q2 revenue, of $650 million, was the highest in the past two years. On earnings, a ‘noisier’ metric, AvalonBay reported $138.7 million in net income attributable to stockholders; diluted EPS came in at 99 cents per share, down from $3.21 in the year-ago quarter.While earnings per share were down, the company did report a year-over-year gain in a key metric, fund from operations (FFO) attributable to common stockholders. On a diluted basis, the FFO grew 22% y/y, from $1.97 to $2.41. This should be noted by dividend investors, as FFO is commonly used by REITs to cover the dividend.AvalonBay’s dividend was last paid out in July, at $1.59 per common share. The next payment, for October, has already been declared at the same rate. The $1.59 quarterly payment annualizes to $6.36 per common share, and gives a yield of 3.3%. AvalonBay has paid out a quarterly dividend in every quarter – without missing a beat – since it went public in 1994, and over the past 28 years has average a 5% annual increase in the payment.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Kramer sees a path forward for this company, and explains why investors should get in now: “We think AVB can trade at a premium to [peers] in our coverage given peer-leading SS-Revenue and strong FFO per share growth and a differentiated development program. We believe investors have a 'free option' on the development pipeline as the current stock price implies a ~19.7x multiple on our '23e FFO ex. external growth.”Kramer uses these comments to support his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, and his price target, set at $242, suggests that AVB has a 26% upside potential ahead of it. (To watch Kramer’s track record, click here)All in all, AVB shares have 8 Buys and 11 Holds, making the analyst consensus rating here a Moderate Buy. The stock is the most expensive on this list, at $190.87 per share, and the $226.17 average price target is indicative of ~18% upside potential for the coming months.

(NYSE:PM) (""Philip Morris"").As a long-term Swedish Match shareholder since 2003, Framtiden believes that the acquisition offer of SEK 106 per share deeply undervalues the Company.  Specifically, the offer:Does not adequately value Swedish Match's leading position in the rapidly growing non-tobacco nicotine pouch segment in the U.S. with their ZYN product, and the latent and massive market potential in both the U.S. and other countries;Underappreciates the uniqueness of a fast-growing established global consumer staples business;Forces the realization of capital gains that would otherwise be deferred for long-term investors who want to participate in the Company's continued growth; andIs significantly below Swedish Match's intrinsic value per share, which Framtiden estimates at close to SEK 200 per share.Accordingly, Framtiden informed the Board that it would not support the proposed transaction. The Framtiden Partnerships own over 14.5 million shares representing about 1% of outstanding shares.Dan Juran, Managing Member of The Framtiden Partnerships, said, ""My partner Chris Anderson and I believe that this deal does not make sense for long-term shareholders. I have closely followed Swedish Match's development for nearly two decades, built relationships with its managers, and currently serve as the Chairman of the Company's Nominating Committee. I was dismayed to see the Board recommend the sale of this Swedish jewel at a bargain price in the early stage of probably the greatest chapter in its long history.""Story continuesJuran continued, ""Investors may be tempted by the short-term premium, especially during a period of market declines, but I believe that Swedish Match in 2022 may be in the rarified air of Coca-Cola in the 1980's or Philip Morris itself in the 1950's. Those companies compounded earnings at a superior rate for many years, and shareholders who stuck with them were rewarded mightily. We believe sticking with Swedish Match is likely to prove far more remunerative to shareholders over time than cashing out.

(NYSE:PM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, sold US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$96.01. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Philip Morris International insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$246m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Philip Morris International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

158,750fbde2-086c-3c36-b764-ffc968d2b7c8,PM,2022-09-22,Philip Morris (PM) Benefits From Focus on RRPs & Pricing Power,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-pm-benefits-focus-155903137.html,1663689543,STORY,"['PM', 'IPAR']","[Philip Morris International Inc. PM has been benefiting from its focus on reduced-risk products (RRPs), given consumers’ increased inclination to this category. The company’s solid pricing efforts are working well. That said, escalated costs are putting pressure on its margin performance.Let’s delve deeper.Factors Favoring Philip MorrisSerious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk RRPs. The company is progressing with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating more than 30% of its net revenues in the second quarter of 2022. Smoke-free net revenues formed nearly 30% of pro forma total while exceeding 30% of total PMI during the first half of 2022. IQOS,a heat-not-burn device, reflected almost 5% of the pro forma first-half RRP net revenues.In second-quarter 2022, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance with solid pro forma user growth of over 1.1 million, reflecting a sequential acceleration from the first quarter as device limitation and COVID restrictions are easing. IQOS ILUMA generated solid results across the first three markets: Japan, Switzerland and Spain. Management expects solid IQOS growth in the third quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company is well placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Philip Morris recently proposed a combination with Swedish Match to its smoke-free portfolio is a major step in the transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The transaction will likely conclude in the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory and other approvals.In February 2021, the company revealed plans to generate at least $1 billion in annual net revenues from ‘Beyond Nicotine’ products by 2025. The initiative leverages its expertise in life sciences, inhalation technology and natural ingredients, among others. As part of the strategy, the company made three meaningful buyouts in the third quarter of 2021, including Vectura Group plc, Fertin Pharma A/S and OtiTopic.Philip Morris has long been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance across most regions during the second quarter of 2022. Proforma pricing for combustible products rose 3.5% and nearly 5%, excluding Indonesia.Story continuesHurdles on WayIn second-quarter 2022, Philip Morris’ proforma adjusted operating income margin fell 1.9 points on an organic basis. The decline can be attributed to tough comparisons with the last year’s productivity savings, the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA devices and heated tobacco units, investments to expand the smoke-free portfolio, supply-chain hurdles (especially due to the Ukraine war) and overall cost hikes for certain direct materials, energy, wage and transportation induced by the pandemic recovery and worsened by the Ukraine war.For 2022, the gross margin is expected to be lower due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes (with supply restrictions easing), the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs.

Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discussion of our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. We have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. We acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. Our capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had another good quarter considering the market environment. We remain encouraged by the positive trends in air traffic and the recovery we continue to see in the commercial aerospace market. Our Q3 results show positive growth in comparison to the same period in 2021 as we are lapping the third fiscal quarter of '21, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic. Although our results have improved over the prior year quarter, they continue to be unfavorably affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed. However, we are happy to see the continued steady improvement in global air traffic. Domestic air traffic remains the leader in the air traffic recovery, and international air traffic improved these past few months as more passengers return to long-haul travel. With softened or fully lifted travel restrictions in majority of countries and the summer travel season upon us, passenger travel demand has been strong. China domestic air traffic remains low but is making progress from its most recent sharp drop-off due to strict zero-COVID policies limiting travel. International traffic in China is finally starting to improve off of COVID lows. In our business, we saw another quarter of robust growth in our commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings. I am very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment, our EBITDA as defined margin was 49.8% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues as well as the careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had good operating cash flow generation in Q3 of over $300 million and closed the quarter with a little over $3.8 billion of cash. We expect to continue generating additional cash in our final quarter of fiscal 2022. Next, an update on our busy quarter for capital allocation activities. I am happy to report that during Q3, we opportunistically deployed $245 million of capital via open-market repurchases of our common stock. This equates to approximately 444,000 of our shares at an average price of $554 per share. Although the price remained attractive, we were limited this quarter on the quantum we could purchase after the completion of the DART acquisition. These repurchases are in addition to the approximately 1 million shares we repurchased in our Q2 for a total of over $900 million deployed this year on share repurchases. We view these repurchases like any other capital investment and expect this will meet or exceed our long-term objectives. Also with respect to capital allocation and as we mentioned in our press release, we've decided to pay a special dividend of $18.50 per share. The dividend will be paid on August 26. Mike will address this and our buybacks more later. As for acquisitions during the quarter, we completed the DART Aerospace acquisition for approximately $360 million in cash. DART is a leading provider of highly engineered unique helicopter solutions that mainly service civilian aircraft and fits well with our proprietary and aftermarket-focused value-generation strategy. Although we are not providing formal revenue guidance, we expect the DART acquisition to contribute approximately $30 million to our FY '22 revenue. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model. Acquisition opportunities continue, and we have a decent pipeline of possibilities, as usual, mostly in the small and midsize range. Although I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. In aggregate, we have allocated about $2.4 billion of capital this year for value-generating activities. Pro forma for the special dividend payout in late August, we still expect to have a sizable cash balance of close to $3 billion. These capital allocation actions will still leave us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Now moving to our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Consistent with our commentary on the last earnings call, at this time, we expect to reinitiate guidance on the November 2022 earnings call for our new fiscal year, assuming prevailing conditions continue to evolve. We remain encouraged by the recovery we have seen in our commercial OEM and aftermarket revenues and the strong bookings received for both thus far in fiscal 2022. We continue to expect COVID-19 to have an adverse impact on our financial results compared to pre-pandemic levels in our final quarter of fiscal 2022 under the assumption that both our commercial OEM and aftermarket customer demand will remain depressed due to lower worldwide air travel, although recent positive trends in commercial air traffic could impact us favorably. As for the defense market, we're revising our defense revenue growth to flat for fiscal 2022 versus prior year. We have lowered our defense revenue expectations for fiscal 2022 primarily due to shipment delays as a result of limited supply chain shortages and delays in U.S. government defense spending outlays. As you know, bookings and shipments in this end market can often be quite lumpy. Jorge will provide more color on this topic in his section. We expect full year fiscal 2022 EBITDA margin to now surpass 48% due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery. As a final note, this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our Cobham acquisition and DART acquisition of about 0.5% this year. We believe we are well positioned for the last quarter of our fiscal 2022. As usual, we'll closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets develop, and we'll react accordingly. Mike will provide details on other fiscal 2022 financial assumptions and updates. Let me conclude by stating that I'm pleased with the company's performance in this period of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on executing our operating strategy and managing our cost structure. Now let me hand it over to Jorge to review our recent performance and a few other items. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion now includes the recent acquisition of DART Aerospace in both periods and the impact of any divestitures completed in fiscal 2021 are removed in both periods. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we'll split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 23% in Q3 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were up significantly compared to the same prior year period and again strongly outpaced sales. Sequentially, total commercial OEM sales improved almost 5% compared to Q2. We're encouraged by build rates steadily progressing at the commercial OEMs. However, there have been overall downward revisions in expected future production rates by the commercial OEMs primarily due to labor shortages and supply chain issues. Our expectation remains that in the short term, the demand for our commercial OEM products will continue to be reduced. Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 44% in Q3 when compared with prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by robust demand in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q3. Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 7%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q3 bookings strongly outpaced sales. To touch on a few key points of consideration, global revenue passenger miles are still depressed compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, revenue passenger miles have continued to trend upwards over the past months after the slight pullback in January that was primarily due to the Omicron variant. The continued recovery in air travel, especially the progress we have recently seen in international travel, confirms the pent-up demand to travel. Commentary from airlines in recent months has also been positive regarding robust passenger demand. Even with airline ticket prices higher than historical levels, passenger demand has remained strong in the summer season. The recovery in domestic travel continues to be stronger than international travel. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for June, domestic air traffic was only down 19% compared to pre-pandemic. The U.S. and Europe continue to lead, showing strong demand for domestic travel. U.S. domestic travel is only off about 8% from pre-pandemic levels. China domestic travel is still down about 50% but is beginning to show signs of recovery from its most recent steep drop-off in air travel due to its zero-COVID policies. The international air traffic recovery has made strides over these past few months. With many of the government-imposed travel restrictions lifted, passengers have been returning to long-haul travel. In March, international travel was still down about 50%. But in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for June, international travel was only down about 35% compared to pre-pandemic levels. For both the U.S. and Europe, international traffic is within 20% or better of pre-pandemic levels. Asia Pacific international travel is improving but continues to unfavorably impact the overall international air traffic recovery with RPKs still down about 70%. Global air cargo demand has tempered over the past few months. As of IATA's most recent data, June was another month of year-over-year decline in air cargo volumes, though they remain above pre-pandemic levels. There's optimism for improvement in air cargo as COVID lockdown measures eased in Asia, particularly in China. Business jet utilization still remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Commentary from business jet OEMs and operators reflects confidence in the demand outlook. It's possible that the pandemic brought a positive structural change to biz jet demand, but that will take some time to prove out. Now let me speak about our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, was about flat in Q3 when compared with the prior year period. As we've said many times, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. Similar to the first half of 2022, our teams continue to experience delays in fulfilling orders due to supply chain shortages. The supply chain issues mainly surround the lack of availability of electronic components. Our operating units continue to implement mitigating actions to overcome these challenging issues. Also impacting our defense market revenue are the delays in the U.S. government defense spend outlays. There's often a lag between U.S. government defense spend authorizations and outlays and the lag is hard to predict, but these delays are longer than typical. As Kevin mentioned earlier and for the reasons I just discussed, we're revising down the expectation for our defense market revenue growth to about flat for fiscal 2022. We were previously expecting low single-digit percent range growth. I'd like to wrap up by expressing how extremely pleased I am with our strong operational performance this quarter. Our teams have continued to put forth significant efforts in overcoming the negative impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. We remain focused on our value drivers and executing with operational excellence. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on some additional financial matters for the quarter and also our expectations for the full fiscal year. First, in regard to profitability for our third quarter. EBITDA as defined of about $696 million for Q3 was up 25% versus prior year Q3. EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was 49.8%. This represents year-over-year improvement of about 390 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA as defined margin increased by 210 basis points. Next, a few quick comments on select financial metrics for the quarter and also year. Organic growth was 17% for the quarter, driven by the growth in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On taxes, we still expect our GAAP and cash rates to be in the 21% to 23% range and our adjusted tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range for the year. Moving to cash and liquidity. We had another quarter of positive free cash flow. Free cash flow, which we traditionally define at TransDigm as EBITDA as defined less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, was roughly $400 million. For the full fiscal year, we now expect to generate free cash flow in excess of the $1 billion target previously provided. During the quarter, we used $245 million of cash to repurchase shares at a weighted average purchase price of about $554 per share and ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash on hand. We view these share repurchases just like any other capital investment, such as the acquisition of a new business, and expect a similar rate of return. With regard to the dividend, the $18.15 (sic) [$18.50] per share payment announced this morning represents a gross payout amount of about $1.070 billion. The record date for the dividend is August 19, and the payout date is expected to be August 26. Additionally, in the 10-Q that is filed later today, you'll see that our strong sales growth resulted in net working capital being a $119 million use of cash this quarter. As mentioned previously, we have the cash to fund this investment and are glad to see our primary commercial end markets rebounding and therefore, driving this need. As we continue to recover from COVID's impact on air travel and rebound to 2019 global activity levels, we'd expect an additional $100 million to $175 million of cash to go back into net working capital. The time line over which this will happen remains uncertain but should generally track the recovery. Moving on to leverage levels. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is currently at 6.3x. Pro forma for the dividend, our leverage level will be just over 6.7x net debt-to-EBITDA. We expect to continue running free cash flow-positive during our fourth quarter, and this ratio will, therefore, come down from the 6.7x level by the end of the fiscal year, barring any additional capital market transactions or shareholder distributions. We are watching the rising interest rate environment closely, and we remain 85% hedged on our total $20 billion gross debt balance through a combination of interest rate caps and swaps through calendar year 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates for the time being. Finally, as Kevin mentioned, we are pleased to have allocated $2.4 billion of capital thus far this year across the range of options available to us: acquisitions, buybacks and dividends. Consistent with our past practices, we'll continue to evaluate this full range of options with regard to all of our future capital deployment actions. The priorities are unchanged: first, reinvesting in our own businesses; second, acquisitions; third, returning capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchases; and finally, paying down debt, which seems unlikely at this time but remains an option. From an overall cash, liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we believe we remain in a strong and good position going forward. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&amp;A. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Egon Strauss, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin, it looks like the air transport aftermarket is now back to around 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Is that about right? And when do you -- when would you expect us to -- your business to get back to pre-pandemic levels at this point? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think you're -- that's directionally accurate. I don't really have a prediction. It depends on flight activity. We continue to follow that closely and think that takeoffs and landings are the best indicator for aftermarket activity. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Egon Strauss, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And from a head count perspective, can you maybe baseline us where you are to, I guess, adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures. What your head count looks like today relative to pre-pandemic levels as much as you can on an apples-to-apples basis? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I'll take that one. I don't have the exact numbers to pre-pandemic levels accounting for the acquisitions. I'd say we've held on to the bulk of the restructuring that we did as a result of the COVID crisis, and the teams have done a nice job managing the resources. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth George Herbert, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin, maybe on the commercial transport aftermarket up over -- were up 56% in the quarter. Can you provide any detail or any further segmentation on that by sort of what you're seeing in the market? And was there any maybe onetime items in terms of shipments to distributors or inventory corrections or anything else in the quarter? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll let Jorge handle that. I don't think there were any onetime items though. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Working backwards, I concur with Kevin. There were no unique onetime items this last quarter that drove any of the performance. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong performance in our passenger submarket, but I would say all of our aftermarket submarkets are seeing pretty good strength. So we're seeing continued recovery. It's, as I mentioned, the domestic markets in the U.S. and Europe. And then the international has been a little bit slower, but we are seeing some recoveries there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth George Herbert, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Helpful. And if I could on that, I know, obviously, pricing has been a tailwind. With some of the commentary from airlines about maybe some slower capacity growth into next year just on sort of broader concerns, are you seeing any of that slowdown to any incremental pressure on pricing or your ability to get price in the aftermarket? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think our pricing philosophy remains unchanged. We look to get some level of real price increase above inflation. And the teams are doing a good job trying to pass on some of the inflationary costs that we're seeing. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wondered if you could spend a little more time just diving into the margin performance in the quarter. It stands out -- is there anything unusual in there? Can we use that as a starting point sequentially going forward? Or is that aggressive? I know you've mixed up, but I don't know if that changes soon. And then obviously, the price/cost dynamic has been favorable but also probably doesn't change. So any thoughts on how you progress moving forward from here? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we're going to -- we're benefiting tremendously from the mix right now. We have an aftermarket that is expanding. And right now, OEM is well behind where we would expect it to be or where it was. So there's going to be a mix blend that has to come back. So we'll have to see how the OEMs come up the curve in terms of their build rates. Right now, as Jorge alluded to, we're still seeing limitations in OEM build rate request for product, even though the order book is building. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Do you have margin seasonality through the year organically if we strip out acquisitions? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm not sure exactly what you mean by margin seasonality, Noah, but I think you know from the past, there's a quarterly step-up as you go from Q1 through Q4. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1 as always... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You'll continue seeing that going forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Q1 is always a poor quarter, generally speaking, for us. End of year, OEMs focused on inventory and the like. It's always one of our weakest quarters is Q1. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But there were no -- to go back to one of your original questions, Noah, there were no unusual accounting items or anything else during the quarter. And with regard to where we go from here, I think we'll give the FY '23 guidance on the November call. And -- but at this point, we don't want to comment on where we could go from here from a margin standpoint until we do that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And Kevin, could you just spend another minute on the acquisition pipeline and what's maybe holding things back from closing right now? What's unusual? When can it change? Just any other color you could give there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I suspect this is the biggest question. As we pay a dividend, sometimes people will then reflect that the pipeline may not be full. We believe we have enough cash and access to cash as we look forward that we can handle the acquisition pipeline that we see coming at us. I always comment on this that it's difficult to predict when things will close. I know the team is very busy. We're looking at a lot of businesses. The unfortunate piece is sometimes in our very disciplined acquisition approach, things fall out. And we're not interested in taking flyers on not great companies. So we take our time. We're very disciplined and structured in our approach. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Michael Spingarn, Melius Research LLC - MD [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin, in the past, you've talked about commercial OE being a bit more labor-intensive than the aftermarket. And I believe you've been investing in automation. With that activity, if OE build rates get back to pre-COVID levels, could you accommodate that with less labor than you needed pre-COVID? And would OE margins be higher as a result? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we always focus on productivity in this business. We have historically focused on it. It's reasonable to expect that with years of productivity under our belt since the OEMs were shipping at high volume that we'd be able to do some things better than we could before. But this is always part of our ongoing productivity ramp as we try to overcome the, as you realize, dramatic inflationary pressures that we're seeing really across the board. Whether it's labor or materials, there's a lot of inflation pressure on the business. We have a model that allows us and helps us pass along those inflationary pressures, but productivity is something that we're always laser-focused on. And I believe we will be in a slightly better position, but it is hard to quantify that, and you have to offset that against the inflationary pressures that we're seeing. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Michael Spingarn, Melius Research LLC - MD [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And just on that, while you're clearly pricing above inflation, what are you seeing in terms of wage inflation? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, it's different by region. You can't really pick on any. I think, Jorge, what are you seeing in California and some of the regions for direct labor? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I mean we've seen it more towards the entry-level labor pool, where we've seen regional increases. So we've seen anywhere probably between 5% and 7%. But that might be a little bit of a lagging indicator, right? The inflationary pressures continue in the current job market, a little bit on the technical side as well, probably higher than the entry-level labor side. But again, the teams -- as Kevin mentioned, productivity is near and dear to our hearts. So they continue to find opportunities to do their best to offset those increases. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Michael Spingarn, Melius Research LLC - MD [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Jorge, are you getting the people you need or are you behind? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No. So far, the teams have been able to support the resource needs. There's some timing. Hiring takes a little bit longer. But we're not seeing any significant or material impacts due to labor issues. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Alan Stallard, Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin, on the M&amp;A topic again, what's your latest sort of feeling on what the prices are out there? Because we've clearly seen some pretty high multiples being paid, particularly on the aerospace side recently. I was wondering if you can still make things work under your calculations? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We can still make things work. I think some of the prices have come under pressure recently as there's been some corrections. But I think we can still make it work our LBO model that we run through. Our goal is -- we're not focused on certain products. As long as it sits in the aerospace world, is proprietary and has aftermarket, we will find a way to drive the returns we look for, and those are the types of businesses we continue to stay very disciplined in our approach to find. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Alan Stallard, Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Right. And then on the supply chain issue, particularly in defense, are you seeing any sign of this getting any better? Or in the sort of medium term, should we expect the same -- remain pretty much the same? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think the -- I'll take that one. I think the situation is somewhat stable, but still challenged. So that's probably going to continue for the foreseeable future, primarily on those electronic components, the issues with semiconductors, et cetera. But the teams are doing good jobs trying to mitigate those issues. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gautam J. Khanna, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just wanted to ask on -- just following up on Rob's question. Is this a -- the guidance reduction there, was that -- is that a function of bookings or is it supply chain? Or is it both? And if so, could you parse out how much it was to each? And then just... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There's a little bit of impact. Let me -- before you move on, there's a little bit of impact to both. In our minds, the -- we're not a bellwether of the defense industry. We follow what everyone else sees. And we're seeing a larger slowdown in defense outlays and a slowdown in the defense industry. That's -- we just react to what we see. It's not necessarily a bookings problem. It's when are things due and when do they want product. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gautam J. Khanna, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And is there any chance you can quantify how much the supply chain has dragged your ability to deliver and if there's any line of sight to improvement there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I don't think it's a major driver because we find ways to work around it. But -- so I'm not necessarily seeing it as a drag on our business. I see it as a drag on the defense industry as a whole, and that's slowing down. So it's hard for me to put a quantum on that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gautam J. Khanna, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fair enough. And last question, just by region in the aftermarket, any discernible differences from where you sit? I don't know, China is getting better. Was it particularly soft in the quarter? Anything you could speak regionally on aftermarket? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think as you know, we don't track the aftermarket specific by region. I think, generally, we're seeing what some of the larger macro-level trends with the U.S. and Europe, domestic travel being stronger and international travel showing a little bit of recovery. Obviously, Asia seems to be the laggard right now in terms of international travel. But we don't track specific regional activity. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Peter J. Arment, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin, you -- there was some commentary around biz jets being back to kind of their post -- well above pre-pandemic levels and the structural shift. Maybe you could just talk about, are you -- what are you seeing there in the ability to take rates up even further on biz jet side? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think there's room for them to take rates up as their order book seems to support it. This is a special time for the business jet world market. It is very busy. So we're seeing it both on OEM and aftermarket that this is a much busier time for business jet market. Jorge, anything else to add on that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think -- and the only thing I'd add is we're seeing some good performance on the larger cabins. There's, obviously, increased demand for the larger cabin aircraft. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Peter J. Arment, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just related to aftermarket. I know you don't break it out versus -- narrow-body versus wide-body. But as wide-body starts to reengage, is it still, still a smaller portion just compared to how levered you are in narrow-body? How should we think about the wide-body recovery there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think, generally, we're market-weighted based on the fleet between narrow-body and wide-body. You might have some noise on any particular operating unit. But generally, we seem to be market-weighted between the 2. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And we -- yes, we don't care if it's narrow-body or wide-body. We are profitable with both segments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Seth Michael Seifman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think I asked you this probably about a year ago or so. But I was wondering how you're thinking about M&amp;A in the current antitrust landscape. And now we see reports that the FTC is poking around the deal that Northrop closed 4 years ago. The Department of Justice is trying to prevent Booz Allen from doing a relatively small $400 million deal. So as a company that's kind of traditionally been focused on M&amp;A, how do you think about what may be changing in the landscape? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [52] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, we're still active in M&amp;A. It's certainly something that we're cognizant of. And I tend not to speculate on things that haven't impacted us or provide that kind of color. It is something that we're cognizant of. We're watching it closely. And that's probably all I can say on it. It hasn't derailed our activity. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Seth Michael Seifman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst [53] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up also on capital deployment. I think you mentioned that the DART deal limited the potential for share repurchases this quarter. I guess, can you give us an update with this dividend? First of all, were you limited on the size of the dividend that you could pay out? And second of all, with this move to 6.7 pro forma, probably something more like 6.3 by the end of the fiscal year, what are the options for capital deployment? Is it pretty much M&amp;A at this point? Or in the first half of '23, if you wanted to buy stock or pay another dividend, is that an option? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [54] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, the priorities are unchanged, as we mentioned in the comments, just in terms of what we'd like to spend our capital on with acquisitions coming ahead of dividends and share repurchases. So that's the same as it has always been. On the dividend, we do have a restricted payments basket cap in our credit agreement that I think you guys are familiar with. So that did play into our thinking on the size there. But we should nicely continue to tick down here over the course of the fourth quarter, and we'll end the year down closer to where we ended this quarter. So we'll have more than enough buyer power to go do M&amp;A deals, and if things don't materialize there, pay dividends or repurchase shares, we continuously evaluate all those options every month, every quarter just to decide what the best use of capital is for us. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [55] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kristine Tan Liwag, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst [56] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin, Jorge, with the tightness in the supply chain, breadth of the TransDigm portfolio, are there opportunities for you to step in some struggling suppliers and gain additional market share? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [57] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I mean, I think our teams are always looking for good new business opportunities and opportunities to improve their portfolio and products. I think the teams are very engaged with our airline customers as well as the OEs. They've done a nice job navigating the current supply chain issues. And hopefully, we'll get some opportunities. But I think that's part of our standard focus on new business and profitable new business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kristine Tan Liwag, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst [58] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I see. And maybe following up on Noah's question earlier on margins. I mean margins continue to trend up, and you're pretty much just shy (inaudible) in the quarter. With mix getting better or as OEM volumes shift to the right and aftermarket still got a ways to go to get to pre-COVID levels, I mean, do you need to see margin step up and stay at 50% and above sustainably? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [59] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I think... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [60] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Go ahead, Mike. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Lisman, TransDigm Group Incorporated - CFO [61] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think it's hard to say where margins go from here just given the uncertainty in the market and the way the mix plays out going forward on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So we're hesitant to give any guidance on where we go going forward in this environment. And I think we'll give just some more in terms of expectations there for our next fiscal year on the November call when we give the formal guidance. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [62] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Guidance comes on when we review next call, as Mike said. But let's keep in mind that there is a favorable mix environment that we're experiencing right now. And until OEM shipments come back, you'll see some balancing higher margins that will come back the other way when OEMs ship more. We just have to know that that's going to happen. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [63] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski with Alembic Global. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Peter John Skibitski, Alembic Global Advisors - Research Analyst [64] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just one left for me on the defense side. Kevin, I'm wondering if all of this surge in European defense spending does come to pass, maybe in the next couple of years. Is that something you guys expect to kind of directly benefit from? Or on the defense side, are you a bit more -- or generally speaking, are you much more domestically exposed versus internationally? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [65] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We're nicely exposed to international defense as well. I think, yes, some of this business you might expect would come our way at some point, but it's difficult to predict or understand. I think we all have to recognize that some of this production will happen locally in -- or within the European Union possibly. We do have production there, so we will be part of it. But we should all keep that in mind that some of this may be domestic consumption as well as international orders. But we would expect that this is a favorable environment for TransDigm as we look forward. The degree of favorability, well, we'll have to see. I think there's also concern whether some of this additional spending maybe loses steam if social issues overcome the military desires right now. Again, we'll have to see how this all unpacks in the future. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [66] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Frank Ciarmoli, Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [67] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just to stay on defense, are you guys seeing any noticeable difference between aftermarket or OEM? And then I'm assuming you're probably -- it's probably your Data Device Corp. that's probably seeing the outsized impact of kind of the semiconductor shortages. But any color there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [68] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think the defense aftermarket is hanging in there a little bit better than the defense OEMs. And some of that could just be timing of the outlays, as we noted. In terms of the electronic components, I think it's fair to look across the portfolio and those businesses that are more electronics-based naturally are seeing more of that impact. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Frank Ciarmoli, Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [69] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. I know you're not going to talk to '23 yet, but assuming we get some level of supply chain improvement, I mean you're going to start the year with some pretty easy defense comps. Do you think supply chain kind of is a headwind in first half of '23? Or do you think we can get some nice growth there just based off the comps and maybe some alleviation of the tightness we're seeing? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [70] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I don't think we're in a position to comment on the FY '23 guidance or any specific comparisons, as Mike and Kevin have mentioned. I think the supply chain continues to be strained. We don't see this going away anytime soon or overnight. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [71] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from [Nicholas Zhang] with Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [72] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can you hear me all right? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [73] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [74] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [75] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So you're seeing strong recovery in commercial aftermarket, you're seeing some supply chain issues in defense, and you're also seeing like order book build up. So what does expansion of existing operations look like? And will there be more CapEx going forward? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [76] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll comment on CapEx. I think there's always opportunity for internal investment in our businesses, and we're constantly looking for those. We are looking at some select -- additional investment in some of our businesses. But again, these things all pay back. We have the same payback standards as before. So maybe there'll be some selectively, but I don't see any major trend of additional spending. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jorge L. Valladares, TransDigm Group Incorporated - COO [77] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think, in general, the operating units come to us with different ideas, and they've been very focused in automation over the last 2 to 3 years. But we don't expect any significant shift in the overall CapEx that we've traditionally run at. In terms of capacity, we're looking to leverage some of the restructuring activities that we did over the past couple of years and the process improvements to support additional demand. But that's something that each team looks at individually and something that we're constantly talking about in this environment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin M. Stein, TransDigm Group Incorporated - President, CEO &amp; Director [78] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think one area that we are doing some selective investment is solar at some of our facilities help with our greenhouse gas footprint. So we are looking for investments of that nature as well. And that's something that we are spending a little more money on as those opportunities now have a reasonable payback across our businesses. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [79] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I would now like to turn the conference back to Jaimie Stemen for closing remarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jaimie Stemen, TransDigm Group Incorporated - Manager of Financial Reporting [80] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes today's call. We appreciate your time, and have a good rest of your day. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [81] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

This deal is made possible by a long-term agreement between Constellation and the project developer and long-term owner, Swift Current Energy, under which Constellation will purchase a portion of the energy and RECs generated by Double Black Diamond. Construction of the solar project is expected to start by the end of 2022.PPG’s Adrian facility manufactures adhesives and sealants for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and has more than 65 employees. The facility will procure approximately 3,500 megawatt hours of energy per year from the Double Black Diamond solar project, which is expected to help PPG reduce its carbon footprint by more than 2,400 metric tons annually. This is the equivalent emissions of more than 530 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year, according to EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies.""We recognize the pivotal moment we are facing for climate change and how much work there is to be done to reduce our collective carbon impact,"" said Diane Kappas, PPG vice president, Global Sustainability. ""Our collaboration with Constellation and Swift Current Energy will allow us to continue making progress against our near-term decarbonization goals and enable us to operate our Adrian facility in a more energy efficient manner. We look forward to identifying additional renewable energy opportunities globally to meet our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.""Story continues""Constellation is proud to complete its second offsite renewable agreement with PPG in as many years, and we commend PPG on taking proactive steps to reduce its carbon footprint,"" said Jim McHugh, chief commercial officer, Constellation.

The footprint expansion will strengthen Goldman’s relationships with existing clients in the EU and aid the wall street biggie in serving new clients across the region.GS has offered capital markets, financing, trading and transaction advisory services in Europe. Hence, the expansion increases the breadth of the firm’s offering.The transaction banking platform, known as TxB, was launched in the United States in 2020 and was extended in the U.K. last year. To date, the platform has done business with more than 400 clients, processed trillions of dollars through its systems and accepted more than $65 billion in deposits.The company has further expanded in new markets and will start from a new location in Frankfurt. It also plans to expand to Amsterdam. This will enable GS to serve clients’ treasury needs like deposits and payments in more than 160 countries and 120 currencies.TxB’s digital-first and cloud-based global platform offers clients visibility into their accounts, payments and liquidity positions across currencies and countries.Per management, “We are excited to bring the Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking experience to clients with treasury needs in the European Union. We understand the challenges of running a complex global treasury operation, and built our platform to be nimble, secure and easy-to-use to support clients as they run and grow their businesses.”The expansion will further diversify the company’s business and revenues. It is in line with Goldman’s efforts to diversify the business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings. GS has been undertaking initiatives to boost asset management and wealth management business, while expanding its digital consumer banking platform.The GreenSky acquisition will facilitate the expansion of its point-of-sale capability. In February 2021, the company launched an automated wealth-management platform called Marcus Invest to expand the suite of consumer financial offerings within its digital consumer lending unit.Story continuesGoldman expanded GS Bank’s business by acquiring an online deposit platform from GE Capital Bank in April 2016.

Deliberations are ongoing and details of Rakuten Bank Ltd.’s offering, including bank manager lineup and size, could still change, they said.A spokesperson for Rakuten declined to comment, as did representatives at Goldman and Daiwa.The bank’s planned listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is part of a push by Rakuten to expand in financial services. Stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc. is capping the Japanese company’s core e-commerce revenues, while aggressive promotions for its mobile unit are saddling the company with losses.Rakuten’s fintech segment is increasingly driving growth at a company that remains largely moored in Japan, despite its ambitions to expand overseas. The company’s credit card, bank, securities and insurance businesses together constituted its biggest earner of operating income in the April-June quarter. Rakuten is separately preparing to list its securities unit.“It makes sense for Rakuten to raise money to help the banking unit grow further - the combination of its e-commerce operations and fintech makes the company a strong, attractive player in Japan,” said Morningstar analyst Kazunori Ito.Story continuesHiroshi Mikitani, the company’s chief executive officer and founder, had bet big on wireless services by building a fourth mobile network in a saturated market controlled by NTT Docomo Inc., KDDI Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp.’s wireless unit SoftBank Corp. That costly wager has resulted in continued losses at a company that had for years held its own against Amazon.Rakuten’s quarterly operating loss widened from a year ago, prompting S&amp;P Global Ratings to slap the company with a negative credit outlook. The Japanese company’s nonfinancial unit is expected to be “deeply negative” of free operating cash flow in the coming 12 to 18 months, as improvement in its mobile business is further delayed, S&amp;P said.The mobile unit’s losses are a result of “miscalculations that cannot be reversed, and more cash will be needed over the long term,” Ito said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMental Health Crisis Leads Hospitals to Create a New Type of ERThe Supreme Court Is About to Display Its Power Imbalance AgainThe Sneaky Genius of Apple’s AirPods EmpireUS Is Inflating Its Debt Away After Unprecedented Spending BingeTo Find Success at Work, Match Your Job With Your Personality©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The bulk of the losses followed a pair of catastrophic earnings reports, including the first quarter since 2011 in which its user base shrank. The stock fell 0.4% on Tuesday.The results raised questions about its ability to hold onto pandemic-era gains, an issue the cheaper ad tier could help address. The Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix projects the ad-supported offering will reach about 40 million viewers by the third quarter of 2023.“Netflix has already taken its medicine, and it has these catalysts ahead that are identifiable and that it can execute on,” said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank.Netflix has long resisted introducing ads to its service, preferring instead to count on must-watch content like “Squid Game” and “Stranger Things” to attract paying subscribers. But with consumers’ finances getting pinched by rising inflation, the company reported a massive customer loss this year. An ad-supported offering with a lower monthly cost could provide a new revenue stream and attract a wider user base.Even if ads aren’t a panacea for the company’s woes, the stock is more attractive as it offers both value and growth characteristics, said Klink.Story continues“It’s weird to think of Netflix as a value stock, but given the uncertain backdrop, a lot of portfolios would benefit from having a stock like this, that is both offense and defense,” he said.Oppenheimer was the latest firm to take a more positive view, writing Monday that the ad tier should accelerate subscriber growth. Evercore and Macquarie also adopted more bullish stances, with Evercore calling the ad offering “a clear catalyst on the horizon,” one that “can drive a material re-acceleration in revenue growth.”The consensus still leans cautious. Fewer than a third of analysts recommend buying Netflix, while more than half have the equivalent of a hold rating. At the start of the year, more than 70% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg had a bullish rating on the stock.Still, the growing optimism has supported the stock, burning short sellers. Since June 16, a recent closing low for the Nasdaq 100, Netflix is up 39%, compared with a 6.5% gain in the index. Evercore’s upgrade last week contributed to a 2.8% weekly gain for streamer, while the Nasdaq 100 had its worst week since January.Netflix’s valuation undergirds the bull case: Netflix trades 22 times estimated earnings, versus a 10-year average above 80 and the Nasdaq 100’s 20.6.Denny Fish, who manages the $4.4 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology and Innovation Fund, said Netflix’s valuation and prospects make it more attractive than other fallen market favorites like Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.“Growth has slowed, there’s more competition, but it might be one to be more comfortable with over the long term,” he said.Tech Chart of the DayThe selloff in tech stocks last week has shrunk the valuation of the Nasdaq 100 Index, bringing its projected price-to-earnings ratio in line with the benchmark’s 10-year average. Investors could dip back into the sector but they might stay cautious until the Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday.Top Tech StoriesApple Inc. unveiled major increases to its price tiers on apps and in-app purchases from Europe to Asia, protecting its margins as major currencies tumble against the US dollar.Apple is working on a software update for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max aimed at fixing a bug that makes the rear camera on the device physically shake when used with some third-party apps.Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter Inc., will be questioned under oath Tuesday in the social media company’s lawsuit against his longtime friend Elon Musk, according to court filings.Kavak, Latin America’s biggest startup, signed structured financing agreements with HSBC Holdings Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Banco Santander SA worth $810 million as it looks to expand operations amid a downturn in the tech industry.

It has amassed assets over $444.15 million, making it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for IQDF are 0.47%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 6.50%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) accounts for about 3.05% of total assets, followed by Roche Holding Ag Common Stock Chf 0 (ROG) and Nestle Sa Common Stock Chf 0.1 (NESN).The top 10 holdings account for about 18.87% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, IQDF has lost about -23.16%, and is down about -21.37% in the last one year (as of 09/22/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $18.82 and $26.20.The fund has a beta of 0.83 and standard deviation of 21.44% for the trailing three-year period, which makes IQDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 299 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $46.33 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $64.85 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The finding comes from one of the world’s largest studies of women’s well-being: the second annual Hologic Global Women’s Health Index.The report, released today, identifies many barriers to preventive care for women. These hurdles include struggles to find enough food and shelter, lack of educational opportunities and threats to women’s safety. They contribute to widening gaps in women’s well-being across high- vs. low-income countries, urban vs. rural areas, and highly- vs. less-educated individuals. The barriers also fuel record-high levels of worry, stress, sadness and anger among women worldwide.All 122 countries and territories evaluated by the Index have significant room for improvement in women’s health. The average global score was only 53 out of a possible 100, the highest score was 70 for Taiwan and the lowest score was 22 for Afghanistan.""The lack of progress and, in some cases, backward momentum justify an even louder wake-up call for world leaders to do more for women, whose well-being underpins the health of families, communities, societies and economies,"" said Steve MacMillan, Chairman, President and CEO of the global medical technology innovator Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX). ""Reliable data can ignite genuine change, and we look forward to engaging leaders worldwide to use the Index to champion women’s wellness.""Hologic partnered with Gallup, a leading analytics firm, to create the Index. For the second annual report, approximately 127,000 people worldwide – including 66,000 women and girls aged 15 and older – were surveyed during 2021 in more than 140 languages. This immense reach means the Index represents 94% of the world’s women and girls.Story continues""We’re proud to collaborate with Hologic to enable women to tell leaders about their health needs. As we jointly work with policymakers across the continents, we emphasize the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to elevating women’s well-being,"" said Gallup Managing Partner Vipula Gandhi.The Index provides a framework for achieving comprehensive progress. It looks at five interlocking dimensions of women’s health: Preventive Care, Basic Needs, Opinions of Health and Safety, Individual Health and Emotional Health. Together, these dimensions account for more than 80% of the variances in women’s life expectancy worldwide. They guide leaders in focusing on early detection and treatment of disease, creating stronger safety nets for life’s basic needs such as food and shelter, keeping women safe and investing more resources to increase socioeconomic equity.Shortfalls in these fundamentals bring about challenges that hinder women from making their health a top priority. About 85% of the women surveyed for the Index believe in the value of regular visits to a healthcare professional, but less than 60% of them had gone to a doctor, nurse, midwife or other health provider in the last year. Only 12% of women said they were tested for any type of cancer.""As a physician who has worked with patients in different corners of the world for decades, I’ve seen firsthand how early detection of disease makes a critical difference in lifespan and quality of life for women. But when women have to choose between getting healthcare for themselves and finding the next meal for their families, they will likely deprioritize their health,"" said Dr. Susan Harvey, Hologic’s Vice President of Worldwide Medical Affairs. ""It’s crucial for policymakers to see preventive care as part of a multidimensional, mutually dependent set of factors that should be jointly addressed.""To learn more about the Hologic Global Women’s Health Index, visit womenshealthindex.com.HOLOGIC GLOBAL WOMEN’S HEALTH INDEX: FAST FACTSWhat: One of the largest studies of women’s health in the world, created by global medical technology innovator Hologic and worldwide analytics leader Gallup. The second annual Hologic Global Women’s Health Index report was released on September 21, 2022.Scope: The latest report draws from a 2021 survey of 127,000 people – including 66,000 women and girls aged 15 and older – in more than 140 languages. This statistical sampling represents 94% of the world’s women and girls.Rankings: The Index assigns a women’s health score (from one to 100) to each of 122 countries and territories, and then ranks them. The average global score was only 53, and no country/territory scored higher than 70.Highest-ranking countries and territories: Taiwan, Latvia, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic, Israel and Norway.Lowest-ranking countries and territories: Afghanistan, Congo, Venezuela, Türkiye, Lebanon, Togo, Benin, Ecuador, Peru and Gabon.U.S. placement: score of 61, which ranks the country at #23.Essential screenings: 60% of female respondents (representing more than 1.5 billion women worldwide) said they weren’t tested in the last year for cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes or sexually transmitted diseases/infections. Only 12% said they were tested for any type of cancer.Healthcare disparities: The gap in Index scores between high- and low-income economies nearly doubled – to 22 points – between 2020 and 2021. In addition, the gap between urban vs. rural women widened to six points. As for educational disparities, the gap between women with an elementary education vs. those who completed at least four years beyond high school grew to 13 points.Emotional health: 43% of female respondents said they experienced worry, while 41% reported feeling stress, 32% reported feeling sadness and 26% reported feeling anger. All these percentages are record highs since the Gallup World Poll began tracking emotional health a decade ago (and incorporated the same tracking into the Hologic Global Women’s Health Index when it began).Basic needs: 37% of female respondents (representing nearly 1 billion women worldwide) said they at times lacked money to buy needed food for themselves and their families, while 30% (representing nearly 800 million women worldwide) said they at times lacked money for adequate shelter.About Hologic, Inc.Hologic, Inc. is a global medical technology innovator primarily focused on improving women’s health and well-being through early detection and treatment.

(HOLX) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-hologic-inc-holx-130001807.html,1663678801,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -7.6% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -61.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -30.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.49 indicates a change of -40% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $866.83 million indicates a year-over-year change of -34.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.78 billion and $3.79 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and -20.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.2%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $896.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.88%. The EPS surprise was +37.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With TikTok, its biggest goal was to reach “younger audiences that didn’t have that same emotional, nostalgic connection to the film that so many of the older audiences did,” De Palma said.“At every major marketing beat … it was really listening and learning to what that younger audience wanted from the film,” she said. “And of course the incredible aerial action and Tom Cruise was always at the top in what was most compelling, but what we really saw was that younger people wanted to see themselves on screen, and they wanted to see more of the new recruits.”Khartoon Weiss, TikTok’s global head of agency and accounts, noted that videos with the #TopGunMode hashtag on TikTok have more than 13 billion views — exceeding the Earth’s population. “That is massive,” she said. “That is fandom at its finest. That is literally repeat usage behavior, watching, engagement.”Film marketing is constantly evolving, especially in the digital realm, said De Palma. “But I do think we’ve seen a pretty seismic shift with the proliferation of TikTok over the last couple of years,” she noted. “I think it’s changing the way that we’re cutting creative. It’s changing the way that we’re working with creators… I feel like we’re constantly on the platform to see how people are expressing themselves.”Jonathan Helfgot, Netflix’s VP of film marketing, said the what the streamer sees with TikTok, probably more than with any platform ever, “is the necessity to show up as a fan first — and as a marketer second.” With TikTok users, “it’s a little bit more leaning in, rather than just, ‘I’m going to lean back and let this advertising talk to me.'” I think they want a little bit more engagement and a little bit more personality.”Story continuesFor Netflix’s “The Gray Man,” starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, the company enlisted the action film’s directors — the Russo brothers — for a behind-the-scenes series on TikTok, aimed at the #filmtok community on the app. The goal was “to harness the love that exists within the film community for the Russo brothers,” Helfgot explained.Helfgot borrowed the phrase “sprinkle chaos” from his colleague Kelli King, who heads TikTok strategy for Netflix, to describe the streamer’s approach to the short-form video app. “You can’t just take this thing that you’re going to put somewhere else and put it on TikTok,” he said. “You’ve got to sprinkle a little chaos on it,” clarifying that “It’s chaos with a point of view.”When partnering with TikTok creators, Helfgot added, “If you don’t understand the voice, and if you don’t understand the point of view, and you don’t understand what they make when they’re not necessarily getting paid by a brand, it’s not the right partnership.”TikTok’s Weiss said part of her team’s job is to educate marketers on how best to engage the community. “We talk about it by way of assets, not ads,” she said. “So if you think about assets not ads — a sound, a color, a character, a separate ending — all of a sudden you have multiple ways to actually bring your stories to life.”Undeniably, TikTok has cracked the content-algorithm code in becoming one of the biggest internet media platforms in the world. A year ago, the app announced it had more than 1 billion users worldwide — and today TikTok has somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.6 billion monthly active users, according to estimates by research firm data.ai.The “beauty of TikTok is it’s not about the following that these creators have amassed, it’s about the creativity that they bring to the platform,” De Palma added. “And it is so joyful to be able to be entertained and excited about the creators that we’re finding on the platform.”Earlier in the evening, a trio of entertainment-focused TikTok creators — Daphne Le (@daphnedtle), Emily Uribe (@emilyuuribe) and David Ma (@davidwma) — spoke about how to they approach content creation, fan engagement and brand deals on the platform, in a discussion moderated by Adrienne Lahens, TikTok’s global head of operations for creator marketing solutions.Uribe talked about her recent partnership with Lionsgate for “Moonfall,” creating “some really sick content” for the film that encompassed “crazy talk show videos.” Lionsgate’s team “took that and made me the moon in ‘Moonfall,’” Uribe said: “That’s a brand that reached out and knew the creator and their audience and what they do.”Ma recommended that when brands are dealing with TikTok creators, they should keep their marketing brief to one page that spells out the primary (and secondary) messaging as succinctly as possible, and that they should trust the creator to express that in their own voice instead of scripting it out. “When I see companies like Netflix or Disney+ and Marvel utilizing and leveraging their intellectual properties and their talent and bridging that world between where we see these stars on a big screen, and then seeing them in a TikToker’s video, it just connects that thread through,” he said.Le said that TikTok, from a marketing perspective, is “a great way for streaming platforms to have audience recapture because a lot of people are sharing content about existing IP that they love.” She said she was originally expecting to go to medical school “and then I blew up on TikTok and was able to work on TikTok full-time.”The Variety/TikTok Culture Catalysts Dinner was held at West Hollywood’s Soulmate restaurant. The event coincided with the inaugural Variety Entertainment Brand Marketing Impact Report, which profiles the most innovative entertainment marketing campaigns over the past year and the exec behind them.Pictured above (left to right): Netflix’s Jonathan Helfgot, TikTok’s Khartoon Weiss, Paramount’s Danielle De PalmaVIP+ Analysis: How TikTok Is Influencing Music TrendsBest of Variety13 Supporting Actors Who Successfully Campaigned for Lead Categories at the OscarsYour Pet Can Be Anyone They Want This Halloween, From Maverick to Winifred SandersonFrom Maverick and Rooster to Vecna and Eleven: The Best Couples Costumes to Wear This Halloween]"

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Townsquare Media has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Netflix has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that TSQ has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TSQ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 3.78, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 24.18. We also note that TSQ has a PEG ratio of 0.32. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.69.Another notable valuation metric for TSQ is its P/B ratio of 2.28. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 5.66.Based on these metrics and many more, TSQ holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of C.TSQ is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

(NYSE:DIS) has always been a leader in the entertainment industry. It is now working comprehensively on a digital strategy that will help power the future of storytelling.The media and entertainment giant has been investing in technology for many years, and its current focus is on creating new experiences that are interactive, immersive and customized. Disney is also using data to create more targeted content across its digital platforms. The company is committed to creating the best possible experience for its audiences, and its digital strategy will help it continue to be a leader in the entertainment industry.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISCEO Bob Chapek has said he wants to use the latest trends in technology to ensure Disney offers services no one else can. For instance, ge wants to use data from theme park visits and consumers' streaming habits to deliver personalized entertainment experiences.The most recent sign that Disney is looking to shake things up in the industry came when it appointed veteran media and tech executive Mike White, who has an accomplished track record, as head of the newly created Next Generation Storytelling unit. In this new position, White will be responsible for exploring all forms of future storytelling opportunities across multiple platforms.In recent years, the focus on data gathering and augmented reality, as well as new forms of entertainment, has fed into Disney's existing product lines, most importantly Disney+. It has emerged as one of the world's strongest streaming companies, largely due to the company's commitment to innovation. By continuing to invest in new technology and ideas, Disney is ensuring that its product will remain at the forefront of the entertainment industry for years to come.Disney lays out an aggressive plan for a digital futureThe Covid-19 pandemic dealt a heavy blow to Disney, but the company responded by adapting its businesses to the new normal. In particular, its streaming service became a big hit with families as the pandemic forced everyone to spend more time indoors. Disney+ is now the biggest streaming service provider in the world, beating out Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) with 221.1 million streaming subscriptions worldwide across its streaming offerings as of the June 2022 quarter.Story continuesMany companies would be happy with this situation. However, this is Disney we are talking about. It is never going to be content with its performance.From its early experiments in animation to its computer-generated imagery in blockbuster films, Disney has long been at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. The company is now working hard to incorporate augmented reality into its products. It has already developed mobile apps that allow users to see virtual characters and objects in their real-world surroundings. The Next Generation Storytelling unit is part of this strategy. The company also plans to bring augmented reality to its theme parks, allowing visitors to interact with Disney characters in new and innovative ways.However, Disney+ is the biggest area these digital initiatives will impact. Even though the streaming network was incredibly popular and successful from its launch, it is still struggling to generate profits. But the sharp growth in total subscriber numbers has helped keep Disney's stock prices high despite the pandemic, inflation and supply chain issues.In addition, Disney is increasing the prices of its streaming services. The subscription for ad-free Disney+ is jumping to $10.99 per month from $7.99 per month, while Hulu's ad-free streaming monthly fee will also increase to $14.99. The ad-supported version of Hulu will increase to $7.99 per month from $6.99 per month, while the ad-supported version of Disney+ will cost $7.99 a month when it launches on Dec. 8.If the consumer base remains sticky, then Disney+ will easily become profitable. However, the key in the long run is keeping consumers on the platform. Netflix has run into this problem and is suffering from quarter-over-quarter subscriber declines for the first time in its history. Disney could avoid this situation by investing in storytelling elements and new technology. It is trying to do that now with interactive units and augmented reality. As a prime example, Disney+ released an augmented reality short film, ""Remembering,"" starring Brie Larson. This could be a promising indicator of what is to come.TakeawayDisney has always been known for its ability to stay ahead of the curve. In recent years, the company has once again taken a leading role in the field of augmented reality as its streaming service allows users to experience Disney content in a whole new way.By incorporating augmented reality into its content, Disney is able to provide an immersive and interactive experience that is unlike any other. In addition to being a leader in augmented reality, Disney+ is also one of the most successful streaming services in terms of revenue generation. With its large catalog of popular films and TV shows, it has quickly become one of the most popular streaming services available.Disney+ will continue to grow as the company invests heavily in augmented reality-based storytelling and data analysis to create custom content. So far, the substantial growth in the number of subscriptoins for the streaming service indicates the growth story is going nowhere. As more people become interested in streaming services, Disney+ is well positioned to capture a large portion of the market.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PBF Energy PBF, Valero Energy VLO and Phillips 66 PSX.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Time to Buy These 3 Refinery Stocks Swamped by Oil's FallOil prices logged their third weekly fall in a row on Friday, dragged down by familiar fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth. Futures in New York settled at $85.11 a barrel, while Brent — the international benchmark — closed at $91.35. Both contracts have lost around 20% so far this quarter.With most Oil/Energy stocks highly dependent on commodity prices, it is no surprise that the pullback has resulted in downward pressure on the sector components. But based on fundamentals, experts see this negative price action as a transient stoppage in an otherwise strong energy environment, which continues to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine.In particular, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry seems to be one sub-sector that has become an unfortunate casualty of this oil slide. Even as fuel product supply remains constrained due to capacity rationalization triggered by the pandemic and demand continues to show strength on the pent-up desire for travel, some of the largest downstream companies have dropped precipitously over the past few weeks.    In other words, this presents a compelling buying opportunity in top-ranked refining stocks like PBF Energy, Valero Energy and Phillips 66.Refining &amp; Marketing Industry DriversWith the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, crude has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Story continuesAs it is, the downstream companies have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing vaccinations and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 6% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.As economic activity remains quite hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners have also benefited from increased summer driving and accelerating international travel.The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) have set all-time highs. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high.Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Buy the DipAll this adds up to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing group currently carrying a Zacks Industry Rank #8 — placing it in the top 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The group’s excellent position indicates fairly strong near-term prospects for its constituent companies.With the refining outlook looking up, savvy investors could use the pullback as an opportunity to buy their favorite stocks at a discount. We have narrowed down our search to three companies that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) but are down at least 7% over the past month.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, this Zacks Rank #1 firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF’s daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.    Over the past 60 days, Parsippany, NJ-based PBF has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 jump 51.6%. PBF Energy beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 78%.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO’s refining plants are located in the Gulf coast area, from where there is easy access to the export facilities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Valero’s 2022 earnings has been revised 11.7% upward over the past 60 days. VLO, headquartered in San Antonio, TX, has a projected earnings growth rate of 878.7% for 2022. It has a Zacks Rank #2.Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength. The company buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns interest in 12 refineries located in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.Over the past 60 days, this Houston, TX-based Phillips 66 has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 improve 11.9%.

F.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks Suitable for Value InvestorsThe price-to-book (P/B) ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and the book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. BorgWarner, Phillips 66, The GEO Group, Patrick Industries and Ford Motor Co. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Phillips 66’s operations incorporate refining, midstream, marketing and specialties, and chemicals. Phillips 66 is the leading player in each of its operations like refining, chemicals and midstream in terms of size, efficiency and strength.Phillips 66 has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.  Phillips 66 has a projected 3–5 year EPS growth rate of 12.27%.

The objectives were to demonstrate similar efficacy in terms of change in lumbar spine bone mineral density, as well as similar pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.The study met primary endpoints showing proposed biosimilar denosumab matched the branded drug in terms of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.Amgen recorded Prolia sales of $922 million in the second quarter of 2022, up 13% year over year.Osteoporosis is a promising space as it accounts for 8.9 million bone fractures annually, including debilitating hip fractures – a number set to increase substantially over the next two decades.The going has been good for Sandoz’ biosimilars pipeline. In July 2022, the company’s application for the proposed biosimilar of Tysabri (natalizumab) for the indication of multiple sclerosis was accepted for review by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). In June 2022, the EMA and FDA also accepted for review Sandoz's applications for the high-concentration formulation 100 mg/mL (HCF) of its biosimilar Humira.Shares of Novartis have lost 7.7% so far this year compared to the industry’s decline of 4.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, Novartis announced plans to spin off Sandoz into a new publicly traded standalone company to separate this business following a strategic review. This was because industrywide price competition among generic pharmaceutical companies and consolidation of buyers caused significant declines in sales and profits of Sandoz, particularly in the United States.Story continuesSandoz generated $9.6 billion in sales in 2021.  Concurrent with second-quarter earnings, management stated that the generic business showed signs of recovery.The separation will enable Novartis to focus better on its legacy pharmaceutical business.

In fact, PSEG’s Powering Progress vision sees a future in which people use less energy, and it’s cleaner and more reliable than ever.PSE&amp;G’s Environmental Projects and Services team is focused on ensuring the entire utility is working together to make this vision of a more sustainable operation a reality. To that end, and in alignment with our corporate sustainability and environmental priorities, we are focusing on a three-pronged strategy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving waste management and enhancing biodiversity.Greenhouse Gas EmissionsAs New Jersey’s largest energy utility, we play an important part in mitigating the potential impacts of a warming climate. PSEG is committed to continuing its leadership role in decarbonizing our economy and transitioning to a cleaner, safer, more equitable and resilient energy system – as we have for several decades. We are proactively supporting our emission reduction targets with methane reduction as one of the primary areas of focus for the utility.As of Sept. 1, 2022, PSE&amp;G has upgraded approximately 1,745 miles of cast-iron and bare-steel main, through Energy Strong and our Gas System Modernization Program. We’ve reduced approximately 200,000 metric tons of methane emissions, from the start of GSMP through the end of 2021. When the current phase of GSMP is completed by 2023, we expect to achieve an approximate 22% reduction in methane emissions compared to 2018 levels.Improving Waste ManagementAccording to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, municipal solid waste landfills are the third largest source of human-related methane emissions in the United States. In 2021, PSE&amp;G set an aggressive goal to reduce the amount of utility-generated solid waste that ends up in a landfill.Story continuesWorking with our operating groups, we have succeeded in diverting more than 95% of our solid waste away from landfills through properly segregating our recyclable material and finding recycling outlets able to accept as much of it as possible. EP&amp;S has assisted in diverting material from the landfill through donations/reuse. A few notable examples: three-ring binders from office cleanouts were donated to the Newark Board of Education, wood pallets were supplied to the Bergen County Fire Academy for training, and surplus wood was used to construct book nooks for the Camden County Pop Up Library.PSE&amp;G’s Biodiversity ProgramWe are especially proud of our work to protect the more than 130 threatened or endangered species that make their homes on or near the almost 1,300 miles of transmission rights-of-way (ROWs) that PSE&amp;G owns and maintains in New Jersey. The presence of these plants, animals and insects requires us to balance the responsibility we have to upgrade and maintain our transmission facilities with our obligation to ensure we do no harm to those species that call our ROWs home.In many instances our vegetation management activities create and sustain increasingly rare early successional and meadow habitats, providing important habitats for species dependent on them. In addition, PSE&amp;G formulated a seed mix to attract to our ROWs pollinators – such as bees and butterflies – that are so critical to New Jersey’s agriculture.Environmental Stewardship is an obligation we take very seriously, and the EP&amp;S team works in concert with our colleagues across PSE&amp;G to employ a variety of strategies and tactics to achieve our goals.We are all in this togetherPSE&amp;G’s EP&amp;S team includes experts in environmental science, remediation, compliance, land use, waste management, ESG and sustainability, who work to assess the potential impacts of our day-to-day operations and our large construction projects. We also work closely with environmental regulators and advocacy organizations that share our interest in preserving and protecting New Jersey’s environment.To read more about PSEG’s ESG efforts, visit pseg.com/esg.These are just a few of the many ways that PSE&amp;G is working to make our operations more sustainable. We know that our customers want safe and reliable electric and gas services, but we also know they want a healthy environment.

While this included some seasonal staff, those hires were mostly in full-time, year-round positions to cover COVID-19 absences. That led to overstaffing that dented Walmart's profits in the first quarter of 2022.This year's hiring is expected to bolster the company's online business and its in-store, delivery and pickup operations ahead of what is expected to be a subdued holiday shopping season. U.S. retailers face inflation, higher interest rates, a tight job market and supply chain snarls.Walmart's new workers this year will include seasonal U.S. store associates, truck drivers in full-time positions and service staff at call centers, Waggoner said.Amazon.com, Target, Macy's and Kohl's have not yet announced their holiday hiring plans.Holiday retail sales are expected to rise between 4% and 6% year over year from November to January for total sales of about $1.45 trillion to $1.47 trillion, according to Deloitte's annual holiday retail forecast released on Sept. 13.This compares with the 15.1% sales growth in the same period last year, when shoppers were flush with cash and eager to spend after months under lockdown.Declining demand for durable consumer goods, which had been the centerpiece of pandemic spending, will be a factor this year. Deloitte said inflation may boost total dollar sales but volumes will not rise commensurately.For example, 5% fewer online orders are expected this year compared with last year, as prices are expected to jump 15%, data from Salesforce's Consumer Sentiment Index in August showed.Story continuesHoliday shopping is also expected to start earlier than ever this year as ""stretched wallets create urgency,"" Salesforce said in its report.Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette echoed those comments, saying he expects holiday shopping to start in October.For example, Melanie Edwards of Detroit is planning to shop for her family this month, two months earlier than when she started last year.""With inflation not seeming to decline, I’m planning on shopping extra early this year. If I spot a deal before November, I'm going to jump on it,"" said Edwards, who works as a product manager at a soda company.Target, for example, is already advertising Christmas as a featured shopping category on its home page, where shoppers can find a small amount of holiday deals, deals tracking website Blackfriday.com said.At least three analysts told Reuters that Amazon's rumored https://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-prime-day-2-has-leaked-and-its-coming-later-in-the-year second Prime Day of 2022, likely to be held in mid-October, will unofficially kick off this year's holiday season. The first was held in July.Prime Days usually prompt rivals to offer their own deals and achieve a doubling in their online sales on that day, which is similar to what they achieve on Cyber Monday, a key day in the beginning of the traditional holiday shopping season, they said.

The Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, Columbus, OH has offered theValued at $414.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Sep 28, 2029.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in the land mission of the military. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. The recent clash between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunitions, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles for the U.S Navy. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.General Dynamics’ expertise and in-depth experience in building and supporting combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, have been helping it to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that, which in turn should boost GD’s revenue generation prospects in the coming days.Growth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any military missions and arm them in their land warfare affairs.In this context, per a report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 5.8% during the 2020-2025 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.A few defense primes that can reap the gains from the expanding armored vehicle market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.Story continuesBAE System’s Challenger 2 is heavily armored and highly mobile, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 9.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 24.2%.Northrop Grumman is the world’s top producer of medium-caliber live and training ammunition and gun systems, with more than five million units built in the last five years.

What's going on?INES FERRE: Yeah, Julie, and stocks are drifting higher. Of course, we do expect to see more fireworks today at 2:30 after Jerome Powell speaks. And also, sometimes the day after Fed day is where you see a lot of fireworks. But right now, we're looking at the Dow that's up about half of a percent. You've got the NASDAQ composite that's higher and the S&amp;P 500 up about 6/10 of a percent.You've got Treasury yields, which have paused their recent rally. So this is helping equities. So you're looking at the 10-year Treasury at 3.53, down about 4 basis points. Also, the US dollar index is at multi-decade highs. So this is putting a cap on how high equities are going because remember, we have seen recently that correlation where when the dollar goes higher, you're seeing equities go lower.But today, a little bit of a different picture because you're looking at industrials, which are higher. And that's because of defense stocks. Those are higher. I'll get to that in just a second. But look at that. Industrials is the leader right now, followed by real estate, consumer staples. You've got energy that's in the green as well. The energy has seen bigger gains earlier this morning, paring back some of those gains.Getting to where we're at with defense stocks, this has to do with the headline about Russia escalating the war in Ukraine. So we are watching defense stocks going higher. And I'm just going to pull up the chart here so you can see some of these gains. Lockheed Martin up more than 2%. You've got Northrop Grumman up also 3% and also as well as General Dynamics, Raytheon. You get the idea. I'm going to pull up, though, a year to date chart because you can see some of the year to date gains for these stocks, guys.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's own Ines Ferre continuing to track on the defensive space as well here. Appreciate the breakdown this morning.]"

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, sold US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$228 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$229. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's holding. Gregory Gallopoulos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.Gregory Gallopoulos sold a total of 21.77k shares over the year at an average price of US$233. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At General Dynamics Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at General Dynamics. In total, Senior VP Gregory Gallopoulos dumped US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of General DynamicsAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that General Dynamics insiders own 6.3% of the company, worth about US$3.9b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The General Dynamics Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold General Dynamics shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that General Dynamics is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing General Dynamics. While conducting our analysis, we found that General Dynamics has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.But note: General Dynamics may not be the best stock to buy.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.Technical TakeBTC falls, and the outlook is challengingBitcoin traded lower on Tuesday as investors reacted to a widely expected 75 basis point (BPS) interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, the rate-setting section of the Federal Reserve. Investors’ optimism was growing even before the announcement at the end of the FOMC meeting Wednesday. BTC’s hourly chart showed five consecutive hours of positive movement, leading into the start of the U.S. trading day.Bitcoin’s price rose as high as $19,900 before reversing course to current levels.So what’s next for bitcoin? The issues driving the Fed’s continued monetary hawkishness was more important than the size of the interest rate hike. Consider the following points specific to BTC’s outlook.The Fed stated plainly that inflation remains high, and the central bank is committed to returning inflation to its 2%. The bank barely mentioned the possibility of improvement in 2022.The federal funds rate is projected to increase to 4.4% by year’s end and close to 4.6% by the end of 2023, indicating equally aggressive rate hikes through the remainder of this year.Expectations for GDP growth range from 0.5% to 1.5% for 2023 and 1.4% to 2% for 2024, according to the FOMC.Estimates for higher, future interest rates and muted expectations for economic growth, are likely to present a hurdle for asset valuations. Thus, today’s report implies that bitcoin and other risk assets will continue to face challenges.Bitcoin/U.S. dollar daily chart along with its Bollinger Bands (Glenn Williams Jr./TradingView)Technically, BTC looks poised to trade flat, which has become an ongoing theme. As mentioned in Tuesday’s Market Wrap, BTC is trading relatively close to its “point of control” (POC), signaling that its price is close to where market participants have largely agreed that it should trade since January.Opportunities exist when an asset’s price deviates sharply from its perceived value, or new information presents itself that has not been incorporated in the price.An example of this would be the 10% decline that occurred on Sept. 13 as the price of BTC exceeded bitcoin’s point of control. Currently, the 2.5% spread between current price and a POC of $19,754, doesn’t offer a compelling enough opportunity, absent the emergence of a catalyst.Applying Bollinger Bands to BTC offers a similar view. Bollinger Bands measure an asset’s 20-day moving average, and plots two standard deviations above and below that average. Statistically, an asset’s price is expected to remain within two standard deviations of its average, 95% of the time.An asset’s price breaching the upper or lower limit of its Bollinger Band often signals the price has moved too far in one direction. BTC’s current price in comparison with its 20-day average implies that it is trading close to fair value for the moment.Altcoin RoundupStrengthening Ether-Nasdaq Correlation Muddles Post-Merge Bullish Plays: Cumberland: The Merge has skewed demand-supply dynamics in favor of the bulls.

But comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who stated that more aggressive measures were needed to curb inflation, rattled markets with the prospect of tighter monetary policy.Powell said the central bank is now willing to risk weakness in the economy and the labor market as it moves to rein in inflation. Other major central banks are also expected to hike rates to curb high inflation, with the Bank of England set to act later today.On Thursday, London-traded Brent oil futures fell 0.4% to $89.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures dropped 0.3% to $82.72 a barrel by 20:39 ET (00:39 GMT).Rising rates, coupled with heightened inflation, are expected to weigh on crude demand by eventually slowing economic growth. High interest rates also limit the spending ability of consumers, weighing on gasoline demand.Strength in the dollar, which hit a 20-year high on Thursday, has also dented overseas crude demand this year by making oil imports more expensive.Fears of these trends have dragged oil prices down from annual highs hit during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. Measures by the U.S. government to lower fuel prices have also flooded the market with crude, as the White House steadily drew from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this year.But an escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict could further disrupt Russian crude supply, indicating a potential upside for prices. President Vladimir Putin this week announced a partial mobilization of troops to “annex” certain Ukrainian territories.Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine had caused oil prices to skyrocket in February, given that major consumers in Europe and Asia rely heavily on Moscow for supplies. Tightening supply, particularly as the war escalates, could push oil prices higher.Story continuesA harsh European winter is also expected to boost crude demand as more countries switch to heating oil.Related ArticlesOil Slips Below $90 as Rising Interest Rates Dim Demand ProspectsGold Loses Steam, Copper Sinks Further as Hawkish Fed Boosts DollarU.S. Senator Manchin unveils energy bill that some Democrats slam]"

WYNN and Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD.Industry: GamingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1982982/3-gaming-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-challengesThe Zacks Gaming industry is gradually recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. Although the industry is benefiting from improving visitation in Las Vegas, dismal visitation in Macau is hurting it. The Macau recovery remains slow and it is still unclear when the market will return to its pre-pandemic level. However, robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry. Stocks like MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts, Ltd. and Boyd Gaming Corp. are likely to gain traction from this upbeat demand.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Gaming industry includes companies, which primarily own and operate integrated casinos, hotels and entertainment resorts. Some industry players also deliver technology products and services across lotteries, electronic gaming machines, sports betting and interactive gaming. Some industry participants further develop and operate gaming establishments as well as associated lodging, restaurant, horse racing and entertainment amenities.Some companies are also involved in developing and selling gaming applications. Additionally, e-sport or sporting event or tournament services, content management system, video software, mobile applications and e-sports data platform solutions are provided.Key Themes Shaping the Gaming IndustryVisitation Still Below Pre-Pandemic Level: Traffic persists as a major concern for the gaming industry since the coronavirus pandemic. However, the industry is gradually coming out of the woods despite a dismal performance in Macau still hurting the industry. Easing of local COVID-related restrictions helped gross gaming revenue (GGR) to rebound in August to $271 million compared with $49 million recorded in July. However, the figure was well below the August 2019 figure of $3 billion and also down 50.7% year over year.Story continuesFor the first eight months of 2022, Macau’s GGR declined 53.4% year over year and 85.4% compared with the same period in 2019. In 2021, Macau casinos’ performance was better than the 2020 reading but still well below the pre-pandemic level. In 2021, Macau’s gross gaming revenue (GGR) totaled $10.82 billion, up nearly 44% year over year. However, the 2021 annual figure was still 70% below the pre-pandemic tally. Notably, companies continue to focus on the level of services and staffing with selective amenities, and enhanced safety and social-distancing protocols in the gaming floor to welcome gamers.U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenues Make Record: The gaming industry in the United States is recovering faster than anticipated. Per the American Gaming Association data, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $53 billion in 2021. Gambling was already flourishing in the United States until the pandemic had struck in early 2020. Previously, in 2019, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $43.65 billion. In July 2022, U.S commercial gaming revenues came in at $5.06 billion, up 2.8% year over year. Gaming revenues surpassed the $5-billion mark four times in the last five months. Through July, commercial gaming revenues touched $34.27 billion, up 15.5% year over year. The U.S. gaming industry will continue to improve.Sports Betting a Major Driver: The legalization of sports betting in Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Montana, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois and New Hampshire has been driving growth for a while. Moreover, bettors can now place wagers via the digital platforms in Connecticut, Kentucky, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, California, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and other states.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

And we're watching casino stocks that are mostly in the green, as China drafts rules to make it easier for some foreigners to enter China for visits along the border to tourism sites. Now, Caesars is the outlier here, I'm pretty sure because Caesars doesn't have a business in Macau, right? Caesars is just US. So that's why it is not benefiting from this lift that the others that do have strong Macau businesses are seeing here.And we're also hearing that Hong Kong is gonna end some of its COVID restrictions, like mandatory hotel quarantine. So that also could be helping matters. By the way, Wynn got a big boost yesterday after Credit Suisse reinstated its coverage of the stock with an outperform rating. So this is day two of this little casino rally we're seeing.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it absolutely goes to show the importance for these companies of making sure that tourism, especially in some of the areas where-- and for the players that are more internationally-focused, where there is a reliable name that a tourist would see in a place such as China and in Macau, particularly, where they might go to say, you know what? I know that experience.And that particularly is what investors would look at to see exactly where that kind of globalization effort that's been pushed forward by some of the casino operators over years now is set to pay off and benefit them, because of that name recognition, that brand equity. And so with that in mind, you're seeing potentially even more of the reopening.And especially in China. This is such a key growth area for a lot of the casinos as well in ensuring that they can actually monetize on tourism as that is starting to be able to have a clearer pathway to come back into the region.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, in the case of a Wynn, for example, 40% of its sales come from Macau, specifically.

Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.I'm Alan Murray and I'm here with the G.O.A.T. of co-hosts, the greatest of all time, Ellen McGirt.Ellen McGirt : Alan, you're working in the animal puns. That is fantastic. Well done. I did not see that coming. You know, I love these introductions. They are my favorite part of my day. But here's the thing that I love even more and I know that our listeners can't see this of course but you are actually live in person with our amazing guest today. I'm so sorry I can't be there.Murray:  I am. I think it's the first time this has happened since February of 2020. I am in our lovely padded podcast room and very excited about it.McGirt: Well, you know, who also should be there today, are your amazing dogs who, anybody who's been on a Zoom call with you in the last two years have met and fallen in love with. I'm sorry, they're not there.Murray:  I'm sorry they're not here too. I haven't been able to convince this building in Manhattan to let them in. But our guest today is Kristin Peck who is the CEO of Zoetis. It's a Fortune 500 company, makes medicine, vaccines, other products for household pets and livestock. And Cooper and Remy take her medicine once a month for ticks, fleas and heartworm. So I'm very familiar with the company and the product. Big company by the way, Ellen. Market valuation of over $70 billion. Sells about $7 billion a year in product.Story continuesAnd Kristin, we're very excited to have you here and you must have pets right?Kristin Peck:  I definitely have pets. It's great to be here. Thanks so much for having me.Murray:  Just quickly, tell us about your pets.Peck:  Okay, so I have two dogs and a bird. Although I would say I have a lab rescue named Poppy, who's about 12, and then I guess it's a dog but I call it a barking cat, Sky. Mostly because it has the attitude of the cat and it's got the, you know, the hunting skills of a dog and Sky is a mix, sort of like a cavachon.Murray:  And how does Sky feel about the bird?Peck:  You know, believe it or not, I think Sky and the bird have a quite interesting relationship. I think if the bird ever, you know, got out Sky would for sure chase it but Sky is very intrigued by the bird. I don't know how I feel about the bird but the bird definitely likes Taylor, so...Murray:  I don't want to get too lost in that because we have a lot to talk about. We're going to talk about global food shortages. We're going to talk about the future of work. We're going to talk about the power of purpose, which I know is one of your favorite topics. But before we do any of that, I want you to tell us about pandemic puppies.Peck:  Yes, so I'm very grateful for all those people out there who adopted pets but clearly not as grateful as some of them. So what we saw in 2021, in particular, was about a five to 10% increase in the number of pets and you know, most of everybody, has a friend or a family member who has a pandemic puppy or a pet. And really a lot of those pets were adopted by millennials. So their are real changes, a lot of people getting more than one pet so obviously it was great for business for us. It led to our best year ever. But I think really the bond between human and animals became even deeper during the pandemic.Murray:  There was some fear that if people started to go back to work, some of those pets would be abandoned. Have you seen any of that?Peck:  I have not. We actually as a leadership team just did a volunteer day at St. Hubert's [Animal Welfare Center] in New Jersey, and we've been asking most of the shelters, both my children actually volunteer. They have not seen that, you know, we were expecting it. Their rates are about what they used to be. And we think really the reason there is that most people who adopted them already had a pet. And you know, I know you want to bring your pets to the office, as you mentioned, but most people aren't coming back five days a week, so they're still spending a lot of time home with their pets.McGirt: I have a quick question about how people interacted with veterinary care during the pandemic. What did you see happen with veterinary telemedicine? Was that a breakthrough?Peck:  It's a great question. In the beginning, we thought it really was going to be a game changer. It was a little bit more of a challenge in the veterinary space than in the human space, because it's regulated by the state as whether or not you can have your first appointment online. What we've seen is it's really been a nice addition but it hasn't been a game changer.What really was was curbside check-in. So if anyone who has a pet probably remembered, you know, you just pulled up,  you dropped off your pet and you came back an hour or two later when the pet was ready. And I think that allowed them to ensure you know, a safe environment for their staff and for the pet owners.Telemedicine has you know, become important but it's not at the same level as you see in human health. Primarily because it's harder to ask a pet how they feel. You kind of, not seeing the pet can be a challenge. I do think there's still opportunities for it and it will grow over time. But it wasn't what we saw actually in human health.McGirt: So interesting. Although it'd be very entertaining for my vet to watch me attempt to give my cat a pill. I feel like it would...Peck:  Yes, pilling a cat is...you wouldn't be the only one.McGirt: Can we talk about your early days as a CEO? As you know from your work and your advocacy, there are way too few women in the top spot at companies so it's a very big deal. And you had only been there for a short period of time when the world shut down. Can you talk to us about how your 100 day plan changed and what some of the breakthroughs or innovations that may have come from that?Peck:  My predecessor was an absolutely wonderful gentleman, Juan Ramón Alaix, and he was the role model for what I thought a CEO,  a beautifully formal, you know, great communicator, warm person. And I thought that's what were the expectations for me. I imagined my first year traveling the world visiting my sites. We're a very global company. Half our businesses is outside of the U.S. And I did, you know, I took over in January 2020. I had about, not even two months before everything changed and where the plans had to change. We had to pivot as an organization. It was, you know, for every CEO whether you'd have the job or not, no one had a playbook. But in certain ways, you know, maybe I'm a frustrated optimist, but it allowed me to rewrite the book on what it was going to be like for me to be a CEO and to lean into styles that might have been more comfortable for me but not what I thought my colleagues expected or what I thought the world expected of me.I was a working mom with two kids at home and very soon I had one with serious medical issues and it was hard to separate during those early months in March, April, May and June being a working mother with being a CEO. And I think it helped me relate to where my colleagues were, and to prioritize what mattered probably faster than I would have expected. I was very connected with colleagues interestingly, more than I probably would have been had I traveled the world.Murray:  Did you talk about it at work?Peck:  I did. And not initially, because I thought that I was supposed to be...Murray:  That's not what people did before.Peck:  Yeah. I thought I was supposed to be the everything goes really well in my life. I you know, but like, you know, I started realizing what people were struggling with was creating routine for their family. So I started doing posts on LinkedIn. Here's the schedule we put on the chalkboard in my kitchen. You know who's cleaning the toilets? When are we eating? What are we going for a family walk? And the more I did it, the more I saw my colleagues really respond well to it. And it was you know, my big thing was we may all be in the same storm, but our boats are pretty different. So let's find out what your boat looks like. You know, are you single at home and you're lonely? You know, are you managing very young kids? Are you worried about your parents? What was it that was making it challenging for you and how as the CEO could I create policies, benefits and leadership that supported you? Because we needed, the thing was the pets still needed care. And the farm animal still needed care. So I still had to be able to operate a company and engage colleagues.You know, as you pinpointed, that's a big change in the way CEOs act—men and women—showing vulnerability, projecting more empathy. Do you think that's just a was a temporary phenomenon related to the pandemic or do you think that's changed is going to continue?I think the change is going to continue partially because the workforce is evolving. So I look at our workforce today, 50% of our colleagues are millennials and their expectations of the values of their company, the engagement of their leaders, hey want to work for a place where they think the company and their leadership share their values. And so I think what you're seeing is their expectation is they want people who are more empathetic, who really engage with them in a very different way, communicate in a different way.So, look, I think every leader has to find what works for them. And where their comfort zone is. And as long as they're vulnerable and authentic, and that really has to do with how authentic that is. I mean, we've all seen the ones who throw it out there and didn't seem so authentic. And we you know, people certainly judge those. So I do think it's an opportunity for leaders to, whatever is their full self, to bring that and people sense if that's, you know, if they're hearing what they're seeing.McGirt: So let's pivot. I'm curious how you're thinking ahead and planning ahead for what might be coming next. We're seeing climate change accelerate. We're seeing disease and other disruptions related to weather increasingly impacting human life. Certainly animal lives, certainly livestock lives. How do you think about the long-term future and the kinds of investments you need to be making now.Peck:  Sure, I think one of the things that has, you know, always driven Zoetis is our purpose, which is to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals. And that means really bringing disruptive innovation to the market, because healthier animals on the livestock side are more sustainable animals. So we really think about how do we contribute to a world of the livestock side where we can help animals be healthier, because a healthier animal is more efficient and it's better for the environment. Because as you look to the future, there's 8 billion people today it's expected there'll be about 10 billion by 2050. That's 2 billion more people that need to eat healthy food with less resources, hopefully, then we're using today to produce the food that we're using. And so we feel a real responsibility when we look at the livestock side is how do we help create that environment and that's partly by being able to genetically decide which animals are going to be healthier and breed the ones that are less likely to get disease, making sure we better understand which animals do better in which environments and then vaccinating, them keeping them healthy so you don't use antibiotics, because sick animals are using resources but not gaining weight.But it's the same on the pet side. We say that if you look back about 30 or 40 years, the pets were in your backyard. Then they entered your house and now they're on your bed and millennials feel even more attached to their animals. So where's the world going? How do we create products and services and diagnostics that help us as we look to the future, have a deeper relationship with pets, keep them healthier, and for livestock create a more healthier sustainable food supply? And, you know, I just got back the last time I sat down with you, Alan, from Africa, and we're partnering with the Gates Foundation there to figure out how we can create more sustainable agriculture around the world. So they can produce food closer to them, that's better for the environment, and that's ensuring they have access to products, most importantly, access to training. What does it take to keep an animal healthy? And diagnostics so they know the diseases they're treating for and they're only using the products that are going to be effective versus not knowing and throwing everything at the animal which, again, isn't good for the environment and isn't necessarily good for the animal either. So we do feel a true responsibility to help create that future.Murray:  There is kind of this great cow debate going on, right? Where certain people who care about the environment, who care about sustainability, think cows are bad. It just takes a lot more resources to feed a person through beef and it has a big effect in terms of methane emissions. How do you think about that? What's your view of the role of cows in the environment?Peck:  Sure. You know, I think as you look at the important role that milk plays in the health of human beings around the world, and meat, I very much respect anyone's choice to eat however they wish. I do think to think that you're never going to have cows is probably you know, not a realistic and my responsibility is to ensure that I can keep cows as healthy as possible, and I can find more sustainable ways of raising them. And that I can limit the methane emissions and the footprint. And there's lots of articles that say, you know, a world where you fully move to pure agriculture without animals is no more sustainable but we need to find a different way of coexisting and it is our responsibility to work with producers around the globe, to figure out what that looks like. And we take that very seriously. But I think the belief that the world isn't going to be eating any animal protein, first of all the data doesn't support it and if you look at what it's going to take to feed the world, we're going to have to figure out how to raise everything more sustainably. And over time, it may be that, you know, people move over long time I mean, 10 20 30 years, more to poultry or to fish, but I don't believe a world, I'm not imagining a world where you're not going to have a lot of cows out there. Producing the milk and meat that we need.[Music]Murray:  I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, who is the CEO of Deloitte US and has the good sense to sponsor this podcast. Joe, thanks for being with us. And thanks for your support of our second season.Joe Ucuzoglu:  Thanks, Alan. Pleasure to be here.Murray:  Joe, we talked about technology adoption accelerating in 2020. But at the same time, it also seemed last year like there was an increased focus on people, on human capital. Can we hope for a future where we have both more technology and more humanity all at the same time?Ucuzoglu:  I'm particularly energized leading a large professional services firm where people are at the core. This is all about marrying great people with innovative technologies. It's not about replacing one with the other. It's allowing people to free up more of their time to do what humans do best. The technology is an enabler for great people to use their creativity, their complex judgment and decision-making skills. But at the same time, I think we have to recognize that getting this right definitely requires a new kind of corporate leadership. I would say out with the autocratic, all-knowing CEO sitting in the corner office, and in with those who bring vulnerability, empathy, humility, those are such critical attributes to unlocking the creative talents of the workforce in such a dynamic economy.Murray:  It is very different when you're trying to get a group of creative people to solve a problem than when you're simply giving orders and telling them what to do.Ucuzoglu:  It requires a brand of leadership that places a premium on instilling values, instilling principles, and empowering people to be able to make those judgments on the front line, instead of waiting for some checklists or waiting for some prescriptive order from corporate that spells out exactly how each of those decisions need to be made.Murray:  Joe, thank you.[End music]Murray:  So the Russian invasion of Ukraine has put severe stress on global food systems. I wonder what you're seeing and what you're doing to address that.Peck:  It is a real issue as you look at the effect of the inability to get significant exports out of, particularly Ukraine, but partially Russia as well. It's about 20% of the calories that the world needs come out of there. And it's a much higher percentage for people in Africa and specifically sub-Saharan Africa. And you know, when I was down there in Uganda with a number of members of my leadership team, figuring out how you can create more sustainable production, closer to home where there's less dependence on some of these major green export markets, other food sources, has been really important. It's something we're really focused on and as we look at our foundation at Zoetis, investing and ensuring that we can create more sustainable agriculture closer to home around the world, not just in Africa, but in many communities around the world. I do think as you look at the war in Ukraine, we're quite focused as we should be on energy and fuel. But I do think the food crisis and ensuring we can help support not just Russia but also colleagues in Ukraine, but colleagues who are dependent on the food that's coming out of there around the world is going to be an increasingly important part. And I think many CEOs are now starting to focus on thatMcGirt: Kristin, you mentioned sustainability and harmonious interactions, and ecosystem health. All of these things that we're talking about are increasingly a part of what leaders and CEOs are talking about when we think about stakeholderism, stakeholder capitalism. I know this is important to you. I know you think about this a lot by virtue of your role in the Business Roundtable. Could you give us a report card or pulse of how you think this is all going? I know that we're talking about it a lot, and I know that we're spending a lot of time talking about metrics and measurements. How do you think things are going?Peck: My view is stakeholder capitalism is investing in creating value for the long term of companies. I don't think it's a fad. I don't think it's going away. I think it's what any responsible CEO is doing. I firmly believe, for example, that your colleagues have to come first. If you're investing and engaging your colleagues and creating an environment, you're going to attract the best talent. The best talent will deliver the best performance, will make sure that your customers are taken care of. And they want to work for a company that is going to take care of the environment, that's thinking about the problems ahead. And that's investing to succeed not just today, but tomorrow. I, you know, I think a lot of people and I know you write about this all the time Ellen in the CEO Daily, and I read in Fortune, there's a lot of talk of will this pass as we hit a recession? And I don't think it will, it certainly won't for us. You know, we put our metrics out there and those metrics are around creating value. They're not because we're a charitable organization. [inaudible] At the end of the day when I sit down with our large shareholders. That's what they're asking: What are you doing to invest in the future? Where is innovation going? And that is, as I look at the environment, creating a place where my colleagues feel engaged. These are all really important things and being a company my customers want to do business with. And by the way, I have very varied customers across the political spectrum, but they want to know, my customers in a rural area know that consumers care where their food came from, and they're going to want to invest in that. So I think it's here to stay. And I you know, I can't speak for every CEO but when I go to BRT meetings or other CEO gatherings, it is what CEOs are focused on.Murray:  What about the growing political backlash, the you know, charges that you're a bunch of woke CEOs and you're engaging in politics and you should stay out of it? You now have the state of Texas actually, you know, is talking about passing laws to prevent BlackRock from it investing in the state because of its ESG principles. How do you think about this politicization of the issue?Peck: It is really challenging in markets, even beyond the U.S. around the world. I think we're more divided in any given country that I visit or that we operate than we've ever been before. I don't think it's the job of CEOs to take sides. It's the job of the CEO to say what matters to their colleagues, their customers and their industry, and to support policies and programs that do that. It's hard, sometimes, you know, to have someone accuse you of different things, you know. As a member of the BlackRock board, I obviously fully support, you know, BlackRock's position. I don't agree with the state of Texas on this. But it's hard sometimes not to have our opinions or our policies be brought into it. But I think you've got to make sure that you stick to what matters to your company, that you can clearly articulate how it relates to the purpose your colleagues and your customers if you're going to take a stand. It's challenging, but I think it's long beyond the U.S. I mean, I was in Chile, and [inaudible]. I think whether or not you're in Brazil, Chile, Europe, this division is really important and I think it's important that companies try to stay out of the fray, but stay principled to their purpose.Murray:  Yeah, it is difficult. I mean, politics has become more and more about taking positions and business people like yourself just have to be practical and solve problems to do what's right for the company. I want to change the topic a little bit to one that I know you've thought about a lot and care about a lot. We have a lot of people on the show whose employees primarily work in offices. That's not the case for you. So how are you thinking about post-pandemic work, and how the rules of work have changed?Peck:  I do think fundamentally, the rules have changed. I think colleagues of all different types expect different things from their employers today than they did before. We did implement policy at Zoetis called empowered flexibility. And that was for all colleagues and it looks different for jobs. But the concept behind it is, you know, all colleagues should be able to have flexibility wherever they can to do their job, but it starts with what does my team need? What is the business need? What is the customer need? And what do I need? And what that looks like is going to be quite different. I operate in labs, for example, R&amp;D Labs, where you have to do the experiment in person. So maybe that's four days intensely and one day where I write up my reports. We have lots of manufacturing workers that produce products, distribution systems. You know, maybe that's the ability to get one day a week, you know, switch your shift around so that you can attend a doctor's appointment or go to take care of your parents. We have to imagine it differently. We had our best year ever in a world where wherever colleagues were office based or you know desk based. They worked from home so I think it starts with trusting your colleagues. But it's having a real conversation about why and being intentional about why we're in person versus when we're not. But recognizing that I have 40 to 50% of my colleagues that are always going to be, you know, in sort of what I call deskless jobs where physical presence is required. And a field force that has to be out on farm or out in clinics all the time caring for animals and supporting their customers. So it's not the same as companies who run fully desk space. And so, to me, it starts with engaging your colleagues and to the pandemic, our engagement rates have been 80 to 89% for 2020 2021 and 2022.Murray:  Just to be clear at your company, everyone will come out of the pandemic with more flexibility than they had going into it?Peck: Correct.McGirt: When I when I think about the future of work, I'm worried that women and people of color are just not going to be there. The pandemic was just bonkers for women. I mean, you shared it with your own personal story with your kids at home as we shut down. And I just see it across the board, particularly for lower-wage earners. We're losing them, they're leaving the workforce and they're going to be gone forever if there aren't bigger interventions. So what's your best advice? Or how do you think about the kinds of policies or leadership required to meet the needs of women, especially working moms and other represented groups going forward?Peck:  Ellen, I share your your concern on this topic for a few reasons. One, I think as you look at the number of women we lost to the workforce over the last two to three years, really concerns me. It concerns me because if you're taking out 50% of the talent base you know, you just don't have the quality of what you have to look at. It's also really important as, you know, I'm on the board of Catalyst as well, supporting, you know, women's economic success and minority economic success is absolutely critical. Part of what we're trying to do is offer that flexibility because what different women and minorities want is actually quite different. Some people found the ability to work remotely in boxes on a screen very equalizing. My concern though is if those people largely stay at home and other people come back, do you create a disequal world where those that come back and are in the office get more attention and their careers move faster then those people who for family reasons, whatever still are in, you know, working from home? And I think we're learning as we go, I think what we know now will evolve is for example, we now make a rule even if half the people or three quarters are in a conference room, they each have to be in a box.Murray:  So you bring your computer in the conference room, use the room note the audio system...Peck:  We use the room audio system, so no one has audio. It forces people to look at the computer screen, so they don't feel like they're missing out and the people in the room aren't focusing on each other and not on the screen.Murray:  I think that's really, I mean, we're talking tactics here but it's a really effective tactic. We do that sometimes and I've found that now after the meeting, I can't remember any longer who was in the room and who was on the computer because because it is equalizing. Are there other tactics like that that you've adopted to help ensure that we don't move into a world where the people at home become second class citizens?Peck:  I think it's just constantly talking about it being clear that I don't see either one is better or worse, that we need to back back then for some people, they really want to be in the office. It works better for them. Actually, some, you know, mothers or fathers with very young children want to be in the office. And so the key is saying there's certain meetings we're going to do in person and being clear about what those are. But if not, there is nothing that's better or worse, and then we just have to run talent processes that ensure that we do that.I think it's going to evolve over time. I also think, you know, we've increased our diversity statistics significantly, we've increased women in leadership positions 3%, people of color by 2.5% since 2020. So through the pandemic, we've improved all of our numbers, but it's being intentional about that intentional on you know, ensuring slates for all jobs are diverse, and also interview panels are diverse and really thinking about job requirements. I think that's another thing we've really got to really look at: what does it take to really succeed at the job do you need every degree that you said you needed? How many years of experiences you really need to get these jobs? So we're being super intentional about it. And as a result, we're keeping high engagement and we're attracting more diverse talent to our roles.McGirt: So you know, you are really busy board member and you've got such an impressive resume. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about how board service has changed or is changing? What that might mean for somebody who's qualified in all kinds of ways but who may have been overlooked in the past? How should they prepare to join a board or contribute in that way?Peck:  I really enjoy being part of a board and I think it's been critical to my development. And I strongly encourage my leadership team at Zoetis to search out board opportunities and I support them in trying to find them because I think it helps you understand that many of the issues that we face as CEOs and senior leaders are very common across, whether it's customer experience, the future of work, cyber, it could be ESG, they're all very common and learning from other people. And to me, it's supporting the company that you're on the board of, but also learning from your other board members, how their companies are approaching it and hearing different perspectives about doing that. So I think it's really important. I think it's getting harder to be a board member the expectations of the topics you need to spend time on, that you need to get up to speed on, it is a significant commitment. You know, our policy at our company is no more than one board because to do it well takes a lot of time.Murray:  You know, I was having this conversation with a group of directors yesterday. I think one of the things that probably needs to change, the standard for board positions a few years ago was, I want a retired CEO, you know somebody who has actually been in the job but isn't doing it anymore so they have the time to give to my company. And the problem with that is, and Ellen and I talk about this all the time, is things are changing so fast past, a CEO who retired five or 10 years ago is really out of touch with what's happening out there. And you'd be better off having somebody who's in the fray.Peck:  Well to be honest, that's the board member I just added. I felt exactly the same way that you did, and so did our board, which is some of the challenges that we're facing the pandemic, you name it, the war and we were really excited to add Vanessa Broadhurst from J&amp;J to our board, who's a current executive there, because the advice that I had during the pandemic of picking up the phone and calling Frank D'Amelio at Pfizer and saying, how are you handling the supply chain issue? I'm struggling with this. You know, what are you doing about that? It was so valuable to me to have someone on my board who was struggling with some of the same issues and in between board meetings to be calling and checking up on these issues. So I think the point that you're raising of really being more open minded to C-suite executives are currently operating. More boards are finding value in that and honestly, on BlackRock, we have a lot of them and it's such a valuable part of the discussions we have.Murray:  It's good to hear. Before we let you go, we've got to go back to pets. The last three years have been sort of crisis on top of crisis on top of crisis and one of the crises has been a mental health crisis. The numbers that come out of companies, the percentage of employees who have been disturbed by the events of the last three years by isolation, by whatever risks, the people they're caring for, it's huge. What do we know about the value of pets in human mental health?Peck:  They're incredibly powerful. So I think your intuition is dead on. We support something called HABRI, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute, that's actually quantifying the benefits and the clinical significant benefits for not just mental health, but cardiovascular health. But as you look at mental health, for example, it gives people purpose. You know, I have a 99-year-old grandmother and I will tell you, she's alive today because, getting up every day to walk her dog gets her walking thinking about the cardiovascular, knowing she matters, knowing that animal lives or dies based on whether or not she cares for it. I think as you look at why so many people adopted pets and have kept them is that like, they don't judge, they're happy to see you when you get home. They want to snuggle with you. You know that they depend on you and that if you don't get up and do things, that they're not going to be okay. I think it has incredible mental health benefits. But there's also, we believe, the physical benefits so much so that we're starting a movement to try to ensure that flexible spending accounts can cover veterinary care, because we believe the ability to care for your animals medical care is critical to your emotional mental health.Murray:  That's great. Thank you so much. And thank you for keeping my dogs healthy.Peck:  Thanks so much for having me.Murray: Leadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergalla, written by me, Alan Murray, along with my amazing colleagues, Ellen McGirt and Megan Arnold.

(TAK) and Zoetis (ZTS). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that TAK likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ZTS has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TAK currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.88, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 30.56. We also note that TAK has a PEG ratio of 0.54. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.67.Another notable valuation metric for TAK is its P/B ratio of 0.84. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 15.63.Based on these metrics and many more, TAK holds a Value grade of A, while ZTS has a Value grade of C.TAK has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ZTS, so it seems like value investors will conclude that TAK is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They are pictured here with their sons, Peyton, 12 (left) and Jackson, 17 (right). Source: ZoetisThe company was also named to Seramount’s Best Companies for Dads list for the second year. Both awards reflect Zoetis’ commitment to providing colleagues with a range of family-friendly benefits and flexible work arrangements.""At Zoetis, we believe it is essential to offer inclusive benefits for colleagues and their loved ones as we create a culture and workplace where our colleagues can thrive. Paid gender-neutral parental leave, phase-back programs, childcare access, bereavement leave after miscarriage, reimbursement for fertility expenses, and mental health benefits are just a few of the programs recognized by Seramount,"" said Roxanne Lagano, Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer and Global Operations. ""We also understand how important flexibility is when it comes to leading a balanced and productive life, and we are committed to making flexibility a lasting part of our culture. We are honored to once again be named one of Seramount’s 100 Best Companies and a Best Company for Working Dads.""A.J. Edge and Daniel Edge Named Zoetis’ Working Parents of the YearAs part of the 100 Best Companies recognition, Zoetis named A.J. Edge and Daniel Edge, DVM, its 2022 Working Parents of the Year. Together for 20 years and married for 13, A.J., Marketing Manager, and Daniel, Director of U.S. Petcare Medical Affairs, are fathers to two adopted sons, Jackson, 17, and Peyton, 12.Story continuesAdvocacy and AllyshipAs active members of the company’s Proud and Welcome (PAW) Colleague Resource Group for LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies, A.J. and Daniel are strong advocates for diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as in the veterinary profession. As part of his membership in PrideVMC, an association for veterinary professionals who are part of the LGBTQ+ community, Daniel played an active role in promoting the organization’s Gender Identity Bill of Rights (GIBOR), a document that states the rights of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons, and provides guidance on how workplaces can support their employees by identifying and eliminating discriminatory practices. In partnership with members of PAW and the Zoetis Human Resources team, Daniel helped raise the GIBOR document to the company’s executive team for their visibility, resulting in the company signing the bill. ""Zoetis has consistently expanded health and wellness benefits over the past few years to be more inclusive for all persons, including support for those across the full LGBTQ+ community spectrum. Becoming a signatory was further affirmation that Zoetis values diversity in all current and future colleagues,"" said Daniel.The couple also makes it a priority to teach their children what allyship looks like, and the inherent good that comes from supporting others and advocating for change. ""As a family, we’ve volunteered in our community, attended rallies and other advocacy meetings and even sent our oldest son on a volunteer mission in Guatemala as a means of exposing them to other people, communities and areas of the world. Our belief is that regardless of what you look like, where you came from, and even who you love, everyone deserves our love and support,"" said A.J.Advice for Other Working ParentsWhen asked what advice they would give other parents, A.J. noted that giving up on perfection can really help. ""As a working parent, you have to step back and realize that it’s not always going to be perfect, and that is ok. But you can still accomplish everything that you want to -- and feel good about that at the end of the day."" Daniel added, ""As a parent, you are also a teacher to your child, whether you embrace that or not. The learnings I want my children to take away from me are gratitude for the experiences that we have in life, and appreciation for others.""Watch A.J. and Daniel’s story here.Learn MoreRead more about Seramount’s 100 Best Companies and Best Companies for Dads.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. BJ, NextEra Energy Partners LP NEP, Alliant Energy Corp. LNT, Potbelly Corp. PBPB and ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. ARR.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top U.S.-Focused Stocks Amid Surging Interest Rates and U.S. DollarWall Street has been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022, barring a two-month summer rally. Market participants continue to be affected by the after-effects of COVID-19 even though the infection has itself dwindled. These, along with the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and shortage of labor, have caused the inflation rate to skyrocket to a 40-year high.In order to combat galloping inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance unseen since 1994. Rigorous hiking of the benchmark interest rate and the adoption of a tighter monetary policy have resulted in a surge in U.S. currency.A higher interest rate regime has already raised the value of the U.S. dollar in the international market. At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in stocks of domestic-business-oriented companies with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are — BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc., NextEra Energy Partners LP, Alliant Energy Corp., Potbelly Corp. and ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc.Surging Interest RateThe U.S. inflation rate is currently at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed raised the Fed Fund rate from 0-0.25% in early March to 2.25-2.5% in July. Yet, there are no signs of inflation cooling down. After back-to-back FOMC meetings in June and July, the Fed is set to hike the interest rate by another 75 basis points in September.Story continuesA section of economists and financial analysts is expecting the central bank to raise the rate by 1% in the September FOMC meeting. Moreover, the Fed terminated the pandemic-led $120 billion of bond-buying program per month in March and has started reducing the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet from June.Consequently, the yields of U.S. government bonds soared. As of Sep 19, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.518%, its highest since April 2011. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.949%, its highest since 2007. This yield is most susceptible to the Fed’s rate hike strategy. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.521%.Dollar-Index SkyrocketsAs interest rate surges in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets in order to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed in 2022.As of Sep 19, the DXY closed at 109.586, climbing 14.6% year to date. The index is currently at its 20-year high. With respect to the U.S. dollar, the British pound is at a 37-year low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Further, currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low level against the U.S. dollar.Why Domestic- Focused Stocks?Market participants are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Domestic business-oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shock since the United States is the lone market for their products.Despite the recent economic slowdown, aggregate demand in the U.S. economy is rock solid. Americans have more than $2 trillion in savings in the last two pandemic-ridden years. The Fed is trying to cool demand by an aggressive rate hike and liquidity reduction from the system to combat higher inflation.In order to fund expansion, these companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers. This makes them less sensitive to the interest rate movement and will help them to outperform the broader market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five domestic business-oriented U.S. stocks that have solid potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.BJ's Wholesale Club’s ability to steer the tough retail environment validates its strong customer value proposition and business model. BJ’s relentless efforts to boost membership base, simplify assortments, enhance digital capabilities and accelerate club openings should support sales. We foresee sustained improvement in membership fee income as new club openings ramp up.Markedly, BJ's Wholesale Club’s acquisition of the perishable supply chain from Burris Logistics puts it in an advantageous position to scale up supply chain capabilities and expand fresh food offerings. A jump of 6% in member count in the second quarter speaks about BJ’s ability to drive traffic. We estimate a 14.3% and 7.1% increase in total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively.BJ's Wholesale Club has an expected earnings growth rate of 10.8% for the current year (ending January 2023).

The problem is the definition of what makes a company blue chip varies. Some believe it’s consistent and increasing dividends. Others look to bottom-line profits or rock-solid balance sheets. In other words, it’s subjective. Rather than spend excessive time settling on the best criteria for determining blue-chip stocks to buy for safety,  I’ve selected seven names that appear in the holdings of one or more of the following blue-chip exchange-traded funds: Monarch Blue Chips Core ETF (BATS:MBCC), T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:TCHP) and Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (BATS:FBCG).As always, I’ll ensure that the selections provide reasonable sector diversification. In addition, the stock must have a positive annualized total return over the past one-year, three-year and five-year periods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven blue-chip stocks to buy for safety and reduced volatility.NEENextEra Energy $84.79LLYEli Lilly$308.89AAPLApple$150.70TSLATesla$303.35UNHUnitedHealth Group$521.02SOSouthern Company$77.25COSTCostco Wholesale$504.14NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is not only one of my favorite utility stocks but also one of my favorite stocks, period. It’s a traditional power company through Florida Power &amp; Light, the country’s largest electric utility with more than 5.7 million customer accounts. It’s also the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar through its NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary. NEE has delivered an annualized total return of 2.9% over a one-year period, 17.8% over a three-year period and 19.5% over a five-year period, all significantly better than the S&amp;P 500.The company reported excellent second-quarter results in late July. Operating revenue of $5.18 billion was 32% higher than a year earlier. On the bottom line, operating income of $948 million was 86% higher than a year ago. Story continuesAnalysts expect earnings per share to increase 12.6% this year to $2.87 and 7.7% next year to $3.09. Based on its current share price, NEE stock trades at 29.5x 2022 earnings and 27.4x 2023 earnings. Add in a 2% dividend yield and I’m not sure how you couldn’t like NEE stock.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is an Indianapolis-based large-cap pharmaceutical company.  Ten years ago, its three top-selling drugs by revenue were Zyprexa (for treatment of schizophrenia), Cymbalta (for the treatment of depression and anxiety) and Alimta (for the treatment of lung carcinoma). Today, the company’s top three drugs’s are Trulicity (for diabetes), Taltz (for psoriasis) and Verzenio (for breast cancer).     As we discovered during the pandemic, the drug companies — typically viewed by consumers as uncaring, overcharging money machines — turned out to be lifesavers. Hopefully, the balance between overcharging and undercharging can be found in the future by federal and state governments. In the meantime, Eli Lilly is doing just fine. In 2021, it had slightly less than $6 billion in free cash flow ($7.26 billion net cash provided by operating activities less $1.31 billion in purchases of property and equipment). That means it converted 107% of its net income into FCF. Anytime you go above 100%, you’re doing a lot right in your business. Forget the growth, or lack thereof, in recent quarters. These things go in cycles as the drug pipelines develop.Over every period, long and short, it’s delivered for shareholders with an annualized total return of 35.5% over a one-year period, 42.5% over a three-year period and 31.5% over a five-year period.Apple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comI thought about putting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy for safety over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, it’s down 19% over the past year, so it doesn’t meet my criteria. AAPL stock is up 1.9% over the past 12 months. And its three- and five-year annualized total returns are 40.1% and 31.1%, respectively.   Apple is Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) largest equity holding by a country mile for a reason. CEO Tim Cook keeps coming up with good ways to generate and grow revenue and profits. In March 2017, I said Apple was a value play: “Currently, Apple stock’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $52.5 billion or $9.72 per share; an FCF yield of 6.9% based on its March 27 closing price of $140.88. By comparison, Microsoft has free cash flow of $3.49 per share for the trailing 12 months or an FCF yield of 5.4% based on its March 27 closing price of $65.10.”Today, Apple’s and Microsoft’s FCF yields are 4.4% ($107.58 billion in TTM FCF divided by $2.42 trillion market cap)  and 3.6% ($65.15 billion TTM FCF divided by $1.83 trillion market cap), respectively. While they’ve both gotten more expensive over the past five years, Apple remains the value play of the two. However, I don’t think MSFT is a bad bet if you can afford to buy both.Apple has excellent free cash flow and a strong balance sheet and possesses structural tailwinds that should be sustainable in a slowing economy, Treasury Partners Chief Investment Officer Richard Saperstein recently told Barron’s. In short, AAPL stock is as blue-chip as they come. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comIt’s hard to believe Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considered a blue-chip company, but the numbers don’t lie. Over the past three fiscal years, the electric vehicle maker’s operating income has grown more than 8,000%, from $80 million in 2019 to $6.5 billion in 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, Tesla’s been generating operating profits since June 2019.The business has gotten so brisk that the company is considering opening a gigafactory in Ontario or Quebec to take on some of the company’s manufacturing needs for North America. According to reporting from Electrek, Canada’s Minister of Industry and Innovation Francois-Philippe Champagne is rumored to have visited Tesla’s California plant as part of the current discussions to make a Canadian plant a reality. As a Canadian, I think that’s a wise idea. Canada has an automotive history that dates back to the early 1900s.Tesla wants to produce 20 million vehicles annually in North America by 2030. A factory in Canada would certainly help make this possible. The company says it needs eight more factories to meet its goals. While there are many reasons why someone might buy Tesla stock, the fact that it’s been able to cut its cost to make each vehicle from $84,000 in 2017 to $36,000 today is a big reason why it’s become so profitable.   With annualized total returns of 20.2%, 165.6% and 64.3% over the past one-year, three-year and five-year periods, respectively, I wouldn’t bet against Tesla. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comThe second of two healthcare companies on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy for safety, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), is a leading provider of healthcare-related services through four operating units. United Healthcare provides healthcare benefit plans to millions of Americans through employer and individual plans. Optum Health provides basic healthcare services through more than 60,000 affiliated physicians. Optum Insight is the company’s tech unit that provides data analytics and consulting to the healthcare industry. Lastly, Optum RX is the company’s pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacare business. Together, the four businesses generated revenue of $80.3 billion and operating profits of $7.1 billion in Q2, up 13% and 19%, respectively, year over year. Management expects full-year 2022 adjusted EPS of $21.65 at the midpoint of its guidance. Based on its current share price, it trades at 24.1x its projected 2022 earnings, slightly higher than its five-year average.Every once in a while, the subject of universal healthcare is raised by politicians and investors get nervous that, if this were to happen, UnitedHealth would be out of business. That’s unlikely. Switzerland has universal coverage that’s required by law. Private insurers provide basic coverage with supplemental insurance available for additional services not covered by the basic plans. Analysts love UNH stock. Of the 26 covering it, 22 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” and the average price target is $585.91, 12.5% above the current price. Shares have delivered an annualized total return of 26.5% over a one-year period, 31.8% over a three-year period and 22.4% over a five-year period. Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comSouthern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second of two utilities on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy for safety. The Atlanta-based company serves 9 million customers in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and elsewhere through seven operating subsidiaries.  The company’s second quarter was good, with operating revenue of $7.2 billion, 38.6% higher than a year earlier. Over the first six months of the year, revenue increased 24.7% to $13.9 billion. Revenue was higher due to increased fuel costs and an exceptionally warm second quarter, which led to higher electricity use for air conditioning units. Excluding one-time items, earnings for the second quarter were $1.14 billion, 28.4% higher than a year ago. In the six months ended June 30, they increased 12.6% to $2.18 billion. Southern Company added close to 12,000 residential electric customers during the second quarter and an additional 7,000 customers for gas. In Q2, 48% of the energy used to serve its customers was natural gas, followed by coal (20%), renewables (17%) and nuclear (15%).In early August, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission permitted the company to begin operating Vogtle Unit 3, the utility’s 45.7%-owned nuclear reactor in Georgia. Three other utilities own the rest of it. Unit 4 is still under construction, but it’s expected to be operating by the end of 2023. They are the only commercial reactors being built in the U.S. at the moment. Unit 1 of the Vogtle plant has been in operation since 1987. Vogtle 2 went into service in 1989. Once all four are operating, nuclear power should become a more significant piece of the Southern Company pie, surpassing coal. That’s a good thing. SO stock has delivered an annualized total return of 22.3% over a one-year period, 12.4% over a three-year period and 12.2% over a five-year periodCostco Wholesale (COST)Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock PriceSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best stories in retail. The company’s membership warehouses continue to see a growing customer base of loyal shoppers. Yielding less than 1%, investors don’t buy COST stock for the dividend. However, over the past year, shares delivered a total return of 9.5%, almost 24 percentage points higher than the entire U.S. market. The three- and five-year annualized return numbers are even more impressive at 21.9% and 26.6%, respectively. Given our inflationary times, Costco’s value proposition makes it even more attractive as a long-term buy. Historically, the company has made most of its profits from its annual membership fees, passing on savings from suppliers in the form of lower prices.  In August, the company’s same-store sales increased 10.1% year over year, with retail sales of $17.55 billion in the month. Excluding gas and foreign currency exchange, its same-store sales increased 8.7%, with a substantial 11.7% increase from its Canadian locations. For the 52-week fiscal year ended Aug. 28, Costco’s revenues rose 15.9% to $222.7 billion. As far back as 2012, I’ve been a big fan of Costco. It operates one of the world’s best businesses. Part of the success is the business model. However, it ultimately comes down to the people. Costco’s talent separates it from other discount retailers. COST is a buy whenever you have money to invest in blue-chip stocks. In my opinion, it’s in a league of its own.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Set up in 2019, the hub was established in sync with MA’s efforts to drive digital transformation across Egypt and pursue significant investments in recruiting local workforce.The regional center commenced operations with a skeletal staff of six very able employees and gradually absorbed more than 60 experts in three years. Plans are afoot to further bolster the headcount within a couple of years.The team leverages real-time data, analysis, consulting and marketing solutions to extend cutting-edge financial and payment solutions that are witnessing growing popularity these days. These are related to Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL), open banking, cybersecurity and data monetization. With these solutions, regional clients and those from all over Europe, the Asia-Pacific and the North American markets can boost prospects of their businesses.The team’s efficiency can be well reflected in the Mastercard Advisors Client Services Hub’s completion of more than 200 engagements within a short span of less than two years. Such efforts of team expansion at the hub clearly underline Mastercard’s endeavor to cater to the regional and global markets from its Egyptian base and subsequently, pool in strategic investments by foreign firms into the country.Similar moves reinforce Mastercard’s continuous efforts to strengthen its footprint as a leading technology provider by rolling out innovative payment solutions across Egypt. A solid digital suite built through several collaborations with renowned financial service providers and substantial investments is expected to position MA well in tapping teeming opportunities amid the flourishing digital payment space of Egypt.Undoubtedly, the African nation seems to seriously woo overseas investors like the global digital payment processor Mastercard.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Mastercard's current trading price of US$314 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Mastercard’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Mastercard What Is Mastercard Worth?Great news for investors – Mastercard is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $453.83, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Mastercard’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Mastercard?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 55% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mastercard. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.71%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.18%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 11.34% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 12.12%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 8.68%.Qualcomm will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Qualcomm is projected to report earnings of $3.15 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 23.53%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $11.38 billion, up 21.91% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.47 per share and revenue of $44.17 billion. These totals would mark changes of +46.02% and +31.58%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Qualcomm is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 10.01. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.71, so we one might conclude that Qualcomm is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 0.63 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Wireless Equipment was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.84 at yesterday's closing price.The Wireless Equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, putting it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

250,7e65354e-2680-3e68-9540-7be90650b299,QCOM,2022-09-22,Is Trending Stock QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-130001573.html,1663765201,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Qualcomm (QCOM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -11.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 12.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share, indicating a change of +23.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.47 points to a change of +46% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.74 indicates a change of +2.2% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $11.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.9%. The $44.17 billion and $46.6 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +31.6% and +5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $10.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.7%. EPS of $2.96 for the same period compares with $1.92 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.5%. The EPS surprise was +3.5%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He said plenty of room is left for innovation.Kern noted that the major online travel agencies still only control around 20 percent of a “multi-trillion dollar” travel market. “Those are all opportunities” to build partnerships with the thousands of offline travel agents, he said.“I think there is plenty of growth for all of us,” Kern said.Ali asked Kern if mergers and acquisitions will be part of the playbook. Expedia Group sold its corporate travel business, Egencia, to American Express Global Business Travel in 2021.Kern said acquisitions are not a “first and foremost” priority for Expedia Group now, but once the company completes the restructuring it has been working on for the last couple of years, then it will be in a position to make deals if there is something interesting to acquire.In addition to launching a new Expedia Group-wide loyalty program, most likely next year, the company is placing a lot of emphasis on further developing its business to business arm to provide supply and technology to business partners, including banks, loyalty programs and even influencers. The AARP and Hopper are among Expedia’s partners.Expedia Group is creating “micro services” that partners can use, including fraud detection technology, service capabilities, and machine learning tech, Kern said.Story continuesThe company’s business to business initiative is a “very big business for us,” Kern said, adding that it was a “nearly $20 billion throughput business” for Expedia Group in pre-pandemic 2019.It has “lots of pieces,” Kern said, and Expedia Group is currently transforming what was initially intended as enterprise technology into products and services that are suitable for smaller entrepreneurs.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Editor-in-Chief Tom Lowry interviewed Diller. Neil van Niekerk / SkiftBarry Diller isn’t a fan of work from home, but has apparently been overruled on the issue by leaders at this companies — as well as employees.Diller, the chairman and senior executive of both Expedia Group and IAC, where working from the office and from home form a hybrid mix, told the audience at the Skift Global Forum in Manhattan Tuesday that working from home is “kind of stupid” and “a crock.”There is hardly any innovation to be had ”sitting at a laptop computer at a dinning room table,” Diller said in a discussion with Skift Editor-in-Chief Tom Lowry.Diller said work from home has been “imposed” on his companies, mostly because of tech firms pushing the idea.He argued that it was insane to ask employees in surveys what they think of working from home versus coming to the office, but people at his companies reminded Diller that they would lose lots of employees if they mandated showing up at the office five days per week.Expedia Group opened a new $900 million headquarters with 600,000 square feet of office space in the fourth quarter of 2019, months before the onset of the pandemic.Diller Praised Expedia Group’s ReorganizationDiller praised the multiyear effort to simplify operations at Expedia Group, where there were “seven checkout paths” at different brands, and endless duplication.The company is “redesigning every single crook in the machine,” he said.When Lowry asked Diller if he was satisfied with the pace of change at Expedia Group, Diller quipped he would never say he was satisfied. “That would just make the people who work for me happy,” he said.Most Sustainability Programs IneffectiveIn other highlights of his on-stage interview, Diller said “the mass of them [Environmental Social and Governance programs] are truly empty calories,” although he added that some energy companies are getting them right.He noted that Expedia Group is promoting alternative destinations to tourist spots that are “overrun,” but Diller said he doubted that these sorts of things would have a deep impact on sustainability in travel.Story continues“I don’t think this ESG movement has amounted to much,” he said, except in producing “glossy” reports.Corporate Travel Will Be BackDiller predicted corporate travel will be back to a semblance of its former self, probably in 2024.“There is an imperative to see your customers and to be out in the world,” Diller said.Business leaders will implore their chief financial officers to provide adequate budgets to make business travel happen, he said.Grim Prospects for U.S. Democracy in 2024Diller said he worries that ex-President Donald Trump would be reelected in 2024 to the peril of democracy in the U.S. — or that Republicans would contest the legitimacy of the election if Trump runs and loses.“It is incomprehensible to me that we would reelect Donald Trump but we might,” he said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $51.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure the final 51 Advanced Capabilities Mission Computers retrofit kits to meet the Navy’s mission requirements for the EA-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this contract will be executed in Bloomington, MN.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in programs related to a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification work.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Given Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, the company has been witnessing a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime, anywhere and under any conditions.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 25.1% in the past year.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%.

What's going on?INES FERRE: Yeah, Julie, and stocks are drifting higher. Of course, we do expect to see more fireworks today at 2:30 after Jerome Powell speaks. And also, sometimes the day after Fed day is where you see a lot of fireworks. But right now, we're looking at the Dow that's up about half of a percent. You've got the NASDAQ composite that's higher and the S&amp;P 500 up about 6/10 of a percent.You've got Treasury yields, which have paused their recent rally. So this is helping equities. So you're looking at the 10-year Treasury at 3.53, down about 4 basis points. Also, the US dollar index is at multi-decade highs. So this is putting a cap on how high equities are going because remember, we have seen recently that correlation where when the dollar goes higher, you're seeing equities go lower.But today, a little bit of a different picture because you're looking at industrials, which are higher. And that's because of defense stocks. Those are higher. I'll get to that in just a second. But look at that. Industrials is the leader right now, followed by real estate, consumer staples. You've got energy that's in the green as well. The energy has seen bigger gains earlier this morning, paring back some of those gains.Getting to where we're at with defense stocks, this has to do with the headline about Russia escalating the war in Ukraine. So we are watching defense stocks going higher. And I'm just going to pull up the chart here so you can see some of these gains. Lockheed Martin up more than 2%. You've got Northrop Grumman up also 3% and also as well as General Dynamics, Raytheon. You get the idea.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA.Details of the DealValued at $228.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2027. Per the deal, Textron will provide the H-1 Light/Attack helicopter with new and modified capabilities through System Configuration Sets.In particular, as part of this contract, Textron will work on the airframe, aircraft wiring interface terminals, flight controls, and weapon systems interfaces, as well as research alternatives. The company will also offer all efforts required to accomplish an analysis of alternatives, system design, integration, testing, rapid response activities and system capability improvements.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have also been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe bumped-up defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunitions of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to expand at a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This is likely to benefit Textron, with its Bell segment consistently innovating combat helicopters as well as upgrading the existing models to expand in the military rotorcraft market. In March 2022, Bell submitted its final Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) proposal revision to the U.S. Army and expects to receive the contract in October 2022.The growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Story continuesLockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft for U.S. armed forces along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations.

This comes on the heels of a report that builder sentiment is down for the ninth straight month. Jay McCanless with us, Wedbush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research.Good to see you, sir. So we talk about that number, up 12%. On the other hand, building permits are down 10%. It's a little bit confusing. Is there some reason for optimism in there?JAY MCCANLESS: You know, thank you for having me. I think part of the issue with starts being a little delayed is supply chain, both on-- in terms of developing the land to get it ready to put the home on and then actually getting the home. constructed itself. As the parts and pieces become available, the builders are going ahead and starting.I think the slower permit growth is a function of what you talked about with higher mortgage rates, maybe builders being a little more cautious until we figure out where mortgage rates are going to settle out. I also think that the builders already have a lot of homes that were underway. And, again, now that they're starting to get the parts to get them built and get them constructed, they may be slowing down a little bit of the forward production until they can catch up in the field.SEANA SMITH: Jay, speaking of those higher mortgage rates, what do you think demand destruction potentially looks like? And how long do you see this challenging landscape here for housing lasting?JAY MCCANLESS: Yeah, I wish I knew when the mortgage rates were going to stop going up. It's been a pretty challenging environment, certainly the highest rates we've seen in years. What we did see in August when rates stabilized for about-- or late July and early August, rates stabilized for about six weeks. That started to help bring some buyers back in.Story continuesWho knows where mortgage rates are going to go this time around. But if we could find a level and stay there, even if it is a higher level, that helps people figure out what their monthly payment is going to be, and conversely helps the builders, I think, generate more-- more web traffic and foot traffic to start people on that home buying journey.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Jay, I want to ask about the neutral rating on Toll Brothers and the $50 12-month target that you have for them. Talk about some of the issues that are at play and what you think might potentially turn it around.JAY MCCANLESS: Yeah, we're cautious on-- we like Toll Brothers, the company, but we're cautious on the stock right now just because that higher-end consumer, which Toll, that's their focus are luxury and higher-end consumers, that consumer seemed to have pulled back more in terms of confidence and willingness to buy a home than what we saw from some of the entry-level builders in the June and July earnings season.So until we see that higher-end customer maybe a little more willing to step out and get a home, which we've seen it from some of the other builders, too, but that's, I think-- when we-- ahead of the June earnings cycle, the expectation, at least on my part, was that we were going to see maybe the entry-level consumer pull back a little bit, but that move up in luxury consumer would be able to ride out this change in rates.And it's actually been the opposite. That entry-level, needs-based buyer who is growing their family, needs more space, that buyer, if they can find a payment that works for them and a home that works for them, they are going ahead and making the move. Whereas that higher-end consumer is being a little more hesitant right now. So that's the reason behind the neutral rating for Toll at this point.DAVID BRIGGS: Most of the big home builders are down in the neighborhood of 30% on the year. Contrast that with what you see in KB Homes and why they outperform.JAY MCCANLESS: So KB does about 55% to 60% of their quarterly volume in entry level. Their entry level, though, is more of a, call it a tweener, not really a spec smaller home to a home that a person can customize. We like their model. We like the fact that they focus on that 55% to 60% entry level because, again, that's where the demand seems to be.Going into the print, we are ahead on earnings. But we do think that orders may be a little bit softer this time because, as opposed to some of what we call the speculative home builders, which are homes that are started without a sales contract, people who it may take six to nine months with their KB Home to receive it, they may be a little more hesitant to buy right now. Whereas with the three other names that we like, Meritage, Century, and Horton, they do have homes that are available for purchase within 60 days or less.And the buyers seem to like that right now, because they can go ahead and lock in the rate on their mortgage, have an idea of what their payment-- monthly payment is going to look like, and I think that may give those three names a bit of an advantage right now versus KB. But, again, we do like the entry-level exposure. And as that buyer who may have a little more-- a little more money saved up or maybe a little higher income demographic, once that buyer starts to return to the market, we think KB is going to benefit from that.SEANA SMITH: Well, Jay, it certainly is a very tough environment, a deteriorating environment for the housing sector right now. What do you think the impact will be on this space? Do you think we could potentially see consolidation as a result?JAY MCCANLESS: You know, I haven't really seen consolidation in a couple of years. And I think, given the opportunities that some of the builders have in the single-family for-rent space, it wouldn't surprise me if we see some of the production that was going to go to for sale move to for rent. I can't rule out consolidation. But there are so many investors and dollars being earmarked and targeted to go into that rental market, I think there's plenty of construction to be had out there. It may just not be exactly what the builders had anticipated coming into this year.And I think, also, you look at the competition for-- to for-sale housing, multifamily rents are still moving up 15% a month. Single-family rents are moving up 15% to 20% a month. So we think the overall shelter demand is still very high. It's just some of the builders may need to reset pricing and/or help out on the rate side to get people into those homes.But when we look at the demand and the demographics, with the millennials being such a larger population that's fully in household formation mode right now, and you compare that to 2009 when we had too much inventory and not enough buyers with the Gen X generation, I think from a demand and a shelter demand standpoint, we're set up much better this time around than we were during the GFC.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Jay, you mentioned multifamily projects. That was actually one of the bright spots in the home builder data. And that's, of course, being driven by some of the strong demand for rental properties. Are there certain companies that are in a better position to capitalize on this than others?JAY MCCANLESS: Yeah, the two that we covered that play in the multifamily market-- or build in the multifamily market are DR Horton-- or sorry-- three, DR Horton, Toll Brothers, and Lennar, all three of them build multifamily projects to one extent or another. DR Horton has also started their own single-family for-rent division, where they're building whole communities, leasing them up, and then selling them in to investment funds.And most of my other builders that I cover have started to move into the single-family for-rent space, either through joint ventures or doing some sales directly to investors. So, yeah, multifamily and single-family for-rent, again, those are other revenue opportunities for the builders. But to multifamily specifically, especially with some of the really strong rent growth we've seen in that market, Toll, Horton, and Lennar are going to be our most immediate beneficiaries.DAVID BRIGGS: It seems to be where the trends are headed. Jay McCanless, appreciate you being here. Thank you.]"

Barring the readings for April and May of 2020 (when HMI fell to 30 and 37, respectively), the September 2022 reading of 46 marks the lowest level since May 2014.A score below 50 indicates poor industry conditions in most builders’ view.Persistent supply-chain disruptions, moderate inventory levels and higher material costs are hurting homebuilders’ confidence levels. As a result, homebuilders are increasing prices regularly, leading to affordability issues.High home prices, above 6% mortgage rates and back-to-back interest rate hikes make it difficult for entry-level and first-time buyers to indulge in such activity. The Fed is likely to conduct another meeting this week and may announce the biggest interest rate hike. Since March, it has lifted the rate from near zero to 2.25-2.50%, currently.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has declined 22.9% in a year, underperforming the Zacks Construction sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s fall of 17.7% and 12.4%, respectively.Ninth Straight Month Fall of Confidence, Housing Slowness PersistFor this month, all three HMI components fell sequentially. Current sales conditions decreased three points to 54. Both buyer traffic and sales prediction for the next six months fell one point to 31 and 46, respectively. The HMI gauge of tepid future sales expectation signals slow housing demand this year.NAHBImage Source: NAHBThe three-month moving averages for the regional HMI reading were also down in each region. Northeast dropped five points from the prior month to 51. Midwest fell five points to 44, South fell seven points to 56 and West declined a notable 10-point to 41.NAHB chairman, Jerry Konter, a home builder and developer from Savannah, Ga, stated, “Buyer traffic is weak in many markets as more consumers remain on the sidelines due to high mortgage rates and home prices that are putting a new home purchase out of financial reach for many households.” Konter added, “In another indicator of a weakening market, 24% of builders reported reducing home prices, up from 19% last month.”This year, homebuilders have loosened confidence month over month. Since January, it has declined 37 points now, supporting the signs of a housing recession, thanks to elevated construction costs and an aggressive monetary policy. The declining trend has provoked more than half of the builders to think about incentives like mortgage rate buydowns, free amenities and price reductions to boost sales.Story continuesWill Housing Regain Momentum?Per the market pundits, housing is unlikely to regain this year as the prevailing market condition is not showing signs of recovery. Recently, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported in its Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey, for the week ending Sep 9, that activity declined to the lowest level since December 1999 from the previous week. Activities will decline more in the future as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has gone up to 6.02% for the week ending Sep 15, marking the highest reading since 2008 and essentially double the year-ago figure.In addition to the above-mentioned data, inflation rose 0.6% after adjusting for energy sources, and prices of building materials rose 0.5% in August from July. These factors are enough to setback from housing activities.Leading homebuilders like Lennar Corporation LEN, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, KB Home KBH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, Meritage Homes Corporation MTH and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL have witnessed lower order and backlog during their last reported quarter and has reduced their expectation for second-half 2022.Although these stocks have gained 3.54%, 3.33%, 3.17%, 2.77%, 2.61%, 2.38% and 2.11%, respectively on Sep 19, the tepidness persist.A Brief Outlook of Above-Mentioned StocksLennar, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company, is about to post its quarterly numbers on Sep 21.

(NYSE:BAX) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/88-institutional-ownership-baxter-international-122409451.html,1663763049,STORY,['BAX'],"[A look at the shareholders of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Baxter International. Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Baxter International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Baxter International. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Baxter International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Baxter International. The company's largest shareholder is Wellington Management Group LLP, with ownership of 12%. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 8.1%.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Baxter InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Baxter International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$64m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Baxter International. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Baxter International better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Baxter International (including 1 which is potentially serious) .Ultimately the future is most important.

Merck was evaluating islatravir as a treatment for HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretrovirals. With the FDA’s clinical hold in place, no new studies have been initiated on islatravir.Merck’s stock has risen 12.2% this year so far against a decrease of 4.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, now the new phase III studies will evaluate a once-daily oral combination of doravirine 100 mg and a lower dose of islatravir (DOR/ISL). While one study will evaluate DOR/ISL in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection, two studies will begin on DOR/ISL to evaluate it as a switch in antiretroviral therapy in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed. The FDA has reviewed and agreed to the plan.In 2021, Merck collaborated with Gilead GILD to evaluate the combination of islatravir with the latter’s lenacapavir to develop long-acting HIV treatment options. Gilead and Merck also initiated a phase II study, evaluating the combination of a once-weekly treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in people living with HIV who are virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Back in December, all dosing of participants in the abovementioned phase II study was also stopped. However, the study will now resume with a lower dose of islatravirStory continuesMeanwhile, for all the above studies, the partial clinical hold remains valid for doses higher than those considered for the revised phase III clinical program.However, Merck has decided to discontinue the development of the once-monthly oral islatravir for the prevention of HIV infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEPGSK GSK is another key player in the HIV market other than Merck and Gilead. GSK’s Apretude, a long-acting injectable form of cabotegravir drug, was approved by the FDA in December 2021 for PrEP.An oral formulation of cabotegravir, with the trade name of Vocabria, is already approved in combination with J&amp;J’s JNJ Edurant (oral rilpivirine) for the short-term treatment of HIV-1 infection. A combination of long-acting injectable cabotegravir and J&amp;J’s Edurant is approved as Cabenuva for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in virologically suppressed adults.Cabenuva has been co-developed by J&amp;J’s pharmaceutical subsidiary, Janssen and GSK’s HIV subsidiary, ViiV Healthcare.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has lost 5.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share, indicating a change of -1.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.05 points to a change of +2.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.51 indicates a change of +4.7% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $95.13 billion and $98.95 billion estimates indicate +1.5% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3%. EPS of $2.59 for the same period compares with $2.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.45%. The EPS surprise was +0.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One word stood out: “Savage.”That moment changed Losier’s life. More than a decade later, he still gets a chill up his spine remembering seeing the slur. He began learning as much as possible about his tribe, Mi’kmaq. It wasn’t long before he started taking action – first in his role as a respiratory therapist, then as a sales representative at Medtronic.So, when news of mass graves at residential schools in Canada came out in 2021, Losier was not surprised. But it was a wake-up call for many.“I believed my elders and heard the stories,” he said. “But it’s also like war; sometimes they don’t want to talk about what they saw or who they did not come back with. It’s a real-life trauma.”As a leader in an employee-led group of First Nations, Inuit, and Metis employees and allies at Medtronic Canada, the news spurred him and other employees to act. And the perfect opportunity was just around the corner.Looking back – to move forwardEvery June, the Medtronic Foundation kicks off year-round volunteerism and giving with an initiative called Project 6 – aligned to Tenet 6 of the Medtronic Mission to be a good corporate citizen.The group put together a series of six lunch and learn sessions, leveraging the University of Alberta’s Indigenous Canada course.“Learning about what happened at the residential schools is an important way for people to connect with our Canadian history — and understand the inequities First Nations face,” said Roxane Belanger, a communications specialist and member of the First Nations, Inuit, and Metis group. “We’re helping our employees gain more empathy and understand intergenerational trauma and inform how they interact with our indigenous community in healthcare settings — and in the community.”Story continuesFor Suzanne Thomson, a senior program manager in Medical Education, who has been in education at Medtronic for 15 years, the initiative combined her passion for education and social justice.""Everything starts with education, so I am very grateful that Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation recognize the value of education pertaining to volunteerism and that education is the first step towards positive change,” she said.Manon Desrochers has volunteered for Project 6 many times in her 10 years at Medtronic, from participating in food drives to bringing feminine products to a women and children’s shelter. But this year’s Project 6 initiative was different.“I have knowledge now and can be an ally for the Indigenous community,” she said.Before the six-week course was even complete, she found herself sharing her learnings with family and friends.That’s exactly what Losier hopes for other employees who came to the lunch and learn sessions. He remembers wanting to speak up while witnessing inequities in his time as a respiratory therapist.“I couldn’t teach before because I didn’t know, but now because of the knowledge I have gained, I can speak up,” he said.During this year’s Project 6 kick-off, 9,164 Medtronic employees around the world participated in volunteer events and 3,995 Medtronic employees donated to their favorite nonprofits.

In 2020, there were over 55,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in China.The approval by China’s National Medical Products Administration was based on an HRD-positive subgroup exploratory analysis of the Phase 3 PAOLA-1 trial, which showed LYNPARZA plus bevacizumab following response to platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated a substantial progression-free survival (PFS) improvement versus bevacizumab alone for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer. The safety and tolerability profile of LYNPARZA in this trial was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials, with no new safety signals. The most common adverse reactions (ARs) occurring in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA in combination with bevacizumab and at a ≥5% greater frequency compared to bevacizumab alone were nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%) and leukopenia (18%). Additional ARs that occurred in ≥10% of patients receiving LYNPARZA in combination with bevacizumab, irrespective of the frequency compared to bevacizumab alone were diarrhea (18%), neutropenia (18%), urinary tract infection (15%) and headache (14%).Story continuesDuring the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2022, updated results were presented from the PAOLA-1 trial, demonstrating that LYNPARZA plus bevacizumab provided a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) in an exploratory subgroup analysis of HRD-positive patients with advanced ovarian cancer. These OS results were not statistically significant.Professor Ding Ma, member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said, ""Ovarian cancer has the highest fatality rate among gynecologic cancers in China. The emergence of PARP inhibitors and their application in the first-line treatment of ovarian cancer could help patients delay disease progression and achieve long-term remission. In the PAOLA-1 trial, the combination of olaparib and bevacizumab demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival. This approval provides HRD-positive patients with a new option for first-line maintenance therapy.""Professor Beihua Kong, chairman of the gynecological oncology branch of the Chinese Medical Association, said, ""Ovarian cancer has entered the era of precision medicine, and HRD detection (including BRCA1/2 mutations) has important clinical value for newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer to help guide first-line treatment decisions. The approval of the combination of olaparib and bevacizumab brings a clinically meaningful survival benefit to HRD-positive patients, and further reflects the importance of a precision approach to help guide treatment decisions in ovarian cancer.""Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, oncology business unit, AstraZeneca, said, ""The maintenance treatment of LYNPARZA in combination with bevacizumab has shown to both improve progression-free survival and provide a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival in patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. I am thrilled we can now bring this targeted treatment option to these patients in China.""Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""This approval is an important milestone for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in China and underscores the critical importance of HRD testing for all women with advanced ovarian cancer at the point of diagnosis.""The primary results from the PAOLA-1 trial showed that LYNPARZA plus bevacizumab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 67% (HR=0.33 [95% CI, 0.25-0.45]). In the subgroup of patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer, the addition of LYNPARZA to bevacizumab improved PFS to a median of 37.2 versus 17.7 months with bevacizumab alone. The data from the PAOLA-1 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2019.Further results from the five-year analysis of the PAOLA-1 trial recently presented at the ESMO Congress 2022 showed LYNPARZA plus bevacizumab increased median OS to 56.5 months versus 51.6 months with bevacizumab alone in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. This increase was not statistically significant. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of HRD-positive patients, LYNPARZA plus bevacizumab provided a clinically meaningful improvement in OS, reducing the risk of death by 38% (HR=0.62 [95% CI, 0.45-0.85]) versus bevacizumab, despite PAOLA-1 having 30% stage IV patients.LYNPARZA in combination with bevacizumab is approved in the U.S., European Union and several other countries as a first-line maintenance treatment for patients with HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer and is currently under regulatory review in other countries around the world.About PAOLA-1PAOLA-1 is a Phase 3, double-blind trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of LYNPARZA added to standard-of-care bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone as a first-line maintenance treatment for patients with newly diagnosed advanced FIGO stage III-IV high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who had a complete or partial response to first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. AstraZeneca and Merck announced in August 2019 that the trial met its primary endpoint of PFS in the overall trial population.PAOLA-1 is an ENGOT (European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups) trial, sponsored by ARCAGY Research (Association de Recherche sur les CAncers dont GYnécologiques) on behalf of GINECO (Groupe d’Investigateurs National des Etudes des Cancers Ovariens et du sein). ARCAGY-GINECO is an academic group specializing in clinical and translational research in patients’ cancers and a member of the GCIG (Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.Venous Thromboembolic Events: Including pulmonary embolism, occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab and at a ≥5% frequency compared to placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%) and leukopenia (18%).

Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad and advanced clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About ovarian cancerOvarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women worldwide. Globally, there were more than 313,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2020 and over 207,000 deaths. The five-year survival rate of newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer patients has typically been 30-50%. Roughly half of women with advanced ovarian cancer have HRD-positive tumors, including those with a BRCA mutation, and one in four women have a BRCA mutation. The primary aim of first-line treatment is to delay disease progression for as long as possible with the intent to achieve long-term remission.About homologous recombination deficiencyHomologous recombination deficiency, which defines a subgroup of ovarian cancer, encompasses a wide range of genetic abnormalities, including BRCA mutations and beyond. As with BRCA gene mutations, HRD interferes with normal cell DNA repair mechanisms and confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors including LYNPARZA.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products, including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment.

Merck was evaluating islatravir as a treatment for HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretrovirals. With the FDA’s clinical hold in place, no new studies have been initiated on islatravir.Merck’s stock has risen 12.2% this year so far against a decrease of 4.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, now the new phase III studies will evaluate a once-daily oral combination of doravirine 100 mg and a lower dose of islatravir (DOR/ISL). While one study will evaluate DOR/ISL in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection, two studies will begin on DOR/ISL to evaluate it as a switch in antiretroviral therapy in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed. The FDA has reviewed and agreed to the plan.In 2021, Merck collaborated with Gilead GILD to evaluate the combination of islatravir with the latter’s lenacapavir to develop long-acting HIV treatment options. Gilead and Merck also initiated a phase II study, evaluating the combination of a once-weekly treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in people living with HIV who are virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Back in December, all dosing of participants in the abovementioned phase II study was also stopped. However, the study will now resume with a lower dose of islatravirStory continuesMeanwhile, for all the above studies, the partial clinical hold remains valid for doses higher than those considered for the revised phase III clinical program.However, Merck has decided to discontinue the development of the once-monthly oral islatravir for the prevention of HIV infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEPGSK GSK is another key player in the HIV market other than Merck and Gilead. GSK’s Apretude, a long-acting injectable form of cabotegravir drug, was approved by the FDA in December 2021 for PrEP.An oral formulation of cabotegravir, with the trade name of Vocabria, is already approved in combination with J&amp;J’s JNJ Edurant (oral rilpivirine) for the short-term treatment of HIV-1 infection. A combination of long-acting injectable cabotegravir and J&amp;J’s Edurant is approved as Cabenuva for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in virologically suppressed adults.Cabenuva has been co-developed by J&amp;J’s pharmaceutical subsidiary, Janssen and GSK’s HIV subsidiary, ViiV Healthcare.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

295,4f3f4f03-457b-3d62-abe9-5eb96f547d45,WMB,2022-09-22,"Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Shell's CEO Succession, Williams' Acquisition & More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-gas-stock-roundup-shells-121812771.html,1663762692,STORY,"['LNG', 'FTI', 'NG=F', 'CL=F', 'WMB', 'SHEL']","[It was a week when both oil and natural gas prices continued their decline.On the news front, Europe’s largest oil company Shell plc SHEL announced the departure of chief executive officer (CEO) Ben van Beurden next year, while energy infrastructure operator The Williams Companies WMB closed the buyout of natural gas storage firm NorTex Midstream. Developments associated with Cheniere Energy LNG, APA Corporation APA and TechnipFMC FTI also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was another bearish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.9% to close at $85.11 per barrel, while natural gas prices decreased 2.9% to end at $7.764 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).U.S. oil prices moved lower as the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") showed a build in stockpiles in its latest weekly release. As it is, crude remained under pressure from familiar fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.Natural gas notched a bigger weekly loss, primarily due to a bearish inventory report. Unfavorable weather forecasts and a spurt in production have also been blamed for pushing prices lower.Recap of the Week’s Most-Important Stories1. Shell has declared that the incumbent CEO of the company — Ben van Beurden — will step down from his position by the end of 2022. Wael Sawan, SHEL’s head of gas and renewables, will succeed Ben van Beurden and take charge as the CEO, starting Jan 1, 2023.Ben van Beurden, however, will continue working as an adviser to the board till Jun 30, 2023, after which he will leave the group. He has been serving as the CEO of the British energy major since January 2014. Prior to this, Ben van Beurden served as the downstream director and as the executive vice president of chemicals before that. During his tenure, Shell acquired the British multinational oil and gas company — BG Group plc — which turned out to be one of SHEL’s largest acquisitions in decades.Presently serving as the director of integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions, Wael Sawan is expected to help continue Shell’s green transition strategy, which aims at cutting down the firm’s greenhouse-gas emissions and its transformational strategy initiated by Ben van Beurden. Having previously worked as the director of upstream, Sawan has been part of the organization for more than 25 years. (Shell to Replace Current CEO With Wael Sawan in 2023)2. The Williams Companies recently announced that it has concluded the $423-million deal to acquire Houston-based NorTex Midstream, a fully contracted natural gas pipeline and storage asset, from the private equity firm Tailwater Capital’s affiliate.As part of the contract, the Tulsa, OK-based pipeline operator will take over NorTex assets. These include roughly about 80 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines along with 36 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.Per WMB, NorTex assets offer crucial service to almost 4 GW of gas-fired power generation, allowing Texas energy providers to meet peak demand effectively. The assets also enable Williams to provide storage services for the Permian gas directed toward the rising Gulf Coast LNG demand. (Williams Acquires NorTex Midstream Assets for $423M)3. Cheniere Energy, the Houston, TX-based liquefied natural gas exporter, recently announced its intention to pay higher dividends and augment share buybacks while adding to its production units.This comes at a time when Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Cheniere’s profits are up due to mounting energy prices and liquefied natural gas demand as a result of Europe trying to find alternatives to Russian gas over Moscow’s military action in Ukraine.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.LNG will hike its annual dividend by 20% to $1.58 per share from the $1.32 payout initiated last year. Moreover, the firm projects more than $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and more than $20 per share of run-rate distributable cash flow. The full-year 2022 distributable cash flow forecast was increased to the range of $8.1 billion-$8.6 billion from the earlier guidance range of $6.9-$7.4 billion. (Cheniere to Increase Repurchase, Raises Earnings Forecast)4   APA Corporation recently got approval from the board of directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 12.5 cents to 25 cents per share. The new payout will be on Nov 22 to its common shareholders of record on Oct 21. Following the 100% hike this quarter, APA’s annual dividend of $1 per share yields 2.41%, which is better than the S&amp;P 500’s 1.54%.The macro environment for U.S. Exploration &amp; Production operators like APA remains robust, thanks to high commodity prices and improved fundamentals that should aid long-term growth. This positive backdrop, together with APA’s significant debt profile improvement and healthy cash flows, allows the company to reward investors with a dividend hike.APA management sees the dividend hike as part of its commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. However, stock buyback continues to be the company’s preferred tool to distribute cash, with APA adding another 40 million shares to its buyback authorization. (APA Ups Shareholder Returns: Hikes Dividend, Expands Buyback)5   TechnipFMC declared that it was awarded a “significant” engineering, procurement, construction and installation contract by TotalEnergies for its Lapa North East field situated in the pre-salt Santos Basin offshore Brazil. Located in the pre-salt Santos Basin, the Lapa field commenced oil production in 2016 via the MODEC-supplied FPSO Cidade de Caraguatatuba MV27.Per the contract, the French-American, U.K.-domiciled oilfield services major will reconfigure and set up umbilicals and flexible pipes in a new configuration that will further secure the production of the field. Per TechnipFMC’s definition of a significant contract, the deal is worth between $75 million and $250 million.President, Subsea, at TechnipFMC, Jonathan Landes, mentioned that the Brazilian offshore market is becoming more diverse concerning the scope of work as well as customer opportunity. “On Lapa North East, we are working with a valued client with whom we have built a trusted relationship. By offering the flexibility of a phased campaign, we are helping TotalEnergies accelerate its schedule and begin production sooner,"" he added.

""So, really, for new customers that are coming in now to book slots, they have to book in late 2026 or 2027.""Lessors such as AerCap Holdings NV, BBAM and Aero Capital Solutions (ACS) have piled in, even, in some cases, booking speculative conversion slots before signing up airline customers.""As aircraft age and airlines think about asset changes, the lessor community has a more vital role or a greater stake in this base of transactions,"" said Mike Doellefeld, the vice president of Boeing Global Services' commercial programmes.AerCap declined to comment, while BBAM and ACS did not respond to requests for comment.Even though some airlines have eagerly snapped up freighters, prompted by the strong e-commerce market and the slow return of passenger flights with cargo belly capacity in some regions, analysts wonder how long that trend will last.""Particularly in the narrowbody segment, I think the effect is going to be that lease rates are going to drop,"" said Frederic Horst, managing director of Sydney-based freight consultancy Trade and Transport Group.""Lessors may be stuck with converted planes.""Lessors face greater risk than converters, which can fill their hangars with other maintenance work as passenger demand rebounds, Horst added.For its part, HAECO is trying to avoid being overexposed to P2F conversions from lessors, said Richard Kendall, its chief operating officer, who saw a drop-off in freighter demand in a couple of years.""We don't want to see the bubble burst and be caught with broken commitments that we can't then backfill,"" he added on the sidelines of the MRO Asia-Pacific conference in Singapore.(Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)]"

Wisk’s operations won’t be affected by Kittyhawk’s shutdown, Boeing said on Wednesday.Kittyhawk traces its history to 2010, when a company then known as Zee.Aero set out to pioneer the market for so-called eVTOLs -- electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft -- ultimately with the goal of democratizing the skies. The secretive company was run by Sebastian Thrun, a Google veteran who worked on self-driving cars, augmented-reality glasses and other projects.The business was one of several startups working on the concept, which has proven to be a greater challenge than some expected. Air taxis have suffered crashes during testing in recent months, raising concerns about their safety.Insider previously reported on Kittyhawk’s plans to close.Kittyhawk formed its Wisk venture with Boeing Co. in 2019, and the airplane manufacturer went on to invest $450 million in the partnership. Earlier this week, Boeing and Wisk presented their vision for a world where eVTOLs can coexist with larger commercial aircraft.“Kittyhawk’s decision to cease operations does not change Boeing’s commitment to Wisk,” a spokeswoman for the plane manufacturer said in an email. “We are proud to be a founding member of Wisk Aero and are excited to see the work they are doing to drive innovation and sustainability through the future of electric air travel.”Story continuesThe aviation titan helped showcase Wisk’s rotor-powered Cora aircraft at the Farnborough International Airshow in July. Along with financing the business, Boeing has been providing engineering resources for a larger, electric four-seater aircraft that Wisk intends to eventually certify with US regulators.The air-taxi market still has numerous competitors, including Joby Aviation Inc., Archer Aviation Inc., Germany’s Lilium NV and Brazil’s Eve, but they face uncertain prospects for these futuristic vehicles. Aviation regulators haven’t yet certified the new generation of flying machines to transport humans.Kittyhawk’s goal was to make an air taxi that could be remotely piloted, was smaller and lighter than other eVTOLs, and could take off from nearly anywhere. The company was targeting a cost of less than $1 a mile, which would have made the taxis cheaper than ride-sharing services.Now Kittyhawk’s shutdown closes a chapter for one of the highest-profile eVTOL pioneers -- and shows how hard the market is to crack. As of Wednesday, the company still had this message on its home page: “If anyone can do this, we can.”(Updates with more on Kittyhawk’s history in fourth paragraph.

Now the meeting was to review improved aircraft training plans for the jet after those two fatal crashes that led to the grounding of the 737 Max in China in 2019.Now, interestingly, Boeing also announcing today that it's teaming up with augmented reality developer Red 6 for advanced fighter pilot training. This is part of Boeing's broader strategy for modernizing pilot training, as well as its next generation of aircraft, Seana. Stock under pressure, though, and year to date, down about almost 30% there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, stock under pressure here, along with the broader markets. It's interesting here just because we know China could be critical here for Boeing just regaining its footing here. Certainly would be a huge step forward as it does try to improve its balance sheet since it had been hit so hard by the grounding of the 737. Also the fact of COVID and how big of a hit that had on Boeing here over the last two years.In terms of the job cuts, Boeing did quickly point out that it was not related to the announcement earlier this year that it was moving its headquarters.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/88-ownership-illumina-inc-nasdaq-110221200.html,1663758141,STORY,['ILMN'],"[A look at the shareholders of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 88% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Illumina, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Illumina ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Illumina?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Illumina already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Illumina, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Illumina is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Baillie Gifford &amp; Co. is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.6% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of IlluminaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Illumina, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$38m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Illumina. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Illumina better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

As the first life insurance carrier to make this breakthrough screening technology available, John Hancock is enabling eligible customers to take proactive steps to better understand and make more informed choices about their health.(PRNewsfoto/John Hancock)According to the American Cancer Society, more than 600,000 people die from cancer each year in the United States and many cancers show no symptoms until later stages, when treatment options may be limited.1 Early detection of cancer can improve cancer outcomes, yet today, many cancers are detected in late stages because only five types have recommended screenings — breast, cervical, colon, lung, and prostate cancers.John Hancock Vitality is available with the company's life insurance policies — offering education, support, incentives, and rewards to encourage customers to take everyday steps toward a longer, healthier, better life. The Galleri test, the newest feature to be added to the program for eligible customers, is a first-of-its-kind multi-cancer early detection blood test. In a clinical study, the Galleri test demonstrated the ability to detect a signal from more than 50 types of cancers, over 45 of which lack recommended screening tests. The test can also help determine where in the body cancer may be located, which can then guide diagnostic follow up.""At John Hancock, we are deeply invested in helping our customers live longer, healthier, better lives. Almost everyone has experienced the devastating effects of cancer in some way and by making this early screening technology available, we can help change the cancer narrative for some of our customers,"" said Brooks Tingle, President and CEO of John Hancock Insurance. ""As a life insurer, we can use our unique position to make a powerful impact. As such, we are bringing together carriers, distributors, reinsurers, and innovative technology companies to transform our customers' experience while empowering them with knowledge about their health, ultimately improving lives.""Story continuesIndividual test results will not be shared with John Hancock and will have no impact on a customer's current life insurance coverage or pricing, or status in the Vitality program. John Hancock has partnered with GRAIL's exclusive reinsurance partner, Munich Re Life US, to bring this offering to life insurance customers for the first time, with support from Swiss Re and SCOR. John Hancock has also collaborated with M Financial Group, an early partner of GRAIL.""This collaboration amongst forward-thinking organizations, within the insurance industry, highlights the power of strategic industry partners rallying around an aligned mission to help fight cancer,"" said Bob Ragusa, Chief Executive Officer at GRAIL. ""With this initiative by John Hancock to make Galleri available to eligible customers, as a complement to other cancer screenings, we can help change the status quo and continue in our goal to dramatically increase cancer detection from screening in the population to improve public health.""Marc Giguere, President and CEO of Munich Re Life US commented, ""Munich Re Life US has a responsibility to society to help advance early cancer detection and treatments that produce better outcomes for cancer patients. With this partnership, we are helping to bridge the gap between medical research and advancements and their impact on life insurance by bringing innovative solutions to our carrier partners. Munich Re Life US is incredibly proud to embark on this journey with GRAIL and John Hancock.""Through this pilot, John Hancock will assess customer adoption of Galleri, as well as the overall user experience, before deciding how best to offer the test in the future.

The test is manufactured and distributed by GRAIL. John Hancock is not an affiliate of GRAIL. John Hancock does not provide medical advice and is not responsible for the accuracy or performance of the Galleri test. There is no coordination between any health benefits you may receive from an insurance policy, health plan, or any other wellness programs you may be enrolled in.Galleri is not a test to confirm or rule out genetic or other conditions that may indicate a predisposition to cancer. It is important to underscore that Galleri is not a means of diagnosis, but rather a tool to help individuals screen for cancer earlier. The Galleri test does not replace recommended routine cancer screenings. The Galleri test has not been cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but has received a breakthrough device designation by the FDA. GRAIL's clinical laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). As GRAIL pursues FDA approval, they have launched Galleri as a Laboratory Developed Test in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, backed by evidence. The Galleri test is only available to registered John Hancock Vitality PLUS members who are 50 years of age or older, have completed the Vitality Health Review (VHR) for the current program year, and whose policies were issued between 9/1/2019 and 3/31/2022. For eligible policies with coverage amounts of $500,000 or greater, 100% of the cost of the test will be subsidized. For policies with less than $500,000 in coverage, 50% of the cost of the test will be subsidized.The Galleri test through The John Hancock Vitality Program is not currently available in ID, ND, NM, NY or VT.Insurance products are issued by: John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), Boston, MA 02116 (not licensed in New York) and John Hancock Life Insurance Company of New York, Valhalla, NY 10595Important Safety InformationThe Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. The Galleri test does not detect all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer screening tests recommended by a healthcare provider. Galleri is intended to detect cancer and predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. Use of Galleri is not recommended in individuals who are pregnant, 21 years old or younger, or undergoing active cancer treatment.Results should be interpreted by a healthcare provider in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of ""Cancer Signal Not Detected"" does not rule out cancer. A test result of ""Cancer Signal Detected"" requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g., imaging) to confirm cancer. If cancer is not confirmed with further testing, it could mean that cancer is not present or testing was insufficient to detect cancer, including due to the cancer being located in a different part of the body. False-positive (a cancer signal detected when cancer is not present) and false-negative (a cancer signal not detected when cancer is present) test results do occur. Rx only.

The problem is the definition of what makes a company blue chip varies. Some believe it’s consistent and increasing dividends. Others look to bottom-line profits or rock-solid balance sheets. In other words, it’s subjective. Rather than spend excessive time settling on the best criteria for determining blue-chip stocks to buy for safety,  I’ve selected seven names that appear in the holdings of one or more of the following blue-chip exchange-traded funds: Monarch Blue Chips Core ETF (BATS:MBCC), T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:TCHP) and Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (BATS:FBCG).As always, I’ll ensure that the selections provide reasonable sector diversification. In addition, the stock must have a positive annualized total return over the past one-year, three-year and five-year periods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven blue-chip stocks to buy for safety and reduced volatility.NEENextEra Energy $84.79LLYEli Lilly$308.89AAPLApple$150.70TSLATesla$303.35UNHUnitedHealth Group$521.02SOSouthern Company$77.25COSTCostco Wholesale$504.14NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is not only one of my favorite utility stocks but also one of my favorite stocks, period. It’s a traditional power company through Florida Power &amp; Light, the country’s largest electric utility with more than 5.7 million customer accounts. It’s also the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar through its NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary. NEE has delivered an annualized total return of 2.9% over a one-year period, 17.8% over a three-year period and 19.5% over a five-year period, all significantly better than the S&amp;P 500.The company reported excellent second-quarter results in late July. Operating revenue of $5.18 billion was 32% higher than a year earlier. On the bottom line, operating income of $948 million was 86% higher than a year ago. Story continuesAnalysts expect earnings per share to increase 12.6% this year to $2.87 and 7.7% next year to $3.09. Based on its current share price, NEE stock trades at 29.5x 2022 earnings and 27.4x 2023 earnings. Add in a 2% dividend yield and I’m not sure how you couldn’t like NEE stock.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is an Indianapolis-based large-cap pharmaceutical company.  Ten years ago, its three top-selling drugs by revenue were Zyprexa (for treatment of schizophrenia), Cymbalta (for the treatment of depression and anxiety) and Alimta (for the treatment of lung carcinoma). Today, the company’s top three drugs’s are Trulicity (for diabetes), Taltz (for psoriasis) and Verzenio (for breast cancer).     As we discovered during the pandemic, the drug companies — typically viewed by consumers as uncaring, overcharging money machines — turned out to be lifesavers. Hopefully, the balance between overcharging and undercharging can be found in the future by federal and state governments. In the meantime, Eli Lilly is doing just fine. In 2021, it had slightly less than $6 billion in free cash flow ($7.26 billion net cash provided by operating activities less $1.31 billion in purchases of property and equipment). That means it converted 107% of its net income into FCF. Anytime you go above 100%, you’re doing a lot right in your business. Forget the growth, or lack thereof, in recent quarters. These things go in cycles as the drug pipelines develop.Over every period, long and short, it’s delivered for shareholders with an annualized total return of 35.5% over a one-year period, 42.5% over a three-year period and 31.5% over a five-year period.Apple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comI thought about putting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy for safety over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, it’s down 19% over the past year, so it doesn’t meet my criteria. AAPL stock is up 1.9% over the past 12 months. And its three- and five-year annualized total returns are 40.1% and 31.1%, respectively.   Apple is Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) largest equity holding by a country mile for a reason. CEO Tim Cook keeps coming up with good ways to generate and grow revenue and profits. In March 2017, I said Apple was a value play: “Currently, Apple stock’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $52.5 billion or $9.72 per share; an FCF yield of 6.9% based on its March 27 closing price of $140.88. By comparison, Microsoft has free cash flow of $3.49 per share for the trailing 12 months or an FCF yield of 5.4% based on its March 27 closing price of $65.10.”Today, Apple’s and Microsoft’s FCF yields are 4.4% ($107.58 billion in TTM FCF divided by $2.42 trillion market cap)  and 3.6% ($65.15 billion TTM FCF divided by $1.83 trillion market cap), respectively. While they’ve both gotten more expensive over the past five years, Apple remains the value play of the two. However, I don’t think MSFT is a bad bet if you can afford to buy both.Apple has excellent free cash flow and a strong balance sheet and possesses structural tailwinds that should be sustainable in a slowing economy, Treasury Partners Chief Investment Officer Richard Saperstein recently told Barron’s. In short, AAPL stock is as blue-chip as they come. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comIt’s hard to believe Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considered a blue-chip company, but the numbers don’t lie. Over the past three fiscal years, the electric vehicle maker’s operating income has grown more than 8,000%, from $80 million in 2019 to $6.5 billion in 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, Tesla’s been generating operating profits since June 2019.The business has gotten so brisk that the company is considering opening a gigafactory in Ontario or Quebec to take on some of the company’s manufacturing needs for North America. According to reporting from Electrek, Canada’s Minister of Industry and Innovation Francois-Philippe Champagne is rumored to have visited Tesla’s California plant as part of the current discussions to make a Canadian plant a reality. As a Canadian, I think that’s a wise idea. Canada has an automotive history that dates back to the early 1900s.Tesla wants to produce 20 million vehicles annually in North America by 2030. A factory in Canada would certainly help make this possible. The company says it needs eight more factories to meet its goals. While there are many reasons why someone might buy Tesla stock, the fact that it’s been able to cut its cost to make each vehicle from $84,000 in 2017 to $36,000 today is a big reason why it’s become so profitable.   With annualized total returns of 20.2%, 165.6% and 64.3% over the past one-year, three-year and five-year periods, respectively, I wouldn’t bet against Tesla. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comThe second of two healthcare companies on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy for safety, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), is a leading provider of healthcare-related services through four operating units. United Healthcare provides healthcare benefit plans to millions of Americans through employer and individual plans. Optum Health provides basic healthcare services through more than 60,000 affiliated physicians. Optum Insight is the company’s tech unit that provides data analytics and consulting to the healthcare industry. Lastly, Optum RX is the company’s pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacare business. Together, the four businesses generated revenue of $80.3 billion and operating profits of $7.1 billion in Q2, up 13% and 19%, respectively, year over year. Management expects full-year 2022 adjusted EPS of $21.65 at the midpoint of its guidance. Based on its current share price, it trades at 24.1x its projected 2022 earnings, slightly higher than its five-year average.Every once in a while, the subject of universal healthcare is raised by politicians and investors get nervous that, if this were to happen, UnitedHealth would be out of business. That’s unlikely. Switzerland has universal coverage that’s required by law. Private insurers provide basic coverage with supplemental insurance available for additional services not covered by the basic plans. Analysts love UNH stock. Of the 26 covering it, 22 rate it a “buy” or “overweight,” and the average price target is $585.91, 12.5% above the current price. Shares have delivered an annualized total return of 26.5% over a one-year period, 31.8% over a three-year period and 22.4% over a five-year period. Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comSouthern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second of two utilities on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy for safety. The Atlanta-based company serves 9 million customers in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and elsewhere through seven operating subsidiaries.  The company’s second quarter was good, with operating revenue of $7.2 billion, 38.6% higher than a year earlier. Over the first six months of the year, revenue increased 24.7% to $13.9 billion. Revenue was higher due to increased fuel costs and an exceptionally warm second quarter, which led to higher electricity use for air conditioning units. Excluding one-time items, earnings for the second quarter were $1.14 billion, 28.4% higher than a year ago. In the six months ended June 30, they increased 12.6% to $2.18 billion. Southern Company added close to 12,000 residential electric customers during the second quarter and an additional 7,000 customers for gas. In Q2, 48% of the energy used to serve its customers was natural gas, followed by coal (20%), renewables (17%) and nuclear (15%).In early August, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission permitted the company to begin operating Vogtle Unit 3, the utility’s 45.7%-owned nuclear reactor in Georgia. Three other utilities own the rest of it. Unit 4 is still under construction, but it’s expected to be operating by the end of 2023. They are the only commercial reactors being built in the U.S. at the moment. Unit 1 of the Vogtle plant has been in operation since 1987. Vogtle 2 went into service in 1989. Once all four are operating, nuclear power should become a more significant piece of the Southern Company pie, surpassing coal.

The company’s membership warehouses continue to see a growing customer base of loyal shoppers. Yielding less than 1%, investors don’t buy COST stock for the dividend. However, over the past year, shares delivered a total return of 9.5%, almost 24 percentage points higher than the entire U.S. market. The three- and five-year annualized return numbers are even more impressive at 21.9% and 26.6%, respectively. Given our inflationary times, Costco’s value proposition makes it even more attractive as a long-term buy. Historically, the company has made most of its profits from its annual membership fees, passing on savings from suppliers in the form of lower prices.  In August, the company’s same-store sales increased 10.1% year over year, with retail sales of $17.55 billion in the month. Excluding gas and foreign currency exchange, its same-store sales increased 8.7%, with a substantial 11.7% increase from its Canadian locations. For the 52-week fiscal year ended Aug. 28, Costco’s revenues rose 15.9% to $222.7 billion. As far back as 2012, I’ve been a big fan of Costco. It operates one of the world’s best businesses. Part of the success is the business model. However, it ultimately comes down to the people. Costco’s talent separates it from other discount retailers. COST is a buy whenever you have money to invest in blue-chip stocks. In my opinion, it’s in a league of its own.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

310,37e61dc5-4c4b-368f-b6af-d3fc382cde09,MAA,2022-09-22,3 REITs with the Highest Upside According to Analysts,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-highest-upside-according-181857932.html,1663697937,STORY,"['BHR-PD', 'BDN', 'MAA-PI']","[When investors consider the vast universe of real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks they can purchase, it’s always difficult to make well-informed decisions. So it’s always comforting to know that professional analysts who have studied all of the matrices and news of a particular company support your choices.Analyst ratings also assist investors by pointing out which REITs have the highest potential upside from current prices. Here are three REIT stocks with the highest upside predictions from analysts in the past 30 days, including one with a tremendous upside of 236%:Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NYSE: BHR) is a Dallas-based REIT that invests in hotels and luxury resorts across the U.S. from California to Pennsylvania and in Puerto Rico.Braemar was recently upgraded by Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Woronka to $17 from $16 per share. With Braemar recently at $5.05 that represents a huge potential gain of 236%. Refinitiv/Verus also recently upgraded Braemar from Hold to Buy but with no price target given.Braemar has produced increases in revenue over the last four consecutive quarters and had higher earnings per share (EPS) in three of those four quarters. The 52-week range is $4.06 to $6.64.In 2019, Braemar paid a quarterly dividend of 16 cents but then eliminated the dividend until March 2022 when it was reinstated at a penny per share. For investors who are more interested in potential growth than income, Braemar could be a stock with a bright future.Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN) is a commercial REIT that owns, develops, leases and manages 175 properties from its hometown of Philadelphia to Austin, Texas.The 52-week range of Brandywine is $7.82 to $14.88, but like so many other REITs, its stock has seen its price slashed to a recent price of $8.09.This past week, Truist Securities analyst Michael Lewis upgraded Brandywine stock from Hold to Buy and set a first-time target price of $11. From its current price, this represents about 37% in upside pricing.Story continuesBrandywine’s quarterly dividend of 19 cents has been a stable but slow grower over the past five years and yields over 9% annually. Second-quarter 2022 funds from operations (FFO) of 34 cents was 2 cents better year-over-year. Revenue of $124.04 million was also higher than a year earlier. If the analyst is right, Brandywine could be a great REIT to own at this level.See also: This Little Known REIT Has Produced Double-Digit Annual Returns For The Past Five YearsMid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is a REIT that acquires, leases and manages apartment complexes. The Germantown, Tennessee, firm has over 102,000 units under its control, mostly in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest areas of the U.S.Even with rents booming across America, Mid-America has seen its price plummet from $229 at the start of 2022 to $164 recently. Higher interest rates, as with other REITs, are to blame for this downturn.Anthony Powell of Barclays recently maintained his overweight position on Mid-America and raised the target price to $215 from $211. In addition, Lewis of Truist Securities held his Buy position on Mid-America and upped his target price to $198 from $188. These target prices represent potential price increases of 29% and 19%, respectively. Clearly, Mid-America is well regarded by analysts going forward.However, investors are advised to use analyst ratings in addition to your own careful research because even the most successful analysts are only correct about 50% of the time.Looking for high dividend yields without the price volatility?Real estate is one of the most reliable sources of recurring passive income, but publicly-traded REITs are just one option for gaining access to this income-producing asset class.

Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure the final 51 Advanced Capabilities Mission Computers retrofit kits to meet the Navy’s mission requirements for the EA-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this contract will be executed in Bloomington, MN.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in programs related to a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification work.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Given Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, the company has been witnessing a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat.

An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. The recent clash between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunitions, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles for the U.S Navy. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.General Dynamics’ expertise and in-depth experience in building and supporting combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, have been helping it to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies.

And also, sometimes the day after Fed day is where you see a lot of fireworks. But right now, we're looking at the Dow that's up about half of a percent. You've got the NASDAQ composite that's higher and the S&amp;P 500 up about 6/10 of a percent.You've got Treasury yields, which have paused their recent rally. So this is helping equities. So you're looking at the 10-year Treasury at 3.53, down about 4 basis points. Also, the US dollar index is at multi-decade highs. So this is putting a cap on how high equities are going because remember, we have seen recently that correlation where when the dollar goes higher, you're seeing equities go lower.But today, a little bit of a different picture because you're looking at industrials, which are higher. And that's because of defense stocks. Those are higher. I'll get to that in just a second. But look at that. Industrials is the leader right now, followed by real estate, consumer staples. You've got energy that's in the green as well. The energy has seen bigger gains earlier this morning, paring back some of those gains.Getting to where we're at with defense stocks, this has to do with the headline about Russia escalating the war in Ukraine. So we are watching defense stocks going higher. And I'm just going to pull up the chart here so you can see some of these gains. Lockheed Martin up more than 2%. You've got Northrop Grumman up also 3% and also as well as General Dynamics, Raytheon. You get the idea.

The casting event demonstrated the maturity of Sentinel’s solid rocket motor design and validated manufacturing processes, advanced tooling, and facilities.The Sentinel program used digital engineering tools that helped iterate motor designs earlier and faster, prior to building hardware, thus allowing the team to produce the motors more efficiently and with less risk. The casting event is one of several on-time manufacturing firsts for the program over the past year as the program prepares for first flight from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California.“This first inert ‘pathfinder’ motor tested our processes and allowed us to draw down risk, paving the way for the team to begin production of additional test motors,” said Sarah Willoughby, vice president and program manager, Sentinel, Northrop Grumman. “We are now building stage-one and stage-two solid rocket motors that will undergo static test fire, and the data from these tests will be combined with information from ongoing structural and wind tunnel performance testing to fine tune our digitally engineered models, in line with the Air Force development schedule.”Sentinel is leveraging digital engineering, agile software, and open systems architecture to model and authenticate virtual designs, lowering risk and reducing the time it takes to field the system and new technologies.Motor casting is a complex process of pouring rocket motor propellant into motor cases. This completed motor set is undergoing further processing and inspection before participating in modal testing. For modal testing, both stages, along with a stage-three solid rocket motor, supplied by teammate Aerojet Rocketdyne, will participate in a series of tests to validate missile structural dynamics and flexibility, which is critical to designing a stable guidance system that accurately controls the missile in flight.Story continuesPrior to casting these motors, the Sentinel team achieved numerous on-time milestones for each stage including successful completion of the insulation and case wind process last fall. The insulation protects the casing of each motor from extreme temperatures caused by burning propellant, while the case wind applied composite material around the insulation to form the outer shell of the motors. This was a significant achievement that validated the insulated case design and manufacturing processes.Next came the application of the external protection material over each stage using a company-developed, highly efficient system that reduced process time by 66 percent, a major schedule-saving accomplishment. In June, Northrop Grumman produced the first stage-one and stage-two nozzle builds and igniter assemblies to install on these motors during rocket motor assembly later this year.“In addition to the missile, we’re testing the Sentinel system’s command and launch, missile integration and more. Our digital engineering approach enables us to build the system with sustainability in mind as we produce a safe, secure and flexible deterrent capability to protect our nation and allies for decades to come,” added Willoughby.Sentinel is the U.S. Air Force program to modernize the land leg of the strategic triad. Northrop Grumman is leading a nationwide team under the Sentinel engineering and manufacturing development contract. Teammates include Aerojet Rocketdyne, Bechtel, CAE, Clark, Collins Aerospace, General Dynamics, HDT, Honeywell, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Lockheed Martin, and Textron Systems, as well as hundreds of small and medium-sized companies from across the defense, engineering and construction industries.

Market participants expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) for the third consecutive time to control the widespread and stubborn inflation.After increasing the interest rates by 225 bps (in aggregate) so far this year, it was expected that the central bank will take a breather. But following the release of still red-hot inflation numbers last week, a smaller 50 bps rate increase is off the tables. Per the CME FedWatch Tool data, there is an 84% chance that the Fed will raise the interest rates by 75 bps tomorrow, up from the 69% probability a week ago.Against this backdrop, it is advisable to invest in banks as they thrive in a rising interest rate environment. Hence, we have selected – Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC, East West Bancorp, Inc. EWBC, Zions Bancorporation ZION, BOK Financial Corporation BOKF and Valley National Bancorp VLY – as these will benefit from higher interest rates.Yet, some serious near-term concerns, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain disruptions and fears of economic slowdown/recession in the coming six-nine months, have spooked the investors. Amid such a grim backdrop, bank stocks seem to be well-placed on rising interest rates and a steady increase in loan demand.Here’s How We Selected These BanksTo choose these banks, we ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify stocks with a market cap of $5 billion or more. Further, so far this year, these banks have lost 15% or less.Moreover, these banks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.These five banks also have a Value Score of B. The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score, which helps investors steer clear of 'value traps' and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Year-to-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesOur PicksSan Francisco-based Wells Fargo is one of the largest financial services companies in the United States. The company offers services across North America and globally through more than 4,500 retail bank branches and broad automated telling machines (ATMs) network.Wells Fargo continues to build on its deposit base. While the pace of deposit growth is likely to continue moderating in the near term, the considerable strength in its consumer business and commercial banking segments will likely support the deposit balance in the upcoming period. WFC is focused on lowering its expense base by streamlining organizational structure, consolidating branches and reducing headcount by optimizing operations and other back-office teams. Realized and identified potential gross savings through these efforts are expected to be in excess of $10 billion.Wells Fargo, with a market cap of $166.7 billion, has lost 7.7% in the year-to-date period. While the company’s earnings are expected to decline 19.2% for 2022, the same is projected to rebound and grow 28.5% for 2023.East West Bancorp serves as a financial bridge between the United States and China by providing various consumer and commercial banking services to the Asian-American community. Based in Pasadena, CA, EWBC operates through more than 120 locations in the United States and China.East West Bancorp is focused on its organic growth strategy. Continued rise in demand for loans, rising interest rates and an improving economy are expected to keep supporting net interest income in the upcoming quarters. Further, a strong balance sheet position and investment-grade credit ratings are likely to keep supporting the company’s financials.Shares of EWBC, which has a market cap of $10.2 billion, has lost 5.7% so far this year. For 2022, the company’s earnings are projected to witness year-over-year growth of 27.7%. For 2023, earnings are expected to rise 15%.Based in Salt Lake City, UT, Zions is a diversified financial service provider. The company operates through a network of more than 400 branches across 11 western states, namely Utah, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon and Wyoming.Robust loans and deposit balance, and higher interest rates should keep aiding revenues. In the rising interest rate environment, Zions’ net interest margin is likely to witness decent improvement. Business simplifying initiatives and a robust balance sheet position are the other positives. Further, given the earnings strength, Zions is likely to continue meeting debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens.In the year-to-date period, ZION has lost 7.6%. While the company’s earnings are expected to decline 12.2% for 2022, the same is projected to rebound and grow 17.9% for 2023. The company has a market cap of $9.7 billion.BOK Financial, headquartered in Tulsa, OK, is a regional financial services company. The company provides commercial banking, consumer banking and wealth management services.Amid a competitive banking environment, when most banks have been facing challenges in achieving decent loan growth, BOK Financial was able to post continuous loan growth on a diverse business model and increase in loans to individuals. Given the strong loan pipelines, higher rates and decent economic growth, it will be well-poised for organic growth. Improving asset quality, sound liquidity and inorganic expansion efforts boost the company’s growth prospects.While BOKF’s earnings are expected to fall 21.6% for 2022, the same is projected to rebound and grow 11.4% for 2023. Shares of the company, which has a market cap of $6.2 billion, have lost 11.4% so far this year.Based in Wayne, NJ, Valley National is the holding company for Valley National Bank, which offers various commercial, retail, insurance and wealth management financial services products. For more than 30 years, VLY has been engaged in strategic acquisitions that substantially supported its financials.Valley National’s organic growth trajectory, higher rates and digitization efforts will aid financials. Supported by a solid balance sheet, the company will keep expanding inorganically as well. These deals, along with several past acquisitions, are expected to be earnings accretive and help it diversify revenues and footprint. VLY remains focused on evaluating its branch network, which along with a strong balance sheet and manageable debt level, is a major tailwind.For 2022, VLY’s earnings are projected to witness year-over-year growth of 12.1%. For 2023, earnings are expected to rise 13.5%. The company has a market cap of $6 billion. Its shares have declined 12.8% in the year-to-date period.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova is here with the latest on what seemed to be a rather contentious day, as we usually expect with the bank CEOs on Capitol Hill.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Dave. Well, these testimonies got lost in the chaos of today's Fed decision and Putin's warning, of course. But there were some incredibly interesting exchanges between congressional leaders and these CEOs. The questioning was on a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, racial inequities, particularly in their lending practices, overdraft fees, and many other items.And while these hearings hardly ever result in any kind of legislative action, it is incredibly consequential for these CEOs to be put on the spot and grilled by congressional members. Some of the takeaways were remarks from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Again, he was talking about the Federal Reserve possibly still achieving a soft landing, but warning lawmakers that they should be prepared for the worst. Somewhat of a similar warning from Citibank's Jane Fraser. She said that we're going to be in for tough times ahead.And notable also was a very heated exchange between California Congressman Brad Sherman and Jamie Dimon. And Sherman questioned Dimon and Fraser about whether they still have any stakes in Russian oil companies, to which they appeared to respond with some hesitation. And things didn't go well for Dimon when he tried to add on to the conversation. Let's take a listen.- Let me go on to Citigroup. Have you cut your ties with Lukoil and Vitol?JAMIE DIMON: He said one other thing. I don't think--- Not on my time, you can.JAMIE DIMON: No one is doing--- Reclaiming my time, Mr. Dimon.- The time belongs to the gentleman from California.Story continues- You can do a press conference afterwards and comment as you like, not on my time.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Quite contentious there. There was also a lot of discussion on the geopolitical front. Jamie Dimon said that the biggest threat to US financial stability are China and Ukraine, speaking in terms of the escalating economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, but also talking about the possibility of China taking military action against Taiwan. The bank execs were asked if they would pull investments in China if that happened, and they said that they would follow government guidelines on that.And also separately, there were discussions about competing with Chinese banks. And Jamie Dimon said that it's very important that America maintains financial supremacy. And again, these discussions are still underway. We have a second day of hearings tomorrow with a lot to be addressed.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and it was an interesting dichotomy. It's more evidence that it used to be along party lines. Democrats would hammer away at the bank CEOs, and Republicans were largely supportive. That was not the case today. We've seen that pivot, and in particular, with ENG and things-- ESG, excuse me. That narrative is definitely changing with the GOP. Alexandra Semenova, great stuff. I can't believe somebody talked to Jamie Dimon that way, but it is entertaining. Rachelle.]"

It's funny that's happening in the same day as FOMC day. On deck for today, discussions on the economy, consumer protection, fossil fuels, firearms, and more. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova is watching closely. I don't think it usually happens on the same day.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, I mean, today's hearing certainly fell into the shadow a bit with all eyes on the Fed. But this is still a big event, with the leaders of some of the biggest banks in the US set to be grilled by congressional leaders. Now, typically, the purpose of these testimonies is to discuss topics like consumer protection, compliance, racial inequality, and those things will certainly be addressed. But given the macroeconomic backdrop, it is inevitable that we'll be getting a lot of remarks on the economy and on inflation.Now, the hearings are getting underway right now, but the testimonies are pre-written. And I read through some of them. Based on those notes, Jamie Dimon is slated to discuss conflicting trends in the economy and make his usual storm warning. He's going to talk about the irony of strong consumer spending and a robust labor market against the backdrop of historic inflation, quantitative tightening, and the war in Ukraine. And, you know, he's going to mention strong consumer balance sheets and how these are headwinds, while the economy is also facing many tailwinds.Citibank CEO Jane Fraser will also echo that tune on the economy. She's going to call today's conditions ""no less daunting than the start of the pandemic."" And then also on the regulatory front, Dimon will complain about higher capital requirements for banks. That is the amount, of course, of liquid capital that financial institutions are required to hold to ensure that they don't have too many investments and risk default. And Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf is set to ask Congress for patience as Wells Fargo works to meet their regulatory expectations.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Now, on the topic of bank compliance, Morgan Stanley, they had a bit of a snafu protecting its customers. What happened there?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, a bit interesting the timing of this. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman will actually not be at the hearings today. But yesterday, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $35 million fine to the SEC after the bank allegedly failed to keep personal information from millions of customers safe. According to the SEC, Morgan Stanley improperly disposed of devices containing sensitive information and repeatedly hired moving and storage companies that did not know how to properly dispose of this information. And they just paid the fine. They did not resist it.BRAD SMITH: Wow. Yahoo Finance's own Alexandra Semenova, thanks for tracking, of course, the hearings taking place, as well as--ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, we'll be listening to those all day.BRAD SMITH: --the latest in the sector. Definitely. Appreciate it.]"

334,c52dbb4d-5de6-356c-9f97-df1b227eff1b,WFC,2022-09-22,Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 73% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-nyse-wfc-110103740.html,1663758063,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Wells Fargo, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Wells Fargo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wells Fargo. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.5% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$121m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

""This agreement with Global Fund is a critical step that will boost equitable access for high-risk patients in low-and-middle-income countries.""Story continuesThe Global Fund agreement, along with an agreement signed with UNICEF for the supply of up to four million treatment courses for low- and middle-income countries earlier this year, is part of Pfizer’s comprehensive global strategy for equitable supply and access of PAXLOVID. This includes a voluntary licensing agreement with Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to enable the development and distribution of generic versions of Pfizer’s oral treatment to further expand long-term global supply and access. MPP has signed sublicense agreements with 38 manufacturers, who will supply the generic versions in 95 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Courses produced by these manufacturers are expected to be available as early as the fourth quarter of 2022.Pfizer will also provide product donation and funding to the COVID Treatment Quick Start Consortium to support efforts to accelerate COVID-19 testing and improve access to treatments in under-resourced parts of the world.Pfizer also looks to increase supply of PAXLOVID through An Accord for a Healthier World, a first-of-its-kind initiative to enable sustained, equitable access to high-quality medicines and vaccines for 1.2 billion people living in lower-income countries launched in May 2022. Through the Accord, Pfizer has committed to provide its patent-protected medicines and vaccines available in the U.S. or European Union, including PAXLOVID, on a not-for-profit basis to 45 lower-income countries and will collaborate with government and global health leaders to address barriers that limit access beyond supply, like diagnosis, education, infrastructure, storage and more.About PAXLOVID™ (nirmatrelvir [PF-07321332] tablets and ritonavir tablets)PAXLOVID is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor (also known as SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitor) therapy. It was developed to be administered orally so that it can be prescribed early after infection, potentially helping patients avoid severe illness (which can lead to hospitalization and death). Nirmatrelvir [PF-07321332], which originated in Pfizer laboratories, is designed to block the activity of the Mpro, an enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate. Co-administration with a low dose of ritonavir helps slow the metabolism, or breakdown, of nirmatrelvir in order for it to remain active in the body for longer periods of time at higher concentrations to help combat the virus.Nirmatrelvir is designed to inhibit viral replication at a stage known as proteolysis, which occurs before viral RNA replication. In preclinical studies, nirmatrelvir did not demonstrate evidence of mutagenic DNA interactions.Current variants of concern can be resistant to treatments that work by binding to the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. PAXLOVID, however, works intracellularly by binding to the highly conserved Mpro (3CL protease) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inhibit viral replication. Nirmatrelvir has shown consistent in vitro antiviral activity against the following variants: Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2.PAXLOVID is generally administered at a dose of 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice-daily for five days. One carton contains five blister packs of PAXLOVID, as co-packaged nirmatrelvir tablets with ritonavir tablets, providing all required doses for a full five-day treatment course.U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization StatementPAXLOVID has not been approved but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an EUA, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high-risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.The emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.AUTHORIZED USEThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the emergency use of the unapproved product PAXLOVID for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.LIMITATIONS OF AUTHORIZED USEPAXLOVID is not authorized for initiation of treatment in patients requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19PAXLOVID is not authorized for use as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19PAXLOVID is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive daysPAXLOVID may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which PAXLOVID belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).PAXLOVID is not approved for any use, including for use for the treatment of COVID-19.PAXLOVID is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of PAXLOVID under 564(b)(1) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONPAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (eg, toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN] or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:Alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosinAnalgesics: pethidine, propoxypheneAntianginal: ranolazineAntiarrhythmic: amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidineAnti-gout: colchicineAntipsychotics: lurasidone, pimozide, clozapineBenign prostatic hyperplasia agents: silodosinCardiovascular agents: eplerenone, ivabradineErgot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovineHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatinImmunosuppressants: voclosporinMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor: lomitapideMigraine medications: eletriptan, ubrogepantMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: finerenoneOpioid antagonists: naloxegolPDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertensionSedative/hypnotics: triazolam, oral midazolamSerotonin receptor 1A agonist/serotonin receptor 2A antagonist: flibanserinVasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptanPAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:Anticancer drugs: apalutamideAnticonvulsant: carbamazepine, primidone, phenytoinCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators: lumacaftor/ivacaftorHerbal Products: St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum)There are limited clinical data available for PAXLOVID. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with PAXLOVID use.Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Initiation of PAXLOVID, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID, respectively. These interactions may lead to:Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicationsClinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of PAXLOVIDLoss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistanceConsult Table 1 of the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 1 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy; review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications.Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID including urticaria, angioedema, dyspnea, mild skin eruptions, and pruritus. Cases of anaphylaxis, TEN, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported with components of PAXLOVID (refer to NORVIR labeling). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.Because nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.Adverse events in the PAXLOVID group (≥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency (≥5 subject difference) than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (6% and &lt;1%, respectively), diarrhea (3% and 2%), hypertension (1% and &lt;1%), and myalgia (1% and &lt;1%). The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2% in the PAXLOVID group and 4% in the placebo group.The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of PAXLOVID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactionsGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nauseaGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: MalaiseRequired Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors: The prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to PAXLOVID within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.Submit adverse event and medication error reports to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:Online: https://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 and returning by mail/faxCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting formIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: http://www.pfizersafetyreporting.com/ or by fax (1-866-635-8337) or phone (1-800-438-1985).PAXLOVID is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring.Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect.Pregnancy: There are no available human data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug‑associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. Published studies with ritonavir are insufficient to identify a drug‑associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A transient decrease in body weight was observed in the nursing offspring of rats administered nirmatrelvir. Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID‑19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID‑19.Contraception: Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception.Pediatrics: PAXLOVID is not authorized for use in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. The safety and effectiveness of PAXLOVID have not been established in pediatric patients. The authorized adult dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults, and adults with similar body weight were included in the trial EPIC-HR.Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients with increase in the severity of renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min), reduce the dose of PAXLOVID to 150 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions. PAXLOVID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min based on CKD-EPI formula) until more data are available; the appropriate dosage for patients with severe renal impairment has not been determined.No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is needed for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pfizer's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:34% = US$30b ÷ US$87b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.34.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Pfizer's Earnings Growth And 34% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Pfizer has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 6.1% net income growth seen by Pfizer over the past five years. growthStory continuesAs a next step, we compared Pfizer's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 8.6% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Pfizer's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Pfizer Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 73% (or a retention ratio of 27%) for Pfizer suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Pfizer has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 42% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that Pfizer's future ROE will drop to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Pfizer certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings growth is decent, and the high ROE does contribute to that growth. However, investors could have benefitted even more from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

""As Braintree is likely to continue driving PYPL as a whole, its unit economics may drag on PYPL's consolidated results.

""We believe WDC's fiscal first-quarter revenue and EPS are tracking below the low end of guidance, and fiscal second-quarter outlook are also likely to be meaningfully below current Street estimates,"" Ho says.

The automaker late Monday said it expects Q3 earnings before interest and taxes to arrive between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, about half of analysts' consensus estimate. This is due to ""continued supply-chain issues, with 40,000 to 45,000 'vehicles on wheels' remaining in inventory as they are waiting on parts,"" says Michael Reinking, senior market strategist at the New York Stock Exchange.

But Eonpass’ leadership is well aware of the problems that have previously bedeviled the sector known as enterprise blockchain.Eonpass has an advantage. In March, it won a competition run by the European Union’s intellectual property office, EUIPO. Alongside partners including consulting firm EY and freight forwarder Jet Air Service, Eonpass had the best model for using blockchain technology to detect fraudulent goods arriving at the border, according to EUIPO, a branch of the EU’s administration responsible for trademarks and similar issues.That has put a spring in the step of Eonpass’ founder, Thomas Rossi.“As a startup I have to be optimistic,” Rossi told CoinDesk in an online interview. “I took a lot of time to study why previous enterprise blockchains – I don't want to say they failed, but they didn't scale.”EUIPO’s interest is clear: Counterfeiting costs.A 2019 study by consultants at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the global price tag of fake pharmaceuticals at between $75 billion and $200 billion, with phony electronic parts costing a further $100 billion. EUIPO itself says 6.8% of the EU’s imports from the rest of the world are fake, corresponding to around $134 billion per year. Plus there’s the nonfinancial cost of having unsafe drugs or children's toys on the market.Fighting this isn’t easy. Customs officers the world over have a stark choice of whether to trust easily forged paperwork or force individual pallets open to check. Banks stake significant volumes of trade finance on the outcome.Story continuesOpaqueTrade in conventional goods – like prescription drugs or electronics – “is a very opaque industry and there is no way to link one shipment to the originating brand owner that approves the content of the shipment and this destination,” Rossi said.More innovative assets like non-fungible tokens, blockchain-powered assets which are supposedly used to prove an item’s ownership and authenticity, can still be faked: he cites the appearance of knock-off Hermès NFTs on OpenSea, and compares NFT platforms to a Wild West free of intellectual property rights.Rossi – like BCG – believes blockchain can help, providing customs officers with an unfakeable attestation. While IBM’s product runs on the company’s own blockchain, based on the open-source Hyperledger, Rossi’s will be adaptable enough to work with brands who might already have opted to use Ethereum rather than an alternative blockchain such as Polygon, he said.“The most important function of blockchains is that they create a shared clock,” Rossi said. “So you cannot cheat on the chronological order of events.”Existing blockchain products – he cites TradeLens, an initiative of computer giant IBM and shipping company Maersk – might have worked well for a small handful of well-resourced big businesses, but not for what he calls the “long tail” of numerous, smaller subcontractors.IBM’s initiative is “not really open source, so there is no way to spin up a node and connect to a network,” Rossi said. “Maybe inside their closed system, everything works fine … but leaving the system or letting someone else from another system come in – that part is extremely difficult.”Contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for IBM said that TradeLens is “built on open standards” and “enables supply chain participants to securely and transparently share data with one another.”Following the publication of this article, IBM further clarified that TradeLens has more than a thousand participating organizations which include small logistics firms and trucking companies. The initiative has thus far covered 65 million containers and 4.7 billion shipping events, such as a clearing of customers or transfer between carriers, which IBM says is ""not a small number."" The platform can also accept data from ocean carriers whether or not they are members, and it can run in multiple environments beyond IBM Cloud.Read more: IBM and Maersk Struggle to Sign Partners to Shipping BlockchainClosed, proprietary systems have their advantages, notably allowing a tighter grip on revenues to recoup investment. Yet, grabbing even a sliver of the $10 trillion spent on global trade would be worthwhile. Rossi has a plan for that, too.Early on, Rossi reckons he can make money by consulting for big business clients; later, by offering efficient data services for trade financers. He wants to move up from the three companies already testing to 10 by the end of next year, and 100 within a couple of years.“I've already spoken with a couple of banks here in Italy. They're really looking forward to having some more efficient way to handle the decisions that they make about the financing of value shipments,” he said. “The monetization comes after the network is as large as possible.”Unlikely evangelistSupport from the EUIPO is helpful, Rossi says, not least for making potential luxury brand clients sit up and take notice. And the EU agency remains an evangelist for a system it thinks could help overworked border guards.“Given the limited resources of enforcement officers, technologies such as blockchain could prove to be game-changing tools in the fight against trade in counterfeit products,” a spokesperson for the EUIPO told CoinDesk in a written interview. “Globally stakeholders are using various systems, which when operating are often disjointed, and this isolation is used by criminal networks to their advantage.”Results of the proof of concept for Eonpass’ model will be presented early next year, with a basic product publicly available by the end of 2023, EUIPO says. The EU agency itself is creating a database to match brands to public keys, so customs agents can check declarations signed on the blockchain are valid. It’s also working with U.S. counterparts, and presented a paper to the World Intellectual Property Organization earlier in September.The vision is an infrastructure “where any interested party (producers, consumers, transport services, etc.) can easily check the authenticity of a product and alert right-holders when an infringing product is detected,” said a leaked version of the paper, whose authenticity EUIPO has since confirmed.All will be watching to see if, with EU backing, business-focused blockchain ideas can actually thrive in the wild.Read more: Money Reimagined: Enterprise Blockchain Isn't DeadUpdate (Sept. 22, 2022, 14:03 UTC): adds additional comments from IBM detailing TradeLens and the status of IBM Cloud and IBM Blockchain.]"

SIP solution has helped to improve the development of pharmaceutical drug discovery faster even amidst severe supply chain issues globally and voluntary attrition rates rising in the labor market.Cognizant established SIP in 2016 with TransCelerate, a group formed of the world's largest biopharmaceutical organizations, to standardize clinical trial documents into a single shared environment.Standardization of clinical trials as a digital document to be shared easily reduced operational costs and increased production efficiency. As a result, SIP attracted new users and is currently used by seven of the largest global biopharmaceutical companies operating at more than 32,000 trial-ready sites. SIP utilization by clients has increased more than 65% in the last two years.The adoption of digital solutions has been slower in the healthcare industry. However, the recent growth of Cognizant’s SIP solution reflects how healthcare clients globally are transitioning to digital operating models to increase operating efficiency. Cognizant is well-poised to benefit from such new trends in the market amid the fourth industrial revolution.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and ConsensusCognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and ConsensusCognizant Technology Solutions Corporation price-consensus-chart | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteCognizant Top Line Benefits From Digital Solutions AdoptionCognizant is experiencing significant growth in its digital business operations, which is outgrowing the BPO market, thus reflecting momentum in AI, AR, automation, blockchain, IoT, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions.Story continuesAdoption of digital solutions in the healthcare sector is significantly contributing to digital business revenue growth, as reflected in the second-quarter 2022 results. Healthcare revenues (28.7% of revenues) increased 7.6% year over year at cc to $1.41 billion. The growth was driven by higher demand for its digital services among pharmaceutical clients.To benefit from the growing adoption of digital solutions in the healthcare industry, Cognizant has been building strategic partnerships with companies like Microsoft MSFT to capitalize on the opportunity for an intersection between health and cloud services.Cognizant has collaborated with Microsoft to leverage their Cloud for Healthcare solution and built a new solution to aid in remote patient monitoring for improved medical care.However, Cognizant shares have been negatively impacted by the current macroeconomic situation and geopolitical tensions. Various factors like global inflation, interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine war have negatively impacted its outlook.Cognizant shares have fallen 30.2% year to date compared with the Zacks Business-Software Servicesindustry’s decline of 36.1%.Cognizant is also facing a significant threat in the AI industry and the cloud space from companies like International Business Machines IBM and Accenture ACN.IBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, which will drive its top-line growth. IBM recently expanded its collaboration with the U.S. federal government to address current problems like cybersecurity and supply chain sustainability via its data fabric solutions and IBM Watson.Accenture is improving its market share in the industry with its recent acquisition of digital engineering and operational technology from Trancom ITS. This, in turn, will help Accenture provide customers with cloud-based logistics systems and merge warehouse operations with IoT and sensor technology.Amid tough competition and rising volatility in the tech industry, Cognizant which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is looking to address changing dynamics in the healthcare industry to counter competitors in the AI space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pandemics and wars can no longer be addressed as black swan events as these occur every few decades. Their impacts on people and society need to be considered a common incidence, and this changes operational dynamics in the healthcare industry.Biopharmaceutical companies need to reduce processing time and shift operations to the cloud supported by AI and automation to reduce manual efforts and produce life-saving drugs faster.Cognizant’s recent investments in developing its digital business model will help the company address the changing dynamics and contribute to top-line growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

360,0adc1396-d237-33e4-b6fc-faa01f1eabea,IBM,2022-09-22,Here is What to Know Beyond Why International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-international-business-130001806.html,1663765201,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -6.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 10.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -25.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.4%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.09 indicates a change of +7.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -22%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.9 billion and $61.2 billion estimates indicate -15.4% and +2.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.1%. EPS of $2.31 for the same period compares with $2.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CIVI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Stocks with Solid Fundamentals Amid Market MayhemWall Street has witnessed a tough 2022 after an astonishing rally in the last two pandemic-ridden years. The economic pain of coronavirus has been felt for the first time this year as the U.S. government has stopped its fiscal stimulus and the Fed has turned ultra-hawkish from ultra-dovish in its monetary policies.Mounting Inflation and Rigorous Rate HikeInflation remains at a 40-year high despite an increase in the Fed Fund rate from almost zero to 2.5% from March to July. A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting a decline in inflation in August due to a significant drop in energy prices and travel costs. However, food, shelter (housing and home building), vehicles and medical services drove costs higher in August.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and various other top Fed officials with voting rights have indicated that the rigorous rate hike will continue until inflation is at least down close to the Fed’s 2% target rate.After August’s CPI data, market participants are expecting another 75 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate in the September FOMC of the Fed is a foregone conclusion. Some investment analysts are also expecting a 1% rate hike this month. Powell will deliver the post-FOMC lecture today.As a result, market participants are highly concerned about a recession in the U.S. economy in the near future. Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted that he cannot give any guarantee for a soft landing of the economy under a higher interest rate regime.Story continuesStock Selection ProcessYear to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plummeted 15.5%, 19.1% and 27%, respectively.

The economic pain of coronavirus has been felt for the first time this year as the U.S. government has stopped its fiscal stimulus and the Fed has turned ultra-hawkish from ultra-dovish in its monetary policies.Mounting Inflation and Rigorous Rate HikeInflation remains at a 40-year high despite an increase in the Fed Fund rate from almost zero to 2.5% from March to July. A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting a decline in inflation in August due to a significant drop in energy prices and travel costs. However, food, shelter (housing and home building), vehicles and medical services drove costs higher in August.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and various other top Fed officials with voting rights have indicated that the rigorous rate hike will continue until inflation is at least down close to the Fed’s 2% target rate.After August’s CPI data, market participants are expecting another 75 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate in the September FOMC of the Fed is a foregone conclusion. Some investment analysts are also expecting a 1% rate hike this month. Powell will deliver the post-FOMC lecture today.As a result, market participants are highly concerned about a recession in the U.S. economy in the near future. Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted that he cannot give any guarantee for a soft landing of the economy under a higher interest rate regime.Stock Selection ProcessYear to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plummeted 15.5%, 19.1% and 27%, respectively.

(MPC) is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last 30 days.Unum Group’s UNM conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability.

Awards of about 218 million barrels for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 have tamed market worries and cut energy prices.But they have slashed the reserve to 427.2 million barrels - or about four weeks of demand - the lowest level in about 38 years. This has sparked criticism because some oil was resold to buyers overseas. A few distributions came under congressional mandates while others are pending.The two biggest receivers acquired nearly 98 million barrels so far. Valero, the second largest U.S. refiner by capacity, secured 52.7 million, while top oil processor Marathon Petroleum snapped up 45.2 million barrels.Other big buyers included Exxon Mobil, with 24.7 million barrels, Motiva Enterprises at 22.1 million, Shell at 15.2 million and Phillips 66 at 16 million.Marathon Petroleum declined to comment on crude sourcing. Other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comments.(Graphic: Valero, Marathon Petroleum secure most crude from U.S. emergency stash, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-OIL/SPR/zdpxombwgvx/chart.png)Some of the barrels were exported by Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66, TotalEnergies' trading unit Atlantic Trading and Marketing as well as Unipec, an arm of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec, according to U.S. Customs data.Most of the oil was sold via auctions at prices determined by a five-day average around the date of delivery. A smaller quantity was exchanged and typically requires receivers to replace the oil with a slightly larger volume.Story continuesAbout 24.42 million barrels were released by exchange, with the largest amounts taken by Exxon and Shell.The SPR will be replenished via contracts to purchase oil in the future at fixed, preset prices. The plan would help boost oil production, the administration said.For a full list of companies awarded SPR crude oil, please see(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

The FPSO is being developed at the COSCO shipyard in Qidong, China. The tropical storm moved through the shipyard.Typhoon Muifa was the strongest typhoon in the Yangtze River Delta in the past 10 years. It is the second-highest in China’s tropical cyclone classification system, with the maximum wind speed near its center reaching 42 meters per second.The FPSO’s mooring systems were affected by the typhoon. This resulted in the vessel drifting 200 meters off the quayside. Attempts are being made to return the vessel to the quayside. No injuries have been reported during the incident.The costs of returning the FPSO to the quayside, along with any possible damage, are likely to be covered by insurance. It is uncertain whether the incident will impact the vessel’s sail away date, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. The project is designed to achieve the first gas in the third quarter of 2023 and the first LNG at 2023-end.The project is expected to produce up to 10 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year. It will produce gas from an ultra-deepwater subsea system and mid-water FPSO vessel, which will process the gas by removing heavier hydrocarbon components. After that, the gas will be transferred to a floating liquefied natural gas facility at a nearshore hub on the Mauritania and Senegal maritime border.Price PerformanceShares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past three months.

372,3369cd07-2538-3904-868e-c9044eb7a558,AES,2022-09-22,This is Why  AES (AES) is a Great Dividend Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-aes-aes-great-dividend-154503898.html,1663775103,STORY,['AESC'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.AES in FocusHeadquartered in Arlington, AES (AES) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 6.54% so far this year. The power company is paying out a dividend of $0.16 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.44% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.13% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.74%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.63 is up 4.7% from last year. Over the last 5 years, AES has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.47%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. AES's current payout ratio is 42%, meaning it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AES expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $1.61 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.92%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AES is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A fourth planned battery cell plant will bring GM's projected total U.S. battery capacity to 160 GWh. GM now has binding agreements securing all its battery raw material to reach annual planned capacity in 2025, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and full cathode active material supply. As the company moves forward, it will work to increasingly localize its battery materials supply chain to North America.In 2023, Lithion will launch its first commercial recycling operations, drawing on data from its highly successful industrial-scale demonstration plant commissioned in January 2020. The opening of this facility, with a capacity of 7,500 metric tons per year of lithium-ion batteries, will be followed in 2025 by the launch of Lithion's first hydrometallurgical plant. Lithion has multiple facilities in the pipeline for the U.S., Europe and Korea, in line with its vision to support rapid deployment and enhanced battery end-of-life management globally.About Lithion Recycling Inc.Lithion has developed an efficient and cost-effective process to recover strategic materials from end-of-life and industrial waste of lithium-ion batteries.

GM will donate 1 million to raise about-- raise awareness about communities vulnerable to climate change. The move comes as GM races ahead to go all electric by 2035.Joining us now is Kristin Siemen. She's chief sustainability officer at GM here in town for UN Climate Week. And it's good to have you in studio. That partnership and the issue of climate equity is such an important part of addressing all this because even if we're talking about EVs right now, it is about affordability and accessibility. How does this new partnership allow you to expand beyond the pool of drivers and the pool of those who are addressing climate change right now?KRISTIN SIEMEN: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. So thanks for having me here today. And this partnership aligns very well with our work around equitable climate action, where we're very focused on making sure that this transition to all-electric is all-inclusive. And it's very important, as you mentioned, to have affordable products across every price point and segment. And this partnership allows us to really work with the young and the youth, particularly in the case of 12 areas in HBCUs to really drive education and drive awareness and support to communities that maybe traditionally have been left behind.AKIKO FUJITA: Talk to us a little bit about some of the challenges of reaching climate initiatives by certain targets. I mean, you still need fossil in order to mine materials for EVs. How does this all play out when you're talking about these green initiatives?KRISTIN SIEMEN: Yeah, so GM's made some very ambitious goals where we're really proud of their commitment around being carbon neutral in our products and operations by 2040, our plan to eliminate tailpipe emissions from light duty vehicles by 2035, and really working along that, we've made great progress towards those very ambitious goals. You mentioned the supply chain, and we have all of the materials for our batteries secured for our commitment for 2025 to have a million EV capacity here in North America, as well as in China. So really working very closely with our supply chain on sustainable materials and having that in place is really important.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: You mentioned that target of being carbon neutral by 2040 with every company. Scope 1 and 2, which is your direct emissions, is always the easy part, right? Scope 3, which is your supply chain, a much bigger challenge. How closely are you working with those partners right now? And how big of a load is that when you consider the investment that's needed to help some of those partners come along for this ride?KRISTIN SIEMEN: Yeah, so as you mentioned, scope 1 and 2 is the traditional work for GM. That's less than 2% of our overall carbon footprint. About 84% of our carbon footprint is the customer usage of our vehicles. So that transition to an all-electric future in the portfolio is so important. The next chunk is the supply chain. And we're working really closely with our suppliers.In fact, last year, we issued what we call an ESG pledge with our suppliers. And that's around working with them to make their own commitments around carbon neutral goals, as well as them working on the human rights aspects and the sustainability of their supply chain. And we've made-- we have great suppliers. We have great relationships. And that pledge is just moving that commitment even closer.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, on the supplier issue, the president obviously signed in the Inflation Reduction Act. A lot of carmakers were vocally opposed to the requirements that are needed to get those EV tax credits in place because a majority of it would have to be supplied from North America. When you look at what the supply chain looks like for GM, in your estimation, how long would it take for GM to be able-- GM cars to be able to qualify for that?KRISTIN SIEMEN: Yeah, I mean, the Inflation Recovery Act has a lot of great points in it. And although it's going to be challenging to make it happen overnight, we're really excited with the support that it provides for our all-electric future. As far as the manufacturing here in the United States, I mean, GM's announced four battery cell manufacturing plants. In fact, our facility in Ohio has already started production. And so we're really excited to see the resiliency and the sustainability of really having that and making the country a leader and strong.AKIKO FUJITA: But as it stands now, the cars would not qualify because of where the cars are sourced from?KRISTIN SIEMEN: No, I mean, we're doing our manufacturing here in the US as well. We've got a number of plants that have already converted. So we're well on our way to meeting those plans.INES FERRE: And what about on the demand side and getting consumers on board to adopt, for example, electric vehicles? I know that GM just announced a deal with Hertz to provide Hertz with 175,000 EVs. There still needs to be, though, an infrastructure that's set up for charging electric vehicles. The price point needs to come down. Where is the industry on that?KRISTIN SIEMEN: Yeah, I mean, so, again, from a General Motors perspective, we're committed to have products across every price point and segment. We have today the very affordable Bolt EV and SUV that are under $30,000. We just introduced last week or revealed the Chevrolet Equinox, which, again, is a $30,000 family-sized SUV in the largest segment of vehicles available. So that price point and affordability is extremely important.And really getting everybody access-- we talk about infrastructure, and it's one of those you can't wait. When the automobile first came on board, there wasn't a gas station on every corner. So although we can't make this transition alone, GM is really committed to provide support and be part of the solution for the infrastructure as well.We announced a commitment or a collaboration we have with Pilot and Flying J, which is installing DC fast chargers across the US and really showing that everyone can live in an EV world. And from an equitable standpoint, we're looking, too, to make sure that infrastructure access is just as important as EV access and that communities really have that availability across the board.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, on the demand part that Ines talked about, we have seen the demand go up because gas prices have been so high. And yet there's also some more recent data that's come out that along with the pullback in prices, the interest has waned a bit. We're still at 5% EV adoption in the US. Can that momentum continue, even with gas prices lower?KRISTIN SIEMEN: I think so. I mean, products are exciting. And when you see the new products that we're introducing, everything from the Equinox that I mentioned to the Cadillac LYRIQ, the Silverado EV, they're amazing products. Once you drive an EV and feel that instant acceleration and the flexibility and convenience that it provides, it's really hard to go back.AKIKO FUJITA: We'll be watching.KRISTIN SIEMEN: All right.AKIKO FUJITA: Kristin Siemen, chief sustainability officer at GM, good to have you in.KRISTIN SIEMEN: Thank you so much for having me.]"

Now the rental giant will start offering the EVs in the first quarter of next year, including the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV. Now the deal is similar to others that Hertz has made in the past, including those reached with Tesla and Polestar.GM CEO Mary Barra saying in a statement, quote, ""Our work with Hertz is a huge step forward for emissions reduction and EV adoption that will help create thousands of new EV customers for GM."" Again, taking a look at Hertz's stock, clearly has been under a significant amount of pressure just over the last couple of years since that bankruptcy filing, today trading at 18.14 a share.Mary Barra, Dave, saying that this will advance EV adoption. I think that as the case. Maybe a lot of people that wouldn't necessarily try EVs, if they rent them, then maybe would be more likely to buy them, although that same exact question remains just in terms of the infrastructure and our ability to transition to EV and how quickly that would look.- Infrastructure across the entire automobile sector is going to be a question in the months and years ahead. But you said those similar deals to Tesla and Polestar, much bigger though. Polestar's was for 60,000, and Tesla's for 100,000, 100 much bigger. And I think that says a lot-- and we've talked about this-- the diversity of products that GV is planning to roll out on the EV space, far blowing away what the offerings are from Tesla or from Polestar, who plans to have a million produced EVs GM by 2025 in both the US and China.

385,4915c70c-6c38-3023-b98a-66943ff6a34e,UAL,2022-09-22,3 Airline Stocks to Watch Amid Air-Travel Demand Strength,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-airline-stocks-watch-amid-184406037.html,1663785846,STORY,"['DAL', 'JBLU', 'UAL', '^GSPC']","[The easing of coronavirus-related restrictions spurred air-travel demand hugely. This is a huge positive for the Zacks Airline industry. The uptick in air traffic is likely to boost the top-line performance of airlines in the September quarter. Airline players like Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL and JetBlue Airways JBLU are likely to benefit from robust demand for air-travel.However, the sharp rise in fuel costs does not bode well for airlines, as expenses on this front are significant for players in this industry. The uptick in this key input cost limits bottom-line growth of the aviation stocks. The labor crunch is another headwind.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Airline industry houses players engaged in transporting passengers and cargoes to various destinations, globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of the companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst-hit corners by the pandemic with passenger revenues taking a severe beating. The subsequent focus on boosting cargo revenues is a positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryUptick in Air-Travel Demand Bodes Well: Air-travel demand, particularly for leisure, is very strong and aiding the top line of airlines. The strong air traffic generated during the Labor Day holiday period is likely to boost the top-line performance of airlines in the September quarter. Owing to strong air traffic, United Airlines upped its revenue growth view for the third quarter of 2022. UAL now anticipates total operating revenues to grow 12% from the September quarter’s level of 2019, higher than the prior expected growth rate of 11%Story continuesBottom-Line to Suffer Oil Price Increase: The current upsurge in oil price does not augur well for any airline stocks as far as its bottom-line growth is concerned as the uptick in fuel costs implies an increase in operating expenses. Notably, oil prices escalated 48% in first-half 2022, induced by the Russia-Ukraine war. JetBlue Airways increased its third-quarter projection for fuel cost per gallon by 18 cents to $3.86 as oil price moves north.Staffing Shortage a Bane: The airline industry in the United States is being plagued by tensions on the labor front. With airlines trimming their labor force substantially during the peak of the pandemic, the industry is grappling with staffing crunch as demand bounces back. Most airlines are facing pilot protests, demanding higher pay and better work conditions to abate the fatigue stemming from excessive workload following insufficient hands. Due to labor scarcity, many U.S. airlines trimmed their capacity this summer, which in turn, is likely to drain profitability. Reduced capacity is pushing up non-fuel unit costs. United Airlines expects consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, to increase roughly 16% in the September quarter from the corresponding 2019 levels.Focus on Cargo Revenues an Upside: With passenger revenues bouncing back from the pandemic lows, the simultaneous focus of airlines on their cargo units is likely to boost the top line further. For example, in the June quarter, cargo revenues surged 86% year over year at Delta. This was the best-ever performance of the cargo unit in the second quarter of a year.Per an IATA report, cargo revenues are likely to account for $191 billion of the industry revenues in 2022. The projected figure is nearly double the $100 billion recorded in 2019. Overall, airlines are expected to carry more than 68 million tonnes of cargo in the current year.

UAL has canceled 25 Boeing 777-200 airplanes from service this week on failure to complete the required inspections on the wing leading-edge panels. On Monday night and Tuesday morning, it canceled around 18 flights.United Airlines had already reported the issue to the Federal Aviation Administration (""FAA"") through an internal audit, after which a plan was made accordingly to conduct the inspections.The airline has completed inspections of 10 aircrafts and is coordinating with the FAA to complete the remaining ones.While inspections will be carried for the next two weeks, the FAA is also trying to understand what led to the delay. The latest wing leading-edge panel inspections of 777-200 planes are not related to engines or recent engine work and are expected to get completed overnight.We remind investors that United Airlines’ Boeing 777 jets, powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney 4000 engines, had been grounded after a Honolulu-bound flight suffered an engine failure in February 2021 and made an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport. Following the explosion of the engine debris rained on Denver suburbs. However, no one suffered injuries and the aircraft landed safely.Such flight disruptions due to inspection failure seem to be a hindrance for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) airline company.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. JB Hunt (JBHT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 21, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.54 a share.JBHT has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.39%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.54 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43.JBHT is just one of a large group of Transportation stocks with a positive ESP figure. United Airlines (UAL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.United Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 18, 2022. UAL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.33 a share 27 days from its next earnings release.For United Airlines, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 is 8.07%.Story continuesJBHT and UAL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova is here with the latest on what seemed to be a rather contentious day, as we usually expect with the bank CEOs on Capitol Hill.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Dave. Well, these testimonies got lost in the chaos of today's Fed decision and Putin's warning, of course. But there were some incredibly interesting exchanges between congressional leaders and these CEOs. The questioning was on a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, racial inequities, particularly in their lending practices, overdraft fees, and many other items.And while these hearings hardly ever result in any kind of legislative action, it is incredibly consequential for these CEOs to be put on the spot and grilled by congressional members. Some of the takeaways were remarks from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Again, he was talking about the Federal Reserve possibly still achieving a soft landing, but warning lawmakers that they should be prepared for the worst. Somewhat of a similar warning from Citibank's Jane Fraser. She said that we're going to be in for tough times ahead.And notable also was a very heated exchange between California Congressman Brad Sherman and Jamie Dimon. And Sherman questioned Dimon and Fraser about whether they still have any stakes in Russian oil companies, to which they appeared to respond with some hesitation. And things didn't go well for Dimon when he tried to add on to the conversation. Let's take a listen.- Let me go on to Citigroup. Have you cut your ties with Lukoil and Vitol?JAMIE DIMON: He said one other thing. I don't think--- Not on my time, you can.JAMIE DIMON: No one is doing--- Reclaiming my time, Mr. Dimon.- The time belongs to the gentleman from California.Story continues- You can do a press conference afterwards and comment as you like, not on my time.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Quite contentious there. There was also a lot of discussion on the geopolitical front. Jamie Dimon said that the biggest threat to US financial stability are China and Ukraine, speaking in terms of the escalating economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, but also talking about the possibility of China taking military action against Taiwan. The bank execs were asked if they would pull investments in China if that happened, and they said that they would follow government guidelines on that.And also separately, there were discussions about competing with Chinese banks. And Jamie Dimon said that it's very important that America maintains financial supremacy. And again, these discussions are still underway. We have a second day of hearings tomorrow with a lot to be addressed.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and it was an interesting dichotomy. It's more evidence that it used to be along party lines. Democrats would hammer away at the bank CEOs, and Republicans were largely supportive. That was not the case today. We've seen that pivot, and in particular, with ENG and things-- ESG, excuse me. That narrative is definitely changing with the GOP. Alexandra Semenova, great stuff. I can't believe somebody talked to Jamie Dimon that way, but it is entertaining. Rachelle.]"

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuitive Surgical's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.5b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's moderate 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 20% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is ISRG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Intuitive Surgical Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

It beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed and matched once, the average surprise being 1.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring the Stock?Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces risks associated with open surgery. The company continues to gain from this system, which in turn bolsters overall performance.Intuitive Surgical had 7,135 da Vinci surgical systems by the end of the second quarter of 2022, with the installed base rising 12.6% year over year. For 2022, the company projects procedure growth of 12-16%.

Intuitive Hub — unified hardware and software solution for the operating room — allows OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and partner virtually by utilizing existing workflows and intuitive systems. In the first quarter, the company introduced an upgraded interface to the da Vinci systems, enabling automated video capture with integrated procedure annotation for key events and building convenient video storage and review for event cases.Story continuesThe FDA clearance earlier this year for integrating mobile cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging technology with its minimally-invasive, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy system, Ion Endoluminal System, is likely to benefit the company.

This was driven by substantial growth in procedure volume. Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the prior-year quarter. Of these, 78 were in Europe, 18 in Japan and 15 in China.What’s Weighing on the Company?The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the global supply of semiconductors and other materials utilized in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company has been making every effort to secure the supply required to fulfill consumer demand, global shortages might result in higher output costs or delay in production.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $6.2 billion, suggesting growth of 8.6% from the year-ago reported number, while the same for earnings stands at $4.56 per share, indicating a decline of 8.1%.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

BXP recently closed the acquisition of 125 Broadway in Kendall Square. The six-story laboratory/life sciences property was purchased from Biogen for $592 million.Biogen has signed a lease for the 271,000 square feet property, by which it will continue occupying the entire property through April 2028.The building is located adjacent to Kendall Center, a 2.2 million square feet portfolio belonging to BXP in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA.Cambridge being one of the largest and most important clusters of life sciences companies and research space in the United States, the acquisition seems a strategic fit for Boston Properties.The drug research and innovation business is experiencing solid growth driven by the need for effective diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. This has increased demand for BXP’s life-science assets covering more than 3 million square feet in the leading innovation markets of Boston, Cambridge, Waltham/Lexington, MA, Montgomery County, MD, and San Francisco and Los Angeles, CA.Moreover, Boston Properties has an encouraging development pipeline with 6 million square feet of life sciences-focused development opportunities. This includes around 1 million square feet of current lab developments and redevelopments underway, anticipated to be delivered in the next 36 months. This positions the company well for growth.Per Bryan Koop, executive vice president, Boston Region, of BXP, “BXP has been an integral member of the Cambridge community since the development of our first property in 1981, and we are pleased to continue to grow and evolve Kendall Center to meet the needs of the life sciences community.”The latest acquisition was funded through cash and borrowings available under BXP’s line of credit. Moreover, Boston Properties plans to own the property with one or more joint venture equity partners and is assessing opportunities for the same.Following the acquisition of 125 Broadway, Boston Properties and Biogen ended their lease agreement for 300 Binney Street to enable the conversion and expansion of the property to a 240,000 square feet of laboratory/life sciences space. The six-story property encompassing 195,000 square feet is adjacent to 125 Broadway and was developed by BXP in 2013.Furthermore, Boston Properties has signed a 15-year lease with a well-known life sciences organization, which is anticipated to commence once the renovations are completed by late 2024.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BXP’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates moving northward over the past month.However, its shares have lost 10.6% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry's fall of 1.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Prologis PLD, SBA Communications SBAC and Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts XHR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) so let's look a bit deeper.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on CSX is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.6b ÷ (US$40b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, CSX has an ROCE of 15%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 15%. See our latest analysis for CSX roceIn the above chart we have measured CSX's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for CSX.So How Is CSX's ROCE Trending?CSX is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 36% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Key TakeawayTo bring it all together, CSX has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 76% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with CSX and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

420,a4aa66ad-7160-3056-97a0-88a89a7993c3,SBAC,2022-09-22,Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy SBA Communications (SBAC) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-growth-investors-buy-sba-164504401.html,1663778704,STORY,['SBAC'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends SBA Communications (SBAC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this communications tower operator is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for SBA Communications is 12.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 13.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 9.8%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, SBA Communications has an S/TA ratio of 0.25, which means that the company gets $0.25 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.12, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And SBA Communications is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.8% this year versus the industry average of 10.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for SBA Communications have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.Bottom LineSBA Communications has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that SBA Communications is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To this end, GM Sectec in partnership with Cybersource, a Visa solution, will now offer payment and risk management services supported by GM Sectec's cybersecurity expertise.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital payments globally and especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, as buyers and sellers continue to expand their use of contactless, on-line and remote payment capabilities. The use of the Internet is increasingly present in people's daily lives and financial institutions are increasingly exposed to constant security threat vectors. This situation has led to an increase in the number of cyber-attacks and the need to reinforce the security of transactions made through digital channels.The 6th edition of Visa's Global Back to Business study finds that 73% of small businesses surveyed said accepting new forms of digital payments is fundamental to growth in 2022. 59% of small businesses surveyed said they already are, or plan to, only use digital payments within the next two years – largely in step with 41% of consumers surveyed who said the same. 90% of small businesses surveyed with an online presence said they attributed pandemic survival to increased efforts to sell online[1].These figures show the importance of companies implementing an effective cybersecurity strategy that allows them to continue to grow, while offering secure shopping experiences to their customers. Through this collaboration, GM Sectec and Visa will continue to inform the financial ecosystem on the topic of cybersecurity and further support the development and implementation of solutions to mitigate threats, safeguarding the integrity of their systems and protecting consumers.Story continuesFor the fourth consecutive year, both companies will continue the PaySec Talks initiative. These are learning experiences meant to educate and guide organizations in understanding the importance of having cybersecurity tools and procedures that help protect their data and that of their customers and promote an understanding for their true cyber risk and fraud prevention techniques. In addition, through this partnership, GM Sectec offers Visa clients unique support in PCI validation services, cybersecurity consulting, and fraud prevention assessments.""One of the biggest concerns for businesses and organizations of all types, sizes and industries is how to protect the personal data and sensitive information of hundreds of thousands of users, customers and consumers who rely on them to conduct their daily transactions through various channels and platforms, many of them digital. The strengthening of our partnership with Visa, will allow organizations of all types across the payment system to engage cyber defense best practices with the support of a trusted cyber defense leader,"" said Hector Guillermo Martinez, president of GM Sectec.""For Visa, keeping the digital movement of money secure is our number one priority,"" said Eduardo Perez, Chief Risk Officer for Visa in Latin America and the Caribbean. ""Partnerships like this one, enables us to continue to innovate in solutions that provide buyers and sellers with increasingly secure, convenient, and frictionless payment experiences, both online or physically at the point of sale.""Considering Cybersecurity Awareness Month that takes place in October – a collaborative effort to raise awareness on the importance of online security - GM Sectec and Visa will kick off their Paysec Talks series in Latin America, starting on September 27th in Mexico City.

(NYSE:V) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 28x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Visa has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Visa peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Visa.How Is Visa's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Visa's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 37% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 32% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 17% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Visa's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Visa's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Story continuesA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

It's in my family's blood. We have an aligned vision of really pushing boundaries and in the hotel industry. We are reaching levels that we've never seen before, even pre-COVID.[MUSIC PLAYING]ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Sonia Cheng, CEO of the Rosewood Hotel Group. Sonia, nice to see you.SONIA CHENG: Nice to see you, Andy.ANDY SERWER: Thanks so much for joining us from Hong Kong. You have a really fascinating job and just an incredible hotel company with incredible properties, such as the Hotel de Crillon, The Carlyle in New York, Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, Little Dix, Silicon Valley and Sand Hill Road, all those properties. Having said that, there are other luxury brand hotels out there as well, and I'm wondering what you think really differentiates Rosewood versus some of those other luxury names?SONIA CHENG: So Rosewood, what's so special about Rosewood is it's a sense of place philosophy. So globally, we operate 30 properties around the world and every property has its own personality. Its philosophy is to celebrate local culture, its history, really bringing in that sense of place into the hotel so that all our travelers that come to the hotel can experience the beauty of that city. And so every property is carefully curated, really personalized, and really, it's a very special collection. So it's not, I wouldn't call it a chain, it's really a very special collection of beautiful hotels and landmark properties around the world.ANDY SERWER: Given that each one of the properties is so differentiated, Sonia, how do you oversee such a diverse group a portfolio like this?Story continuesSONIA CHENG: Well, first of all, we have an amazing team. They are around the world. They're very talented, very passionate in the hospitality businesses, very creative, and we have an aligned vision of really pushing boundaries in the hotel industry. So we take a very thoughtful approach every time we open a hotel.And we studied the market, we understand what the consumers are looking for each market, and we're very involved from the beginning of the design process, understanding what our target audience are looking for, curating every experience from culinary to wellness to the guest experience in the room. And also it's important for us to be immersed in that culture and to bring in those cultural experiences in every touchpoint and throughout the journey. So we don't open that many hotels every year. We carefully select the properties to make sure that every property is really special and certainly a landmark for that destination.ANDY SERWER: How many properties do you have right now and how many are you planning to open up, say, over the next 12 months? And what is that trajectory like versus before COVID? And we'll talk about COVID, of course, in particular, but just where does the business stand versus, say, 2019?SONIA CHENG: So for the Rosewood brand, we operate 30 hotels around the world in 18 countries. And we've announced 24 projects that are in the pipeline at the moment. And surprisingly, while COVID has a significant impact on the hospitality industry, we have experienced tremendous growth in our pipeline in the last two years. Developers and owners in the hospitality space continue to be quite confident in the outlook of the hotel industry and continue to invest in hotels and looking to partner with Rosewood in developing more Rosewoods around the world. So actually, the last two years, we have record high signings of new hotels in the pipeline.ANDY SERWER: So take me back to March of 2020, though, and as the pandemic unfolded, how did you respond and how did you guys survive over, say, those two critical years?SONIA CHENG: So it was certainly a very challenging time. I think it was an unprecedented time for all of us in the hotel industry. We did not prepare for it. And so we reacted very quickly.The key to addressing this crisis is to be very flexible. We immediately take care of our associates, number one. Number two, we address key concerns of our consumers, our guests, and took a very flexible approach in the hotel to make sure that all the health and hygiene standards are there. We take into considerations what our guests are looking for to ensure that it is a safe and an exclusive environment that they feel safe to stay in.And also, we react very quickly in terms of different markets and market needs. So for example, Rosewood Hong Kong, we pivoted very quickly, the business to staycation. So we were the first hotel in Hong Kong to launch a staycation program, because everyone in Hong Kong couldn't travel abroad. So we basically turned the hotel into an urban resort where we launched kids program, a summer program where the local residents can use our hotel as a vacation spot, and that was really successful.And then we was an industry leader in implementing staycation. As well, we noticed during COVID, the trend of consumers looking for more privacy, exclusivity. So there's an uptick in staying in bigger villas. We developed much more curated and personalized experience in our residences and our villas. So I think the key is we maintain significant and constant communication with our team around the world so that we're able to address concerns of our associates and the organization as well as the consumers very quickly.ANDY SERWER: So I imagine you took some of those learnings and you actually kept going with those things, right? Has that been the case?SONIA CHENG: Absolutely. So I think over COVID, the revelation is that some of the consumers' behavior has changed. They are more focused on personalized experience, number one, they care about their own well-being, they care about lifestyle, they love to travel, they miss travel, so there's a significant pent up demand, and it also allows us to discover a new territory of, how do we bring Rosewood to their home? So we actually ramped up our digital transformation.We are developing, we are pivoting our strategy of developing Rosewood to be beyond just a luxury hotel leader, but we want it to be a comprehensive lifestyle leader, where we are diversifying our portfolio. We launched Asaya during that time, a complete holistic wellness concept that really takes care of our consumers, not just in a traditional hotel spa. We launched our private membership concept in Hong Kong called Carlyle &amp; Co. where it gives a safe space, an exclusive space for private members.We also ramp up our offerings and our development on Rosewood Residences. So 50% of our Rosewood portfolio has Rosewood Residences. And then finally, we also piloted our retail offering, so really extending our Rosewood ecosystem where we can impact people's lives and give them a curated Rosewood experience wherever they are.ANDY SERWER: Wow, that's a lot of stuff. I mean, you probably never would have done those things, all those things, certainly not in that time period, had it not been for COVID, right?SONIA CHENG: I think that COVID gave us time to take a step back and pause and observe how consumers are behaving and how they're evolving and it accelerated some of the plans that are going to stay.ANDY SERWER: Yeah. So yours is a family business. Your grandfather was the patriarch of the family company, and your father, and then you joined after college then working on Wall Street.Tell us about that journey. You went to school high school in the United States, then you went to Harvard, and then, as I said, after Wall Street joined. What was that process like?SONIA CHENG: It was amazing. So after I graduated from Harvard, I went into the finance industry, which I did a few years in investment banking and then a few years at private equity. And those experience was amazing. It gave me a very solid foundation in terms of how to analyze operating companies, build the financial skills that I need in the future.And then after I think about five years, then I started venturing into the hospitality business. Hospitality has always been my passion. It's in our family blood, as you mention. My grandfather and my father were pioneers in the luxury hotel space in Asia.They were the first one to develop the first luxury hotel in Hong Kong. They were the first one to develop the first luxury hotel in China. At one point, with the New World Hotels, we were one of the biggest player in Asia at that time. And my grandfather and my father always loved the hospitality business and I've always been growing up surrounded by the hotel business. We lived next door to the hotel.I used to go with my father when he was looking after the hotel business to look at operations. I traveled around the world with them. So that's how I developed my passion. And so after the finance experience, I immediately ventured into the hotel business.ANDY SERWER: And so you had some background in it, but basically, you were learning as you were going initially and then when did you take the reins of the business itself?SONIA CHENG: So I joined in 2008, around 2008, 2009. And you're correct, I didn't have the traditional hotel education. I didn't go to Hotel School. But because when I joined, I was so passionate that I spent the first two years really almost a crash course in hotels, meeting as many people as possible in the hotel industry, different companies, talking to a lot of from market leaders, to influencers, to travel experts to really understand, what are the needs in the hotel industry?What are the offerings and what are the white space? And then those first two years, the other thing I did was I knew that I need a very strong management team. So I spent the first two years hiring and recruiting the best talents to join my team to be partners on our exciting journey. And then fast forward in 2011, the key pivotal point was the acquisition of Rosewood in 2011.ANDY SERWER: Right. How does your family, do you guys have family meetings where you talk about all the businesses together? How does your family operate that way?SONIA CHENG: Actually, we're pretty casual. My father is a great mentor. He really loves the hotel business. So every time we have family dinners, he will discuss with me on hotel operations, give me advice, share with me his observation whenever he goes around to the hotels, and we would have really open discussion and discuss how we can improve, how we can involve, and how do we develop the brand.ANDY SERWER: Right. And then you have brothers who are in other businesses that are part of the family group as well, right?SONIA CHENG: That's correct.ANDY SERWER: So tell us what's going on a little bit in Hong Kong, Sonia, in terms of the business environment. We read so much here in the United States about changes and disruption, COVID, political issues. How would you describe the environment right now?SONIA CHENG: Well, Hong Kong recently relaxed their travel restrictions, coming to Hong Kong on the quarantine, so that's really good news. We're already seeing an uptick in travel coming into Hong Kong once the restriction was lifted. I'm very confident that once the quarantine restrictions are lifted completely, there will be a very quick recovery in Hong Kong.I think there's a significant pent up demand in coming to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is still the one of the world's most important financial hub, business hub, cultural hub. And we're very confident in terms of Hong Kong's future and outlook and hopefully the restrictions will relax very soon and we'll see a very significant recovery.ANDY SERWER: And just one more question along those lines. I mean, running a global business like this, are you concerned about the way the world seems to be going in terms of being anti-globalists, and the world being more divided up, and travel being more difficult between countries because of political tensions, not just COVID? Is that something you consider?SONIA CHENG: I think now, in a line of business as I see with the recovery of COVID, we see a significant pent up demand to travel. If you look at the recovery path, whether it is in China, whether it's in Europe and the US, the trend is the same. As soon as restrictions are lifted, people want to go back to what was their normal lives period pre-COVID.They want to see their family, they want to see their friends, they want to meet their colleagues. So what we're experiencing in our hotels are a very quick recovery. Whether it's in the US or Europe, and now Southeast Asia, we are reaching levels that we've never seen before even pre-COVID. So overall, I'm very confident in the hospitality space and its outlook.ANDY SERWER: Right. And so just to follow up on that, are you kind of back to 2019 levels?SONIA CHENG: Oh, some of the hotels are beyond 2019 levels. We have resorts in Mexico that it's experiencing rates and occupancy that they have never seen before since opening. So there's a huge pent up demand.ANDY SERWER: Now, on the other hand, part of the problems with this demand are twofold. One, which is labor shortages, and two, supply chain so. I'd like to ask you about both of those things.And I know it may be hard to generalize about both, since you are such a global business. But what about, let's just take them one at a time, what about labor shortages? How is that playing out in various markets, Sonia?SONIA CHENG: So, we are experiencing labor challenges, I think as with everyone else in the hotel space and travel industry. However, in the last couple of months, we've been able to recruit the talent that we have been looking for. I think that it's very important to reintroduce the beauty of the hotel industry to the talents out there. I think that because of COVID, they temporarily left the industry, but a lot actually wanted to come back.So I think it's important to focus on building an organization where we are communicating to our talents that this is a learning organization. What is your career path? Focusing on building a purpose-led organization, which the new generation of talents, that's what they're looking for.So really shifting focus on, how do we make the hospitality industry attractive again? And it all comes down to people. It all comes down to leadership and what are you trying to build as an organization? And we've been seeing some success. We had a little bit of a bump last couple years, but then we've seen some success in recruiting back the talents.ANDY SERWER: And as far as supply chain goes, how is that affecting your business, just in terms of being able to source everything, from food to linens to construction materials? And is that impacting pricing? And are you seeing inflation being a problem?SONIA CHENG: So we're starting to seeing some rise in cost in our properties and our hotel operations in the US and Europe and we are addressing it. I think that we are looking at different methods of optimizing our operations. The good thing is, because the pent up demand of travel is there, and we're seeing such a surge of travel and rates are increasing as well, so overall, the impact currently is still manageable.ANDY SERWER: Right. So you have some pricing flexibility in terms of what you're able to charge. Shifting gears a little bit, Sonia, I want to ask you about being a woman leader in the business and what that's been like, and how singular that is and what your experience has been.SONIA CHENG: I think that, for Rosewood, I think women in the hospitality industry, we can offer a very unique perspective to the hospitality industry. And I can speak for myself, I'm a mother of four at the moment and I find it a very tremendous experience to be in the hotel industry, because previously, you were saying that there's challenges of work and family balance. And but what I realize is nowadays, a lot of women travel with their family on vacation. There's a trend of developing blending work with leisure at the same time.And for us women, we have a different lens in the hotel industry where we can shed a different light that can help evolve the experience in hotels. So for example, because I have four children and I know what is important to children, the last couple of years we revamped our children's program, which is called Rose Explorer. So previously, in different hotels, kids clubs are seen as this 50 square meter room where you have some art table, you have some books and that's the kids club to house the children in resorts. But because I have children, I have a different perspective.And Rosewood Phuket, for example, we've launched a new kids program where we built in a lot more educational experience from programs to learn about coral reef, to a herb garden. So they learn about organic planting, to tie weaving stations. So it's a very diverse education experience and kids love it and families are going to Rosewood because we have an amazing kids program. And I wouldn't have developed that had I not become a mother.So I think women can really provide a different perspective to the industry. The other example I want to give you is about development of Asaya. And when we launched the Asaya concept, we created a focus group with a lot of women and talked to them about what their needs are and what they're looking for that is beyond a traditional spa. So those inspirations are very important and critical for our hotel industry to continue to develop and continue to evolve our concept.ANDY SERWER: That's fascinating. I think you're also using data analytics to personalize hotel stays more and more. Can you talk to us about where that's going?SONIA CHENG: Yeah, so I think it's very important that we recognize our consumers' behavior, our guests' behavior on a regular basis. So we are building a very strong CRM program globally for our hotels where we are able to understand our customer's need in advance, and so that our approach and our service approach is much more intuitive. We're building a data lake where we are capturing these data and allowing our associates at the property to provide those experience in a much more personal way.ANDY SERWER: And what about sustainability? Is that important to you and how has that manifested both from an operational standpoint, Sonia, and also maybe from the standpoint of something that the guests might experience?SONIA CHENG: Yes, absolutely. So sustainability is very important to us. We have just launched our social impact vision, in fact, which is called Rosewood Impact. And the vision really covers how we are going to support community, as well as play our part in protecting the planet.And we have been doing a lot of sustainability efforts and initiatives and programs for decades now. We have a global food waste program where we try to reduce wastage, as well as reduce energy around the world. And then we have just opened Rosa Sao Paulo for example, which is one of the largest upcycling project in Brazil, in fact.And we're committed to, within a year, to achieve 100% renewable energy through solar panels and hopefully to achieve, as a group, carbon neutrality in the future. So sustainability is very much a core pillar in our organization. We've been doing a lot, but we recognize that we need to do more to help sustain and protect the planet.ANDY SERWER: And you just mentioned Sao Paulo. Can you tell us where you're going to be opening other properties over the next year?SONIA CHENG: So beyond Brazil, you mean?ANDY SERWER: Yes. Yeah.SONIA CHENG: Yes, absolutely. So for Rosewood the brand, I mean, we've announced about 24 projects around the world. Next year is a very exciting year for us. We're opening quite a few amazing projects.We're opening a Rosewood Amsterdam. We're opening in Rosewood Munich. We're opening our first hotel in Hawaii, Kona Village. We're also venturing into Middle East and opening Rosewood Doha as well. So very exciting openings in the next year.ANDY SERWER: Sounds like you're going to be racking up those frequent flyer miles, Sonia, right?SONIA CHENG: Yes, hopefully. I think next year onwards the travel will be quite intense.ANDY SERWER: All right, final question, and I know you're not going to be able to answer this because this is like the same thing, me asking you which one of your kids is your favorite kid. So I'm going to ask you, which one of your hotel properties is your favorite property? Or is there any way that you can maybe say, well, something really sticks out in your mind that you kind of really dig?SONIA CHENG: I mean, a lot of people ask me that question and I will give the same answer. I really do not have a favorite. Every Rosewood property really have a special place in my heart. Everyone has their own story. From Rosewood Hong Kong, which is my home, my home city. I used to live in that area, so it has a special place in my heart. To Rosewood Beijing, which is our first hotel in Asia. To a Hotel de Crillon in Paris, which is a tremendous landmark in Paris. And so every property really has an amazing spot in my heart, so I can't really say who's the favorite.ANDY SERWER: You have the dozens of hotels and the four kids and you love them all. I can't blame. You can't single any of them out. That makes sense, right?SONIA CHENG: Exactly.ANDY SERWER: Sonia Cheng, CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group. Thank you so much for your time.SONIA CHENG: Thank you, Andy. Thank you.ANDY SERWER: You've been watching ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. We'll see you next time.[AUDIO LOGO]]"

Neil van Niekerk / SkiftMergers and acquisitions have become particularly attractive for companies in dozens of industries post-pandemic, but not for Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano.“We don’t feel a burning need to do a (merger and acquisition) deal just for the sake of growth,” said Capuano in discussion with Senior Hospitality Editor Sean O’Neill at Skift Global Forum on Tuesday.Attendees polled at the Skift Global Forum were almost evenly split when asked if they think two of the big six hotel groups — Accor, IHG, Marriott, Hilton, Jin Jiang, Wyndham, and Choice — will merge in the next two years. While Capuano said he wouldn’t be surprised to see consolidation among smaller companies hit hard by the pandemic, he described mergers as “damn hard.” Marriott acquired Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide in 2016 in a complicated $13.6 billion deal that involved roughly 5,700 properties and 30 brands — and lots of adjustments to be made after, particularly merging loyalty programs.What’s more, “the regulatory obstacle course you need to run is challenging,” Capuano said.But Marriott has entered into a partnership with hotelier Ian Schrager, with whom the hotel giant is opening the Tampa EDITION, the first five-star hotel in the Florida city. Capuano shot down a report that Schrager was hesitant about the partnership.“I talked to him this morning, and I can give you a lot of adjectives, but wishy-washy would not be one of them,” said Capuano.“I have worked with Ian now for 12 or 13 years, and I have such deep admiration for not only his creativity but his passion. He loves to create. He loves this brand. We did not renew our exclusivity with him, but we have 15 active projects.”However, it’s unlikely Marriott would consider a marketing partnership with another company.“We all want to own that relationship with the guest. There is a moat that protects the ownership of the stay, and we are hesitant to let someone else participate in that,” said Capuano.Meanwhile, Capuano reiterated Marriott’s goal to meet global gender parity in its executive positions by 2023, two years ahead of the company’s original target. He added that he wants to see people of color to hold least 25 percent of its executive positions in the U.S. by 2025.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, coastal areas topped August's list of least affordable rental markets, with rents accounting for the highest shares of household incomes in Miami (46.5%), Los Angeles (40.7%) and San Diego (37.1%).""Our analysis underscores the very real rental affordability challenges that many Americans face today. Rents are significantly higher than in previous years and are taking up a substantial portion of incomes, which are growing at a slower pace than inflation,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Still, there are some bright spots for renters as of late. Based on the general rule of thumb that you should keep housing costs to under 30% of your paycheck, renters were able to follow best practice in the majority of large metros in August. Plus, as rent growth continued to cool, national rents didn't hit a new record-high for the first time in nine months.1 If these trends and typical seasonal cooling persist, renters may be better able to keep housing costs to a relatively manageable portion of their budgets in the months ahead.""Hale added, the U.S. median rental price declined for the first time since November 2021 in August, to $1,771 from $1,781 in July.1 Additionally, rent growth continued moderating on a year-over-year basis, down to a single-digit increase (+9.8%) after 13 straight months at a double-digit pace. However, national rents remained more than 20% higher than in August 2020 overall (+22.8%) and across all unit sizes: Studios at a median $1,489 (+21.2%), one-beds at a median $1,653 (22.6%), and two-beds at a median $1,964 (+23.2%).Story continuesAugust 2022 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentChange over Aug. 2021Change over Aug. 2020Overall$1,7719.8 %22.8 %Studio$1,48911.8 %21.2 %1-bed$1,6539.3 %22.6 %2-bed$1,9649.1 %23.2 %Rental affordability worsens nationwide and especially in coastal metros Despite the cooldown in annual rent growth, August data indicates that rental affordability issues are rising.

Rental units include apartment communities as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). All units were studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units. National rents were calculated by averaging the medians of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history going back to March 2019.Rental affordability analysis: The affordable monthly rent is calculated by applying the 30% rule to the estimated 2022 monthly median household income nationwide ($6,716 across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average) and in each metro. The monthly median household income is derived from the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas. Due to the methodology changes noted below, Realtor.com has made historical revisions to its prior affordability analyses. For our most recently published affordability analysis on February 2022 data published in March 2022, the national rent-to-income share has been updated to 25.0%.Note on new methodology: With the release of its August 2022 Monthly Rental Report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting rental listing trends and metrics. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since September 2022 will not be directly comparable with previous releases, but future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.

(""AIR"") (NYSE: AIRC) today provided an operating update on its change in Same Store Rental Rates and Average Daily Occupancy as of August 31, 2022. The Company remains on track to meet guidance for 2022 as described in its second quarter 2022 earnings release.Q2 2022July 2022August 2022Transacted LeasesRenewal rent changes11.1%10.6%11.0%New lease rent changes18.9%17.9%17.4%Weighted-average rent changes14.3%14.0%14.0%Signed LeasesRenewal rent changes10.6%11.8%11.9%New lease rent changes18.4%19.5%17.0%Weighted-average rent changes14.1%15.5%14.3%Average Daily Occupancy96.8%95.5%96.0%In the Same Store portfolio, which represents 87% of AIR’s GAV, blended transacted leases increased by 14.0% in August, the highest among coastal peers. Occupancy is projected to continue to increase with the summer leasing season now complete, and full year controllable operating expenses are expected to remain roughly flat.In the last 18 months, AIR has improved and grown its portfolio through leverage neutral ""paired trades,"" which has allowed for recycling capital into properties with superior prospects, enhanced further by AIR’s property operations and the application of the AIR Edge. The Acquisition portfolio, comprising properties acquired by AIR in 2021 and 2022, now amounts to 13% of AIR’s GAV. Blended transacted leases from AIR’s 2021 acquisitions were up 24.0% in August, 1,000 basis points higher than the Same Store portfolio.With the pandemic now over, we can track AIR’s progress and how Keith Kimmel and his team continue to excel:In 18 months, AIR’s high-quality portfolio was made even better. Average monthly revenue per apartment home, $2,231 at year-end 2020, is now $2,596, third among all peers, representing $2,586 from the Same Store portfolio, pro forma for the announced anticipated sale of the Boston communities, and $2,663 from the Acquisition portfolio and four lease cancellations with Aimco.AIR is the leader among coastal peers in Same Store Revenue growth measured from 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic, through 2022, based on the midpoint of peer guidance ranges.AIR’s acquisitions in 2022 are off to a great start, and the Acquisitions made in 2021 continue to outperform our expectations, on track to produce ~50% higher Same Store NOI growth in the fourth quarter.Through focus on high NOI margins and low G&amp;A, AIR has demonstrated that its business model is more efficient than any of its peers in the conversion of Same Store Revenue into free cash flow.Story continuesThe economy is unusually turbulent, but AIR’s early prospects for 2023 are excellent. At year-end, the expected earn-in from 2022 leasing activities is expected to provide approximately 5% Same Store Revenue growth in 2023, with expected loss-to-lease providing the opportunity for additional growth.About AIRApartment Income REIT Corp.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Tapestry's (NYSE:TPR) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tapestry is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$7.3b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Thus, Tapestry has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Luxury industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Tapestry compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Tapestry here  for free.What Can We Tell From Tapestry's ROCE Trend?Tapestry's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 32% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Bottom Line On Tapestry's ROCEAs discussed above, Tapestry appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And given the stock has remained rather flat over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here if other metrics are strong. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Tapestry, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

In his keynote, CEO Jensen Huang called the new GPU a “quantum leap” which will give creators the ability to build fully simulated worlds.The H100 -- touted as the most powerful AI-focused GPU the company has manufactured, which is based on the Hopper architecture and armed with Hopper’s next-generation Transformer Engine -- is now in full production and will begin shipping via OEMs in October.Huang also said that the 2nd-generation OVX systems – designed for scaling out metaverse applications and set to be powered by Ada Lovelace L40 data center GPUs - are also now in full production.That’s just a taster of all the things on offer. Yet, the Street’s tepid reaction is perhaps a reflection of the sheen Nvidia has lost over the past year; dwindling Gaming sales, the expected loss of GPU revenue over the Ethereum merge and the US government’s restrictions on exports of the H100 to China have all helped sour sentiment for this once unstoppable growth story.But write off Nvidia at your peril, appears to be the stance of Rosneblatt’s Hans Mosesmann. The 5-star analyst thinks the Street is completely underappreciating the seismic changes at play.“Ada Lovelace and the compute big brother Hopper are set to be the biggest GPU launches in the history of GPUs and we dare say the biggest compute launches in the last generation in Silicon Valley,” Mosesmann wrote excitedly. “We get that the Street is snake bit and perhaps not in the mood for all the GTC cool stuff that is hugely strategic. Much less internalized what Nvidia is doing with its Omniverse/AI thrust (cloud services, OVX computers, Enterprise S/W, Orin, Thor, and we could go on and on). But longer-term investors will be rewarded in our opinion as in past cycles.""Story continuesMosesmann’s confidence is conveyed in his Buy rating and backed by a Street-high $320 price target, suggesting shares will be changing hands for a 141% premium a year from now. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here)Mosesmann is hardly the only analyst to come out bullish for NVDA; the stock has a 23 to 9 split in favor of Buy reviews over Holds, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $132.61 and their $205.74 average target suggests room for 55% appreciation next year.

The global business environment continues to be challenging. A dull Cell Supply business might dampen top-line growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Charles River exited the second quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The results highlighted 9.5% organic revenue growth, driven by strength across the DSA and Research Models and Services RMS business segments.In the second quarter, RMS revenues increased 8.5% organically year over year, in line with the company’s high single-digit outlook for 2022. Organic revenue growth was driven by strong demand and meaningful price increases in the Research Models business in North America, as well as for Global Research Models Services, particularly Insourcing Solutions and GEMS. China continued to perform well but the growth rate was impacted by COVID-related restrictions in the Beijing and Shanghai region.This segment reported 12.9% organic revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022. The DSA organic growth rate improved nearly 340 basis points from the first-quarter level and reached the low double-digit range. This was driven by the Safety Assessment business, which continued to benefit from strong business trends such as higher pricing and increased demand. Based on demand and backlog trends, including working through higher pricing that is already booked, Charles River continues to expect that the growth rate will approach 20% in the second half of 2022, tracking to its initial plan. Higher demand and meaningful price increases led to sequential growth acceleration in the Safety Assessment business in the second quarter.Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. PriceCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. PriceCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. price | Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. QuoteFor 2022, the company continues to expect the DSA segment to be the primary driver of modest operating margin improvement as leverage from the accelerated DSA growth rate offsets higher compensation costs.Operating margin expansion and meaningful cash flow generation were the other upsides. We expect the company to register a 4.8% improvement in adjusted net income in 2022 on 10.2% revenue growth.Story continuesA revenue decline in the CDMO business, as well as a challenging prior-year comparison for the Biologics Testing and Microbial Solutions businesses in the second quarter, dragged Manufacturing Solutions revenues down. The Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined 460 basis points to 28.6% as a result of the expense escalation within the CDMO business.The significant slash in 2022 guidance reflects headwinds associated with the CDMO business, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the strengthening U.S. dollar and interest expense due to the rising interest rate environment, increases concern.In the pandemic period, the company’s Cell Supply business is facing issues related to donor access. The Cell Supply business, including the HemaCare and Cellero, continued to be impacted by donor availability constraints, which failed to recover from COVID-related restrictions completely.Over the past year, Charles River has been underperforming its industry. The stock has declined 51.7% compared with the industry’s 33.2% plunge.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

However, pricing pressure remains a headwind.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 18.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 44.1% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 19% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $83.5 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 8.8% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 4.25% compares favorably with the industry’s (4.2%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, courtesy of the platform’s unique features, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These, in turn, position it well to sustain momentum in robot sales.The company is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. In the second quarter, the Mako installed base saw 19% year-over-year growth and currently is moving toward 1500 Mako robots. Thus, the company continues to focus on the continued expansion of the platform. This growth reflects the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Taking into account the normalization of the customer environment, management anticipates another strong year for Mako in 2022. The company’s Mako order book remains solid for 2022 and is in sync with its aim of continued share gains in both hips and knees.Additionally, Stryker has a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Its significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped the company stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Stryker’s portfolio includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako robotic-arm assisted surgeries.Story continuesIn September 2021, the company’s Trauma &amp; Extremities division introduced a Citrelock Tendon Fixation Device System, which offers surgeons a differentiated design through a tendon thread featuring Citregen — a resorbable technology. Citregen, in particular, has chemical and mechanical qualities intended for orthopedic surgical applications.Per management, the company’s sustained support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In the first half of 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 7.2% of net sales, highlighting its sustained commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable pricing environment poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. On second-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the period’s average selling days were in line with second-quarter 2021. The impact from pricing was 1.4% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings per share is pegged at $9.38, suggesting growth of 3.2% from 2021.

ABMD recently announced the result of a three-year, investigator-led study of all Impella-supported patients treated at 109 hospitals in Japan. The result shows a significant 30-day survival rate (77%) for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle often resulting from a viral infection).The recent study, announced at the 2022 Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference in Boston, is an update to a 2020 interim analysis. The analysis studied 143 consecutive patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis who received Impella support or Impella plus VA ECMO support, known as ECpella.In August 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for left-sided Impella heart pumps to provide left ventricular unloading and support to COVID-19 patients undergoing ECMO treatment and developing pulmonary edema or myocarditis.The latest multi-center, multi-society study of Impella-supported patients is a significant stepping stone for Abiomed’s coronary business across the world.Significance of the ResultPer the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report, the rate of occurrence of myocarditis has increased since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also disclosed that patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing myocarditis, unlike patients who did not have COVID-19.Per the lead investigator of the recent study conducted in Japan, the findings further validate the potential of increasing native heart recovery in myocarditis patients via Impella, which is an important consideration given the limited number of heart transplants.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets, the global heart pump device market is anticipated to reach $5.5 billion by 2026 from $2.1 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 21.6%. Factors like the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and long waiting periods for heart transplants are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest regulatory approvals are likely to provide a significant boost to Abiomed’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsAbiomed, this month, announced the results of a three-year, investigator-led study of all Impella-supported patients treated at 109 hospitals in Japan. The study results, which are an update to a 2020 interim analysis, show 30-day survival rates of 81% for acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock (AMICS) patients.The same month, Abiomed announced the results of a new per-protocol analysis of the ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Door-To-Unload pilot trial data. It shows significantly reduced infarct size in patients who received left ventricular (LV) unloading with Impella CP for 30 minutes prior to their PCI, unlike patients who received LV unloading followed by immediate PCI.In September, Abiomed announced the receipt of two approvals from the FDA, which are related to clinical research of Impella heart pumps in AMICS patients. The first approval is for the on-label RECOVER IV randomized controlled trial for AMICS patients, while the second was for the RECOVER III post-approval study.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. A robust second-quarter 2022 performance, along with strength in its Sequel system, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and production bottlenecks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 78.6% compared with the 34.5% decline of the industry and 13.6% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $1.31 billion. The company projects 6.6% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s projected sales growth of 8.4% is favorable to the industry’s 5.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The company, in May, announced a collaboration with genome analysis company iLAC, Inc. and Robotic Biology Institute, Inc. to develop fully automated end-to-end workflows for PacBio’s Sequel II and Sequel IIe HiFi long-read sequencing systems by employing advanced robotics.In April, PacBio announced an expanded research collaboration with Children’s Mercy Kansas City to use the multi-omics capabilities of the company’s Sequel IIe system in the study of genetic disease.Strength in Sequel System: We are optimistic about PacBio's flagship platform, the Sequel system, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. The Sequel System has been a significant contributor to Pacific Bioscience’s top line.During the second-quarter earnings call in August, PacBio confirmed that about one-third of its Sequel IIe placements were new PacBio instrument customers across all of its target markets. This demonstrates that the company continues to grow despite various challenges.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: PacBio’s robust increases in its overall top line and both its Product, and Service and other revenues in second-quarter 2022 are impressive. The company also gained from strength in its Instrument and Consumables revenues during the reported quarter. The solid performance in the Americas is also promising. The expansion of adjusted gross margin also bodes well for PacBio.DownsidesProduction Bottlenecks: PacBio must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions, including the Single Molecule, Real-Time Cell 8M and Sequel II/IIe Systems. However, the company may incur significant costs during these transitions, which may not result in the anticipated benefits.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market where its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2022. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.38 to $1.37.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $35.3 million, suggesting an 1.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 19.5% in the same time frame.ISRG — with a market capitalization of $73.66 billion — designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system and related instruments and accessories. The da Vinci surgical system is an advanced robot-assisted surgical system. The company anticipates earnings to improve 9.5% over the next five years. It beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed and matched once, the average surprise being 1.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring the Stock?Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces risks associated with open surgery. The company continues to gain from this system, which in turn bolsters overall performance.Intuitive Surgical had 7,135 da Vinci surgical systems by the end of the second quarter of 2022, with the installed base rising 12.6% year over year. For 2022, the company projects procedure growth of 12-16%. This estimate takes into account the uncertainty related to the pandemic.With respect to digital capabilities, the company remains focused on improving the ecosystem. On second-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the My Intuitive app community continued to increase on a year-over-year basis. The app is available in the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Ireland and Switzerland. The app enables surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand)Intuitive Surgical’s teams in Israel and the United States have developed Intuitive Hub on the back of its Orpheus technology. Intuitive Hub — unified hardware and software solution for the operating room — allows OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and partner virtually by utilizing existing workflows and intuitive systems. In the first quarter, the company introduced an upgraded interface to the da Vinci systems, enabling automated video capture with integrated procedure annotation for key events and building convenient video storage and review for event cases.Story continuesThe FDA clearance earlier this year for integrating mobile cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging technology with its minimally-invasive, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy system, Ion Endoluminal System, is likely to benefit the company. The technology would allow biopsy of small and difficult-to-access lesions in the lung as well as biopsy of peripheral lung and provide the necessary stability for precision in a biopsy.In the second quarter of 2022, outside the United States, revenues totaled $511 million, up 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by substantial growth in procedure volume. Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the prior-year quarter. Of these, 78 were in Europe, 18 in Japan and 15 in China.What’s Weighing on the Company?The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the global supply of semiconductors and other materials utilized in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company has been making every effort to secure the supply required to fulfill consumer demand, global shortages might result in higher output costs or delay in production.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $6.2 billion, suggesting growth of 8.6% from the year-ago reported number, while the same for earnings stands at $4.56 per share, indicating a decline of 8.1%.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

It's in my family's blood. We have an aligned vision of really pushing boundaries and in the hotel industry. We are reaching levels that we've never seen before, even pre-COVID.[MUSIC PLAYING]ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Sonia Cheng, CEO of the Rosewood Hotel Group. Sonia, nice to see you.SONIA CHENG: Nice to see you, Andy.ANDY SERWER: Thanks so much for joining us from Hong Kong. You have a really fascinating job and just an incredible hotel company with incredible properties, such as the Hotel de Crillon, The Carlyle in New York, Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, Little Dix, Silicon Valley and Sand Hill Road, all those properties. Having said that, there are other luxury brand hotels out there as well, and I'm wondering what you think really differentiates Rosewood versus some of those other luxury names?SONIA CHENG: So Rosewood, what's so special about Rosewood is it's a sense of place philosophy. So globally, we operate 30 properties around the world and every property has its own personality. Its philosophy is to celebrate local culture, its history, really bringing in that sense of place into the hotel so that all our travelers that come to the hotel can experience the beauty of that city. And so every property is carefully curated, really personalized, and really, it's a very special collection. So it's not, I wouldn't call it a chain, it's really a very special collection of beautiful hotels and landmark properties around the world.ANDY SERWER: Given that each one of the properties is so differentiated, Sonia, how do you oversee such a diverse group a portfolio like this?Story continuesSONIA CHENG: Well, first of all, we have an amazing team. They are around the world. They're very talented, very passionate in the hospitality businesses, very creative, and we have an aligned vision of really pushing boundaries in the hotel industry. So we take a very thoughtful approach every time we open a hotel.And we studied the market, we understand what the consumers are looking for each market, and we're very involved from the beginning of the design process, understanding what our target audience are looking for, curating every experience from culinary to wellness to the guest experience in the room. And also it's important for us to be immersed in that culture and to bring in those cultural experiences in every touchpoint and throughout the journey. So we don't open that many hotels every year. We carefully select the properties to make sure that every property is really special and certainly a landmark for that destination.ANDY SERWER: How many properties do you have right now and how many are you planning to open up, say, over the next 12 months? And what is that trajectory like versus before COVID? And we'll talk about COVID, of course, in particular, but just where does the business stand versus, say, 2019?SONIA CHENG: So for the Rosewood brand, we operate 30 hotels around the world in 18 countries. And we've announced 24 projects that are in the pipeline at the moment. And surprisingly, while COVID has a significant impact on the hospitality industry, we have experienced tremendous growth in our pipeline in the last two years. Developers and owners in the hospitality space continue to be quite confident in the outlook of the hotel industry and continue to invest in hotels and looking to partner with Rosewood in developing more Rosewoods around the world. So actually, the last two years, we have record high signings of new hotels in the pipeline.ANDY SERWER: So take me back to March of 2020, though, and as the pandemic unfolded, how did you respond and how did you guys survive over, say, those two critical years?SONIA CHENG: So it was certainly a very challenging time. I think it was an unprecedented time for all of us in the hotel industry. We did not prepare for it. And so we reacted very quickly.The key to addressing this crisis is to be very flexible. We immediately take care of our associates, number one. Number two, we address key concerns of our consumers, our guests, and took a very flexible approach in the hotel to make sure that all the health and hygiene standards are there. We take into considerations what our guests are looking for to ensure that it is a safe and an exclusive environment that they feel safe to stay in.And also, we react very quickly in terms of different markets and market needs. So for example, Rosewood Hong Kong, we pivoted very quickly, the business to staycation. So we were the first hotel in Hong Kong to launch a staycation program, because everyone in Hong Kong couldn't travel abroad. So we basically turned the hotel into an urban resort where we launched kids program, a summer program where the local residents can use our hotel as a vacation spot, and that was really successful.And then we was an industry leader in implementing staycation. As well, we noticed during COVID, the trend of consumers looking for more privacy, exclusivity. So there's an uptick in staying in bigger villas. We developed much more curated and personalized experience in our residences and our villas. So I think the key is we maintain significant and constant communication with our team around the world so that we're able to address concerns of our associates and the organization as well as the consumers very quickly.ANDY SERWER: So I imagine you took some of those learnings and you actually kept going with those things, right? Has that been the case?SONIA CHENG: Absolutely. So I think over COVID, the revelation is that some of the consumers' behavior has changed. They are more focused on personalized experience, number one, they care about their own well-being, they care about lifestyle, they love to travel, they miss travel, so there's a significant pent up demand, and it also allows us to discover a new territory of, how do we bring Rosewood to their home? So we actually ramped up our digital transformation.We are developing, we are pivoting our strategy of developing Rosewood to be beyond just a luxury hotel leader, but we want it to be a comprehensive lifestyle leader, where we are diversifying our portfolio. We launched Asaya during that time, a complete holistic wellness concept that really takes care of our consumers, not just in a traditional hotel spa. We launched our private membership concept in Hong Kong called Carlyle &amp; Co. where it gives a safe space, an exclusive space for private members.We also ramp up our offerings and our development on Rosewood Residences. So 50% of our Rosewood portfolio has Rosewood Residences. And then finally, we also piloted our retail offering, so really extending our Rosewood ecosystem where we can impact people's lives and give them a curated Rosewood experience wherever they are.ANDY SERWER: Wow, that's a lot of stuff. I mean, you probably never would have done those things, all those things, certainly not in that time period, had it not been for COVID, right?SONIA CHENG: I think that COVID gave us time to take a step back and pause and observe how consumers are behaving and how they're evolving and it accelerated some of the plans that are going to stay.ANDY SERWER: Yeah. So yours is a family business. Your grandfather was the patriarch of the family company, and your father, and then you joined after college then working on Wall Street.Tell us about that journey. You went to school high school in the United States, then you went to Harvard, and then, as I said, after Wall Street joined. What was that process like?SONIA CHENG: It was amazing. So after I graduated from Harvard, I went into the finance industry, which I did a few years in investment banking and then a few years at private equity. And those experience was amazing. It gave me a very solid foundation in terms of how to analyze operating companies, build the financial skills that I need in the future.And then after I think about five years, then I started venturing into the hospitality business. Hospitality has always been my passion. It's in our family blood, as you mention. My grandfather and my father were pioneers in the luxury hotel space in Asia.They were the first one to develop the first luxury hotel in Hong Kong. They were the first one to develop the first luxury hotel in China. At one point, with the New World Hotels, we were one of the biggest player in Asia at that time. And my grandfather and my father always loved the hospitality business and I've always been growing up surrounded by the hotel business. We lived next door to the hotel.I used to go with my father when he was looking after the hotel business to look at operations. I traveled around the world with them. So that's how I developed my passion. And so after the finance experience, I immediately ventured into the hotel business.ANDY SERWER: And so you had some background in it, but basically, you were learning as you were going initially and then when did you take the reins of the business itself?SONIA CHENG: So I joined in 2008, around 2008, 2009. And you're correct, I didn't have the traditional hotel education. I didn't go to Hotel School. But because when I joined, I was so passionate that I spent the first two years really almost a crash course in hotels, meeting as many people as possible in the hotel industry, different companies, talking to a lot of from market leaders, to influencers, to travel experts to really understand, what are the needs in the hotel industry?What are the offerings and what are the white space? And then those first two years, the other thing I did was I knew that I need a very strong management team. So I spent the first two years hiring and recruiting the best talents to join my team to be partners on our exciting journey. And then fast forward in 2011, the key pivotal point was the acquisition of Rosewood in 2011.ANDY SERWER: Right. How does your family, do you guys have family meetings where you talk about all the businesses together? How does your family operate that way?SONIA CHENG: Actually, we're pretty casual. My father is a great mentor. He really loves the hotel business. So every time we have family dinners, he will discuss with me on hotel operations, give me advice, share with me his observation whenever he goes around to the hotels, and we would have really open discussion and discuss how we can improve, how we can involve, and how do we develop the brand.ANDY SERWER: Right. And then you have brothers who are in other businesses that are part of the family group as well, right?SONIA CHENG: That's correct.ANDY SERWER: So tell us what's going on a little bit in Hong Kong, Sonia, in terms of the business environment. We read so much here in the United States about changes and disruption, COVID, political issues. How would you describe the environment right now?SONIA CHENG: Well, Hong Kong recently relaxed their travel restrictions, coming to Hong Kong on the quarantine, so that's really good news. We're already seeing an uptick in travel coming into Hong Kong once the restriction was lifted. I'm very confident that once the quarantine restrictions are lifted completely, there will be a very quick recovery in Hong Kong.I think there's a significant pent up demand in coming to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is still the one of the world's most important financial hub, business hub, cultural hub. And we're very confident in terms of Hong Kong's future and outlook and hopefully the restrictions will relax very soon and we'll see a very significant recovery.ANDY SERWER: And just one more question along those lines. I mean, running a global business like this, are you concerned about the way the world seems to be going in terms of being anti-globalists, and the world being more divided up, and travel being more difficult between countries because of political tensions, not just COVID? Is that something you consider?SONIA CHENG: I think now, in a line of business as I see with the recovery of COVID, we see a significant pent up demand to travel. If you look at the recovery path, whether it is in China, whether it's in Europe and the US, the trend is the same. As soon as restrictions are lifted, people want to go back to what was their normal lives period pre-COVID.They want to see their family, they want to see their friends, they want to meet their colleagues. So what we're experiencing in our hotels are a very quick recovery. Whether it's in the US or Europe, and now Southeast Asia, we are reaching levels that we've never seen before even pre-COVID. So overall, I'm very confident in the hospitality space and its outlook.ANDY SERWER: Right. And so just to follow up on that, are you kind of back to 2019 levels?SONIA CHENG: Oh, some of the hotels are beyond 2019 levels. We have resorts in Mexico that it's experiencing rates and occupancy that they have never seen before since opening. So there's a huge pent up demand.ANDY SERWER: Now, on the other hand, part of the problems with this demand are twofold. One, which is labor shortages, and two, supply chain so. I'd like to ask you about both of those things.And I know it may be hard to generalize about both, since you are such a global business. But what about, let's just take them one at a time, what about labor shortages? How is that playing out in various markets, Sonia?SONIA CHENG: So, we are experiencing labor challenges, I think as with everyone else in the hotel space and travel industry. However, in the last couple of months, we've been able to recruit the talent that we have been looking for. I think that it's very important to reintroduce the beauty of the hotel industry to the talents out there. I think that because of COVID, they temporarily left the industry, but a lot actually wanted to come back.So I think it's important to focus on building an organization where we are communicating to our talents that this is a learning organization. What is your career path? Focusing on building a purpose-led organization, which the new generation of talents, that's what they're looking for.So really shifting focus on, how do we make the hospitality industry attractive again? And it all comes down to people. It all comes down to leadership and what are you trying to build as an organization? And we've been seeing some success. We had a little bit of a bump last couple years, but then we've seen some success in recruiting back the talents.ANDY SERWER: And as far as supply chain goes, how is that affecting your business, just in terms of being able to source everything, from food to linens to construction materials? And is that impacting pricing? And are you seeing inflation being a problem?SONIA CHENG: So we're starting to seeing some rise in cost in our properties and our hotel operations in the US and Europe and we are addressing it. I think that we are looking at different methods of optimizing our operations. The good thing is, because the pent up demand of travel is there, and we're seeing such a surge of travel and rates are increasing as well, so overall, the impact currently is still manageable.ANDY SERWER: Right. So you have some pricing flexibility in terms of what you're able to charge. Shifting gears a little bit, Sonia, I want to ask you about being a woman leader in the business and what that's been like, and how singular that is and what your experience has been.SONIA CHENG: I think that, for Rosewood, I think women in the hospitality industry, we can offer a very unique perspective to the hospitality industry. And I can speak for myself, I'm a mother of four at the moment and I find it a very tremendous experience to be in the hotel industry, because previously, you were saying that there's challenges of work and family balance. And but what I realize is nowadays, a lot of women travel with their family on vacation. There's a trend of developing blending work with leisure at the same time.And for us women, we have a different lens in the hotel industry where we can shed a different light that can help evolve the experience in hotels. So for example, because I have four children and I know what is important to children, the last couple of years we revamped our children's program, which is called Rose Explorer. So previously, in different hotels, kids clubs are seen as this 50 square meter room where you have some art table, you have some books and that's the kids club to house the children in resorts. But because I have children, I have a different perspective.And Rosewood Phuket, for example, we've launched a new kids program where we built in a lot more educational experience from programs to learn about coral reef, to a herb garden. So they learn about organic planting, to tie weaving stations. So it's a very diverse education experience and kids love it and families are going to Rosewood because we have an amazing kids program. And I wouldn't have developed that had I not become a mother.So I think women can really provide a different perspective to the industry. The other example I want to give you is about development of Asaya. And when we launched the Asaya concept, we created a focus group with a lot of women and talked to them about what their needs are and what they're looking for that is beyond a traditional spa. So those inspirations are very important and critical for our hotel industry to continue to develop and continue to evolve our concept.ANDY SERWER: That's fascinating. I think you're also using data analytics to personalize hotel stays more and more. Can you talk to us about where that's going?SONIA CHENG: Yeah, so I think it's very important that we recognize our consumers' behavior, our guests' behavior on a regular basis. So we are building a very strong CRM program globally for our hotels where we are able to understand our customer's need in advance, and so that our approach and our service approach is much more intuitive. We're building a data lake where we are capturing these data and allowing our associates at the property to provide those experience in a much more personal way.ANDY SERWER: And what about sustainability? Is that important to you and how has that manifested both from an operational standpoint, Sonia, and also maybe from the standpoint of something that the guests might experience?SONIA CHENG: Yes, absolutely. So sustainability is very important to us. We have just launched our social impact vision, in fact, which is called Rosewood Impact. And the vision really covers how we are going to support community, as well as play our part in protecting the planet.And we have been doing a lot of sustainability efforts and initiatives and programs for decades now. We have a global food waste program where we try to reduce wastage, as well as reduce energy around the world. And then we have just opened Rosa Sao Paulo for example, which is one of the largest upcycling project in Brazil, in fact.And we're committed to, within a year, to achieve 100% renewable energy through solar panels and hopefully to achieve, as a group, carbon neutrality in the future. So sustainability is very much a core pillar in our organization. We've been doing a lot, but we recognize that we need to do more to help sustain and protect the planet.ANDY SERWER: And you just mentioned Sao Paulo. Can you tell us where you're going to be opening other properties over the next year?SONIA CHENG: So beyond Brazil, you mean?ANDY SERWER: Yes. Yeah.SONIA CHENG: Yes, absolutely. So for Rosewood the brand, I mean, we've announced about 24 projects around the world. Next year is a very exciting year for us. We're opening quite a few amazing projects.We're opening a Rosewood Amsterdam. We're opening in Rosewood Munich. We're opening our first hotel in Hawaii, Kona Village. We're also venturing into Middle East and opening Rosewood Doha as well. So very exciting openings in the next year.ANDY SERWER: Sounds like you're going to be racking up those frequent flyer miles, Sonia, right?SONIA CHENG: Yes, hopefully. I think next year onwards the travel will be quite intense.ANDY SERWER: All right, final question, and I know you're not going to be able to answer this because this is like the same thing, me asking you which one of your kids is your favorite kid. So I'm going to ask you, which one of your hotel properties is your favorite property? Or is there any way that you can maybe say, well, something really sticks out in your mind that you kind of really dig?SONIA CHENG: I mean, a lot of people ask me that question and I will give the same answer. I really do not have a favorite. Every Rosewood property really have a special place in my heart. Everyone has their own story. From Rosewood Hong Kong, which is my home, my home city. I used to live in that area, so it has a special place in my heart. To Rosewood Beijing, which is our first hotel in Asia. To a Hotel de Crillon in Paris, which is a tremendous landmark in Paris. And so every property really has an amazing spot in my heart, so I can't really say who's the favorite.ANDY SERWER: You have the dozens of hotels and the four kids and you love them all. I can't blame. You can't single any of them out. That makes sense, right?SONIA CHENG: Exactly.ANDY SERWER: Sonia Cheng, CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group. Thank you so much for your time.SONIA CHENG: Thank you, Andy. Thank you.ANDY SERWER: You've been watching ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. We'll see you next time.[AUDIO LOGO]]"

Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. However, high operating expenses are hurting Wabtec’s bottom line.Factors Favoring WABWabtec’s acquisition of Collins Aerospace’s ARINC rail solutions business segment in June 2022 is expected to drive growth. The transaction expands its digital and electronics portfolio, and enhances productivity, safety and efficiency across itsglobal rail network.The acquisition helps Wabtec expand across the United States and Canada, and offer support for transit, regional, inter-city, commuter, subway and light rail systems through ARINC’s rail solutions business. Additionally, WAB’s acquisition of Nordco in 2021 helped it widen its installed base, and facilitate domestic and international growth across the latter’s innovative product portfolio.In January 2022, Wabtec acquired the railway friction business ofIndia-based MASU for approximately $34 million. The buyout strengthens WAB’s installed base and expands its brake product portfolio. The series of acquisitions isexpected to boost the acquirer’s top line.Wabtec’s cash position is impressive too. WAB exited the second quarter of 2022 with cash and equivalents of $501 million, above the current debt of $226 million.

(NYSE: CMI) is showcasing its platform of zero-emissions technologies this week at the IAA Transportation show, the world's largest mobility show, in Hannover, Germany. A range of new Cummins technologies and the recently acquired Meritor ePowertrain technologies are available publicly together for the first time. With over a century of experience as a global power leader, Cummins is solidifying its commitment to providing comprehensive zero-emissions technology on a global scale.""Cummins has deep application expertise, and we are uniquely positioned to deliver solutions that truly fit the needs of commercial applications,"" said Amy Davis, Vice President and President of New Power at Cummins. ""Realizing a net-zero future will require a range of technologies. Our extensive zero-emissions portfolio is how we will meet varied customer demands across the hardest-to-abate industries and make the energy transition possible.""One key zero-emissions product Cummins revealed at IAA is its fourth-generation hydrogen fuel cell engine. Designed to meet the duty-cycle, performance and packaging requirements of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses, the fuel cell technology is available in 135 kW single and 270 kW dual modules.Scania in Europe and Daimler Trucks North America have each announced collaborations with Cummins to develop and integrate these next-generation fuel cell engines into demonstrator vehicles. The systems use fourth-generation variable pressure technology to provide higher power density, power nodes and operating temperatures for easier system integration into vehicles. They also have strong operating cycle efficiency and durability for a lower total cost of ownership.""We know our customers have diverse needs and complicated duty cycles to support, which is why we focus on continued innovation and improvement,"" said Amy Adams, Vice President of Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies at Cummins. ""We’re developing hydrogen fuel cell technology that demonstrates the capacity and flexibility required to meet or exceed the power needs for on-highway commercial vehicles – proving hydrogen as a viable solution to decarbonize the economy.""Story continuesAttendees at IAA will also get the first glimpse of a drivetrain assembled with a newly introduced Cummins lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack, Meritor’s 17xe ePowertrain and Meritor’s Power Control and Accessory System (PCAS).

The ePowertrain leverages market-leading technologies in the axle, motor and inverter, delivering performance, efficiency and packaging advantages at a competitive cost. Additionally, the PCAS provides power where needed and control of necessary sub-systems while reducing packaging size and simplifying integration.Cummins is adding an LFP battery to its line of lithium-ion battery products to expand support of electrified commercial vehicle applications. The LFP solution gives customers access to faster charging and longer-life batteries, targeting the medium-duty truck and school bus markets. By using a multi-chemistry strategy, Cummins is positioned to expand its manufacturing capacity further and diversify its supply chain, providing customers with more cost-effective electrification solutions.""We are giving customers options to enable them to adapt to a zero-emissions future faster,"" said Brian Wilson, General Manager of Electrified Components at Cummins. ""With the recent acquisition of Meritor and our new multi-chemistry approach, we will be able to tailor our solutions and offer a one-stop-shop for customers' powertrain needs.""Cummins' portfolio includes four batteries, each of which targets a different duty cycle and use case and complement each other. In addition to the LFP option, this includes three nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries – the BP95E, BP74E and BP30E. The BP95E is Cummins’ next-generation solution that prioritizes greater energy density in applications for customers who need more weight-sensitive solutions or have longer ranges.

The cities included in the mobile grocery effort are Indianapolis, Indiana; Jamestown, New York; Charleston, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Rocky Mount, North Carolina.The United States is one of the richest nations in the world, yet about 10.5%, or 13.8 million Americans experience food insecurity, which is the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), about 19 million Americans or 33% live in a food desert, which the USDA defines as living more than one mile away from a supermarket for urban areas, or greater than 10 miles for rural areas.In communities of color and low-income areas, many residents don’t have cars, and in many cases lack reliable public transportation. Additionally, while many urban communities have small neighborhood stores within a reasonable distance, residents pay up to 37% more than suburban communities where residents have access to larger supermarkets.A mobile grocery provides healthy food options by modifying school buses, city buses, large vans, trucks, and more to house healthy food options and transport them to needed neighborhoods. Mobile grocery markets are often run by local organizations, which circulate revenue within the local economy and can serve as a catalyst for other businesses and investments in the neighborhoods. The mobility allows outreach to multiple neighborhoods and can be more effective than storefronts.Story continuesWithin the six CARE communities, Cummins’ Community Involvement Teams known within the company as CITs will work closely with local partners to support mobile grocery efforts and drive impact.In 2020, Cummins introduced Cummins Advocating for Racial Equity. CARE is working in four specific areas: police reform, criminal justice reform, economic empowerment, and social justice reform. Cummins is committed to the kind of long-term approach necessary to effectively address issues like institutional racism and systemic inequity.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/cummins-grants-to-help-create-mobile-grocery-markets-to-counter-food-deserts-667330630]"

(NYSE:DIS) are down 32% so far this year. The stock is now trading near the March 2020 level, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused global economic disruption. The launch of Disney+ a year before the pandemic helped the stock gain traction despite mobility restrictions drying out its theme park business in 2020 as the company reported strong growth from its streaming business. The current economic slowdown, however, has raised concerns about the growth of the streaming business, and these concerns have pushed Disney stock lower along with broad market turbulence.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISGurus Love Disney Despite Short-Term ChallengesMany investors are currently pessimistic about stocks in general, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 21% in the first half of 2022. Although the market appears to be recovering slightly, investors remain concerned about economic uncertainty caused by rising interest rates, high inflation, geopolitical conflicts and the possibility of a recession.These factors, combined with Disney's disappointing second-quarter financial results, have made it difficult for the stock to recover in recent months. Inflation is likely to eat into consumers' purchasing power, affecting both streaming subscriptions and the theme park business. Despite these concerns, many gurus, including Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio), Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) and David Tepper (Trades, Portfolio), bought the stock during the second quarter in a vote of confidence for what the future holds for the company.Disney+ continues to add subscribers, but at a slower paceDisney is a well-diversified entertainment company. The mobility restrictions and other pandemic-related safety measures wreaked havoc on its theme park business, but also boosted its streaming service, Disney+, which surpassed 100 million subscribers within a year of its launch. Despite fierce competition among major streaming media companies, the entertainment giant reported higher-than-expected growth in streaming subscribers across all of its media platforms.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter, the company reported 221 million subscribers across all of its direct-to-consumer services, including 14.4 million new Disney+ subscribers, bringing the total subscriber count to 152.1 million. Disney's direct-to-consumer segment lost $1.06 billion at the operating level, a significant increase from the year-ago quarter's loss of $293 million.In the coming quarters, paid subscriber additions could slow down with inflation wreaking havoc on consumers' wallets, but the expected launch of the ad-supported content tier on Dec. 8 may help the company accelerate subscriber additions once again.Disney+ global subscriber count by quarterGurus Love Disney Despite Short-Term ChallengesSource: StatistaLast year, Disney films received 23 Oscar nominations, with ""Encanto"" winning the award for the best animated feature. This year, however, the story appears to be different. The theatrical release of ""Lightyear,"" the prequel to the animated classic ""Toy Story,"" was met with mixed reviews. The film only made about $156 million through late June, falling short of its $200 million budget. In August, it added a slew of Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars content, which might have helped the company boost subscriber growth. The company intends to release 180 original titles before the fiscal year ends.Disneys content production costs have increased along with the growing importance of the streaming business, which is something investors need to take into account as they could lead to a margin contraction in the future.The recovering travel sector is driving growth, but risks are looming on the horizonDisney's core business segment - parks, experiences and products - rebounded strongly in early 2022 with revenue more than doubling to $6.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter. The theme parks segment then reported $2.18 billion in revenue fore the fiscal third quarter against revenue of just $356 million in the prior-year quarter.Despite the temporary closure of Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland due to local Covid spikes, the company saw an increase in attendance, hotel bookings, cruise ship sailings and food, beverage and merchandise spending. With the reopening of the Shanghai park and the maiden voyage of its newest cruise ship, The Disney Wish, the company is expected to report strong growth in this segment in the current quarter as well.Despite the return of international travelers, the company said they still accounted for less than the levels seen before the pandemic in recent quarters. Investors should not overlook the impact of rising costs, which are already having an impact on its direct-to-consumer business. It would be even worse if there was a drop in customer spending just as the parks are getting back on track. In the current economic climate, it is risky to predict that more people will spend money on theme parks and cruises in the coming months.TakeawayDisney is currently valued at a significant discount to its March 2021 highs. The biggest challenges the company faces today are short-term in nature, which could be one of the factors behind the recent glut in guru investments. The long-term prospects for both Disneys streaming business and its theme parks are promising. The entertainment giant is more attractively valued today due to the strong comeback in the parks segment.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NYSE:DIS) has always been a leader in the entertainment industry. It is now working comprehensively on a digital strategy that will help power the future of storytelling.The media and entertainment giant has been investing in technology for many years, and its current focus is on creating new experiences that are interactive, immersive and customized. Disney is also using data to create more targeted content across its digital platforms. The company is committed to creating the best possible experience for its audiences, and its digital strategy will help it continue to be a leader in the entertainment industry.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISCEO Bob Chapek has said he wants to use the latest trends in technology to ensure Disney offers services no one else can. For instance, ge wants to use data from theme park visits and consumers' streaming habits to deliver personalized entertainment experiences.The most recent sign that Disney is looking to shake things up in the industry came when it appointed veteran media and tech executive Mike White, who has an accomplished track record, as head of the newly created Next Generation Storytelling unit. In this new position, White will be responsible for exploring all forms of future storytelling opportunities across multiple platforms.In recent years, the focus on data gathering and augmented reality, as well as new forms of entertainment, has fed into Disney's existing product lines, most importantly Disney+. It has emerged as one of the world's strongest streaming companies, largely due to the company's commitment to innovation. By continuing to invest in new technology and ideas, Disney is ensuring that its product will remain at the forefront of the entertainment industry for years to come.Disney lays out an aggressive plan for a digital futureThe Covid-19 pandemic dealt a heavy blow to Disney, but the company responded by adapting its businesses to the new normal. In particular, its streaming service became a big hit with families as the pandemic forced everyone to spend more time indoors. Disney+ is now the biggest streaming service provider in the world, beating out Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) with 221.1 million streaming subscriptions worldwide across its streaming offerings as of the June 2022 quarter.Story continuesMany companies would be happy with this situation. However, this is Disney we are talking about. It is never going to be content with its performance.From its early experiments in animation to its computer-generated imagery in blockbuster films, Disney has long been at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. The company is now working hard to incorporate augmented reality into its products. It has already developed mobile apps that allow users to see virtual characters and objects in their real-world surroundings. The Next Generation Storytelling unit is part of this strategy. The company also plans to bring augmented reality to its theme parks, allowing visitors to interact with Disney characters in new and innovative ways.However, Disney+ is the biggest area these digital initiatives will impact. Even though the streaming network was incredibly popular and successful from its launch, it is still struggling to generate profits. But the sharp growth in total subscriber numbers has helped keep Disney's stock prices high despite the pandemic, inflation and supply chain issues.In addition, Disney is increasing the prices of its streaming services. The subscription for ad-free Disney+ is jumping to $10.99 per month from $7.99 per month, while Hulu's ad-free streaming monthly fee will also increase to $14.99. The ad-supported version of Hulu will increase to $7.99 per month from $6.99 per month, while the ad-supported version of Disney+ will cost $7.99 a month when it launches on Dec. 8.If the consumer base remains sticky, then Disney+ will easily become profitable. However, the key in the long run is keeping consumers on the platform. Netflix has run into this problem and is suffering from quarter-over-quarter subscriber declines for the first time in its history. Disney could avoid this situation by investing in storytelling elements and new technology. It is trying to do that now with interactive units and augmented reality. As a prime example, Disney+ released an augmented reality short film, ""Remembering,"" starring Brie Larson. This could be a promising indicator of what is to come.TakeawayDisney has always been known for its ability to stay ahead of the curve. In recent years, the company has once again taken a leading role in the field of augmented reality as its streaming service allows users to experience Disney content in a whole new way.By incorporating augmented reality into its content, Disney is able to provide an immersive and interactive experience that is unlike any other. In addition to being a leader in augmented reality, Disney+ is also one of the most successful streaming services in terms of revenue generation. With its large catalog of popular films and TV shows, it has quickly become one of the most popular streaming services available.Disney+ will continue to grow as the company invests heavily in augmented reality-based storytelling and data analysis to create custom content. So far, the substantial growth in the number of subscriptoins for the streaming service indicates the growth story is going nowhere. As more people become interested in streaming services, Disney+ is well positioned to capture a large portion of the market. The company's investment in technology and content will allow it to create unique and engaging experiences that keep subscribers coming back for more. All of this will also translate into strong returns for its investors as well.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.M&amp;T Bank Corporation in FocusBased in Buffalo, M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 21.88%. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.2 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.56%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.42% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.74%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.80 is up 6.7% from last year. M&amp;T Bank Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 9.92%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, M&amp;T Bank Corporation's payout ratio is 37%, which means it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MTB is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $15.19 per share, with earnings expected to increase 10.07% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MTB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AKAM) shareholders have seen the share price descend 11% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 75% in that time. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 23% drop, in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Akamai Technologies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price.

Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.

494,f36146d4-b987-3111-b9b2-1eb863e01740,NDAQ,2022-09-22,ESG Insights for IROs,News Direct,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/esg-insights-iros-140015674.html,1663682415,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[Northampton, MA --News Direct-- Nasdaq, Inc.Over the past several years, environmental, social and governance (ESG) has moved to the forefront of investment strategies, making it critically important for corporate investor relations (IR) teams to communicate their sustainability story through roadshows, investor meetings and annual sustainability reports.At Nasdaq, our IR team, in tandem with our Corporate ESG team, focuses on communicating our sustainability efforts. Year over year, our ESG communications reflect Nasdaq's ongoing commitment to evaluating and enhancing ESG policies, programs, and disclosures. Nasdaq has markedly improved upon its end-to-end suite of sustainability reporting solutions. Notably, MSCI, a provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community, recently recognized our continued efforts by upgrading Nasdaq’s MSCI ESG Rating from BBB to AA in July 2022.As sustainability becomes further engrained in corporate strategic initiatives, Michael Stiller, Head of ESG Advisory and Engagement at Nasdaq, spoke with Nasdaq Investor Relations Officer Ed Ditmire during a recent webinar, discussing the evolution of how ESG is impacting the role of IROs. The following is a transcript of a portion of their discussion, which has been edited for clarity.Insights from Nasdaq's Investor Relations Officer Ed DitmireMichael Stiller: Why do you think IR professionals should care about ESG? You highlight being prepared for investor meetings, but is there anything else you think is critical for ESG and the IRO?Ed Ditmire: Let me give my experience, and I will say everyone's journey and situation in IR is different. I was not someone that was just born with an ESG passion, if you said to me at any point in my time at Nasdaq, “What's your number one goal?” I would say I want investors to understand how special and high-quality Nasdaq is as a company, and for it to be seen as one of the high-quality growth stories in the market and justify the premium valuation that comes with that.Story continuesBeginning the ESG JourneyDitmire: So, at one early point on my journey as an IRO, I happened to be on a debt roadshow. We were planning on issuing Euro-denominated bonds, and we were meeting with investors in Europe as part of the deal roadshow. And at the end of one pretty well-attended meeting in Paris, a prospective investor said, ""I like your story. I think these are probably excellent bonds, but I think your ESG ratings are an issue, you should probably check in on them."" And I said, “OK, sure.” This was five years ago, and while I’m a little ashamed to admit this today, I did not at the time know that ESG rating agencies were publishing research reports on Nasdaq. I didn't know that they had been for years and that they were giving us bottom quartile scores. I asked for the reports and noticed right away that they were full of inaccuracies. The most prominent one was that [it said] one issue with Nasdaq was that it didn’t give adequate benefits to employees. And I said, why are they saying this about us? And, after figuring out how to get in contact with them, they said, well, you don't engage with us, and you don't put clear information on your website. So, I set a first goal of saying, let's make sure that they aren't incorrectly putting us in this below-average category. My original objective was, let’s try to not have the kind of problematic, below-average ESG profile, especially one built on misunderstandings, that keeps investors away from what should be a good stock story.Telling Your ESG StoryDitmire: Along the way, Nasdaq also embraced a many more, and frankly more important motivations and opportunities on ESG. We embraced the opportunity that Nasdaq can be absolutely superb at sustainability, not only in how we run ourselves the right way but, more uniquely, in how we can make an impact on the outside world. The idea is that Nasdaq can be an ESG multiplier to hundreds or thousands of companies that have opportunities to make a difference by helping them learn things more quickly, be more effective, and be more actionable. So now, in addition to being certain that Nasdaq's ESG story is not going to get in the way of any of our other investment appeals, I'm increasingly convinced that Nasdaq is appropriate for the investors that care the most about ESG and are looking for special ESG stories. If I can find an investor like that, I can say, ""Listen, I have a story to tell you that you're not going to hear from any other company. The way we think we can make a difference is going to dovetail with what you all are trying to do as investors precisely."" It's been a real evolution of what ESG is to this investor relations effort.Stiller: That was great. I remember you telling me that story from five years ago when you came out of that meeting, and you said, I’ve got to figure this out. And that program has evolved quite a bit since then. The program was largely housed out of the IR team. Then we formalized with ESG sitting in the corporate controller/CFO office. We've always had a great evangelist and thought leading head of sustainability in Evan Harvey but formalizing it a bit more was the great evolution that we've seen. There is always more work to be done. It is a journey, as you highlighted, and it's fun to see you walk that journey.Becoming an ESG ExpertStiller: Rounding us out is the IRO of the future. We've had some discussions about what you think that person looks like and what skills are needed to be effective in ESG and non-ESG-related.Ditmire: It's really interesting; the IRO is evolving quite a bit. It's, by some measures, one of the youngest departments in corporations. GE started the first IR department in the 1960s, so it's much younger, for example, than marketing departments. It probably went through a stage where it was about communications first, and it was more like other corporate communications. Then, it went through a stage where it got heavily into finance and where you found most IROs reporting to CFOs. And then I think it's broadening dramatically now; it covers a lot of ESG, and ESG seems more complicated than finance. And easily demands 30% of my time. And in that, I need reinforcements. I need people on my team that is skilled at ESG. I’ve committed to studying coursework for GRI and SASB accreditations. I think the [IR] department needs a lot of ESG skills.Ditmire: It wouldn't surprise me that the IR department of the future could include someone that's mostly focused on ESG and another person that's mostly focused on how the company thinks about where, how, and with who it’s engaging with—think of a manager for a touring rock band. And then when we get the right opportunities, i.e., telling our story to a great crowd, evaluating, how are we doing well with those opportunities? So short story, I think it's possible that we will end up with bigger and more varied IR departments in the future than we have today.Stiller: So many interesting comments there. Really interesting to hear that you're getting some of those ESG designations; that's awesome you're putting in the time and work on that front. We've seen within IR teams at bigger companies there being an ESG-dedicated person or people, and similarly with those large teams, we do see roadshow managers making sure that the concerts are fully booked.Connecting with the Investor CommunityStiller: What trends are you hearing from investors as you engage with them on ESG and Nasdaq’s story specifically?Ditmire: What resonates, number one, [is that] investors I speak to are convinced that ESG is a clear secular trend. They see the ESG secular trend as clearly as the transition to electric cars, and so there are few arguments about whether or not ESG is important. And you have to think about an IRO’s audience; they work in the investment management industry. They're extremely clear about how their own industry and their businesses are changing in response to this trend.Ditmire: The second thing is, if I'm talking to a real ESG subject matter expert, someone that's crunching ESG numbers and helping their firm in that way, they thank us. They say, ""We can't do good work if companies don't give us quality information. And so, I see what Nasdaq's doing. I see about the IR and ESG solutions. I also see things like the diversity listing rule, and I appreciate that you're helping me get quality information out of more and more companies."" They understand how hard it is to do their job when they're guessing, when they have to use sources of information which don’t feel as reliable as an issuer itself.Stiller: Thank you for your time, Ed.For more information about Nasdaq’s ESG Advisory Program, View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/esg-insights-for-iros-733011559]"

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.99bUS$3.10bUS$3.49bUS$3.80bUS$4.02bUS$4.21bUS$4.38bUS$4.52bUS$4.66bUS$4.78bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.96%Est @ 4.75%Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.9%Est @ 2.62% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$3.0kUS$3.1kUS$3.1kUS$3.1kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.8b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$144bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$144b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$85bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$115b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$75.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

JNPR recently inked an agreement with Tata Play Fiber for an undisclosed amount to augment the latter’s network capabilities to cater to the exponential growth in customers and related data demands. The improvement in infrastructure facilities is expected to reduce the complexity of the network while increasing operational flexibility and efficiency with a better economy of scale.Tata Play Fiber is one of the leading broadband service providers in India, which is reportedly the second largest Internet market globally. It aims to build a PAN India Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) broadband infrastructure to cater to the exponential growth in demand for premium, high-speed Internet connectivity across the subcontinent.This is where Juniper routing solutions come to the fore by effectively helping Tata Play Fiber to offer seamless connectivity and improve the scale and agility of its regional networks. Its 400G connections are easier to manage with fewer overall ports and deliver a lower cost-per-bit by offering the same bandwidth in less physical space. Juniper’s simplified network traffic management eradicates the complexity associated with multiple networks and delivers optimal bandwidth utilization.With the latest routing platforms, the company aims to significantly improve the network for more agile service delivery and better security features for enhanced visibility and customer data protection. This is expected to provide a shorter time-to-market for new services while ensuring regulatory compliance and data security.Segment routing simplifies operations and reduces resource requirements in the network by removing network state information from intermediate routers and placing path information into packet headers at the ingress node. This improves operational flexibility and agility for cost-effective user experiences as fewer network elements are involved, avoiding slow response to sudden network changes.In addition, Tata Play Fiber is likely to leverage Juniper's Broadband Network Gateway subscriber management solution to simplify the delivery of bundled services. This will help to automate service delivery and provide quick home installation and troubleshooting, improving customer service and enabling quicker access to premium, superfast broadband connectivity to millions across India.Juniper is set to capitalize on the growing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence. The company is offering new suites of products, such as the T4000 core router, QFX data center platform, ACX and PTX packet/optical solution, among others. With the growing use of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has gone up. This has resulted in higher demand for advanced networking architecture, leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches. Juniper is expected to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks to support incremental growth in data traffic.Despite short-term challenges, particularly within the cloud and service provider verticals, Juniper expects healthy progress in most areas of its business, which augurs well for its long-term growth. The company has made significant changes to its go-to-market structure to better align its sales strategies with each of its core customer verticals. Moreover, several new products are in the pipeline, which are expected to further strengthen its competitive position across service provider, cloud and enterprise markets.The stock has lost 3.2% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 11.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 42%. That's well below the market decline of 19%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 29% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.After losing 5.1% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Even though the Comcast share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Comcast managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthComcast is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Comcast in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Comcast shareholders are down 40% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 19%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.2% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Comcast better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Comcast .Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

511,3913ef67-a77b-3bc1-b304-87711e7a88f4,DVN,2022-09-22,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-attracting-130001950.html,1663765201,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 1.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +106.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +161.8%. This estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.54 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +41.4%. The $19.85 billion and $20.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +66.5% and +1.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +132.8%. EPS of $2.59 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +17.26%. The EPS surprise was +8.82%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The economic pain of coronavirus has been felt for the first time this year as the U.S. government has stopped its fiscal stimulus and the Fed has turned ultra-hawkish from ultra-dovish in its monetary policies.Mounting Inflation and Rigorous Rate HikeInflation remains at a 40-year high despite an increase in the Fed Fund rate from almost zero to 2.5% from March to July. A large section of economists and financial experts were expecting a decline in inflation in August due to a significant drop in energy prices and travel costs. However, food, shelter (housing and home building), vehicles and medical services drove costs higher in August.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and various other top Fed officials with voting rights have indicated that the rigorous rate hike will continue until inflation is at least down close to the Fed’s 2% target rate.After August’s CPI data, market participants are expecting another 75 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate in the September FOMC of the Fed is a foregone conclusion. Some investment analysts are also expecting a 1% rate hike this month.

KeyBank provides deposit, lending, cash management, and investment services to individuals and businesses in 15 states through a network of 1,000 branches. With Oracle Banking Originations, the bank can now service loan accounts in real-time from the initial application through to payments and collections, helping eliminate delays, and improve customer service.Oracle Logo (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""At KeyBank, we understand you cannot 'kick the can' on modernizing legacy banking systems if you wish to remain competitive, foster innovation, and maintain operating costs,"" said Kim Snipes, KeyBank's, CIO of Consumer and Digital. ""Financial institutions must implement modern, modular API-driven real-time systems. Oracle provided the foundation we needed to accelerate our digital transformation efforts across our consumer-facing digital channels and key enterprise operations. With Oracle, we were able to successfully move an active banking portfolio to a new system without interruptions to our customers.""KeyBank has worked closely with Oracle since the launch of its consumer digital banking platform in 2017. Since then, it has expanded its digital servicing capabilities into originations using Oracle Banking technology, which provides the orchestration and modern underwriting workflow needed to support real-time decisioning for consumer deposit and credit card accounts. With that enhancement, KeyBank customers are now able to open a checking, savings, or credit card account in as little as five minutes. To bring this modern digital experience to more product areas, KeyBank recently expanded its use of Oracle to include its non-real estate loan servicing and collections.Story continuesKeyBank's legacy non-real estate loan system was difficult to maintain and relied on manual processes, putting a strain on its back-end operations. After acquiring First Niagara Bank in 2015, KeyBank needed a way to bring together the two firms' different loan servicing, collections, and recovery systems. To address that challenge, KeyBank and Oracle worked together to implement the Oracle Banking Originations and its supporting applications for non-real estate servicing and collections while addressing stringent US regulations.KeyBank's real-time loan servicing capabilities now provide complete, straight-through processing and integrated workflows that help reduce operating costs. Oracle's modern user interface streamlines the back-office experience and the shift from batch processing to real-time data processing helps ensure the collections team is not contacting a customer who may have recently completed a payment.""Oracle and KeyBank have a long history working together to evolve KeyBank's technology to address their growing business needs,"" said Sonny Singh, executive vice president and general manager, Oracle Financial Services. ""KeyBank is a proven frontrunner in its commitment to transform its legacy systems into modern digital solutions delivering more self-service capabilities for its customers. Our new loan servicing solution operates in real-time and replaces the old way of offering and managing loans, such as outdated manual processes, with customized offers and instant, digital payments.""In addition to originations, KeyBank has leveraged Oracle technology to launch new digital capabilities in the wake of the pandemic and build its national digital bank tailored to physicians and dentists, Laurel Road for Doctors.Learn more about KeyBank's story here.About KeyCorp KeyCorp's roots trace back nearly 200 years to Albany, New York.

Java 19 (Oracle JDK 19) delivers thousands of performance, stability, and security improvements, including enhancements to the platform that will help developers improve productivity and drive business-wide innovation. Oracle will showcase the latest capabilities in Java 19 at JavaOne 2022, taking place October 17-20 in Las Vegas, and via a keynote broadcast airing on dev.java/ at 9:00 a.m. PT on Tuesday, September 20.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Our ongoing collaboration with the developer community is the lifeblood of Java. As the steward of Java, Oracle is steadfastly committed to providing developers and enterprises with the latest tools to help them create innovative apps and services,"" said Georges Saab, senior vice president of development, Java Platform and Chair, OpenJDK Governing Board, Oracle. ""The powerful new enhancements in Java 19 are a testament to the monumental work across the global Java community.""The latest Java Development Kit (JDK) provides updates and improvements with seven JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). Most of these updates are to be delivered as follow-up preview features improving on functionality introduced in earlier releases.JDK 19 delivers language Improvements from OpenJDK project Amber (Record Patterns and Pattern Matching for Switch); library enhancements to interoperate with non-Java Code (Foreign Function and Memory API) and to leverage vector instructions (Vector API) from OpenJDK project Panama; and the first previews for Project Loom (Virtual Threads and Structured Concurrency), which will drastically reduce the effort required to write and maintain high-throughput, concurrent applications in Java.Story continues""Java developers are increasingly seeking tools to help them efficiently build highly functional applications for deployment in the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid environments,"" said Arnal Dayaratna, research vice president, software development, IDC. ""The enhancements in Java 19 deliver on these requirements and illustrate how the Java ecosystem is well-positioned to meet the current and future needs of developers and enterprises.""Oracle delivers new Java Feature releases every six months via a predictable release schedule. This cadence provides a steady stream of innovations while delivering continuous improvements to the platform's performance, stability, and security, helping increase Java's pervasiveness across organizations and industries of all sizes.The most significant updates delivered in Java 19 are:Updates and Improvements to the LanguageJEP 405: Record Patterns (Preview): Enables users to nest record patterns and type patterns to create a powerful, declarative, and composable form of data navigation and processing. This extends pattern matching to allow for more sophisticated and composable data queries.JEP 427: Pattern Matching for Switch (Third Preview): Enables pattern matching for switch expressions and statements by permitting an expression to be tested against a number of patterns. This allows users to express complex data-oriented queries concisely and safely.Library ToolsJEP 424: Foreign Function and Memory API (Preview): Enables Java programs to more easily interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking foreign functions (i.e., code outside the Java Virtual Machine [JVM]), and by safely accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), this API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process native data via a pure Java development model. This results in increased ease-of-use, performance, flexibility, and safety.JEP 426: Vector API (Fourth Incubator): Enables superior performance compared to equivalent scalar computations by expressing vector computations that reliably compile at runtime to vector instructions on supported CPU architectures.Ports JEP 422: Linux/RISC-V Port: Sets the stage for easier Linux/RISC-V implementations by integrating this port into the JDK main-line repository.Project Loom Preview/Incubator FeaturesJEP 425: Virtual Threads (Preview): Dramatically reduces the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications by introducing lightweight virtual threads to the Java Platform. Using virtual threads allows developers to easily troubleshoot, debug, and profile concurrent applications with existing JDK tools and techniques.JEP 428: Structured Concurrency (Incubator): Streamlines error handling and cancellation, improves reliability, and enhances observability by simplifying multithreaded programming and treating multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work.Driving Java Innovation in the CloudThe Java 19 release is the result of extensive collaboration between Oracle engineers and other members of the worldwide Java developer community via the OpenJDK Project and the Java Community Process (JCP). In addition to new enhancements, Java 19 is supported by Java Management Service – an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) native service – that provides a single pane of glass to help organizations manage Java runtimes and applications on-premises or on any cloud.Supporting Java CustomersThe Oracle Java SE Subscription is a pay-as-you-go offering that provides customers with best-in-class support, entitlement to GraalVM Enterprise, access to the Java Management Service, and the flexibility to upgrade at the pace of their businesses. This helps IT organizations manage complexity, contain costs, and mitigate security risks. In addition, Java SE and GraalVM Enterprise are offered free of charge on OCI, enabling developers to build and deploy applications that run faster, better, and with unbeatable cost-performance on Oracle Cloud.  Underscoring Java's popularity with the global developer community, Oracle is proud to recognize the one millionth completed Java certification.

The top-of-the-line RTX 4090 will cost $1,599 and go on sale Oct. 12. Other versions that come in November will retail for $899 and $1,199.The high-end version of the new chip will have 76 billion transistors and will be accompanied by 24GB of onboard memory on the RTX 4090, making it one of the most advanced in the industry. Nvidia is relying on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to produce the processor with its so-called 4N technology while Micron Technology Inc. is the memory provider. Nvidia has been using Samsung Electronics Co. to make Ada’s predecessor.The new technology promises to speed up the rate at which cards generate images using the traditional method of calculating where pixels are located on the screen while at the same time using AI to simulate others. It’s continuing a shift that Nvidia is pioneering that allows computers to make images appear more natural by building them using calculations of the path of individual rays of light.The approach could give customers a fresh reason to upgrade their technology -- something Nvidia could use right now. The chipmaker is suffering from a steep slowdown in demand for PC components. Last month, Nvidia reported much lower quarterly sales than it originally predicted and gave a disappointing forecast.Nvidia has been forced to deliberately slow down shipments to make sure its customers -- primarily makers of graphics cards sold as add-ins for high-end computers -- work through their stockpiles of unused inventory. That process should be completed by the end of the year, Huang has said.Story continuesThe new generation of technology, named after a 19th-century mathematician who many consider the first computer programmer, will improve existing games immediately and also learn from gameplay. That intelligence will go back to Nvidia, which will use its own computers to further improve the cards’ software.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

That's where they'll roll out Beyond Meat carne asada. Sounds delicious. Allie Canal is here with the details. I'll get it right one of these days. You tried it, though.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I did. I got a chance to try it yesterday. Now, this is a test product. Like you mentioned, it's only going to be available at around 50 Taco Bell locations in Dayton, Ohio. Once that testing period is over, perhaps they'll roll it out to some other cities and states. There it is in all its glory. I got to say, it really did taste like carne asada steak. Look at me. I mean, I also had a bad bellyache yesterday because I had a quesadilla, a burrito all with this Beyond carne asada. But it was good.SEANA SMITH: So maybe in moderation.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Maybe in moderation. Maybe not all at once, a warning to the viewers.[LAUGHTER]But I will say that Taco Bell really wanted to get this right. This took a little under two years to develop. They told me they didn't want to be a sea of the same. There's plant-based chicken out there. There's plant-based beef, which, by the way, Taco Bell is also working on as a proprietary product. But there hasn't been anything, at least not in the QSR market, when we talk about plant-based steaks. This is a really important initiative for them. They said this is actually going to cost the same as traditional steak. So they're not doing any upcharge or any premium there because they want people to enjoy it and have that value. They're all about--DAVE BRIGGS: That's shocking.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, they're all about creating value. But we've talked about the Mexican pizza. We talked about their craveable menu offerings. And that's really helped them with same-store sales beating expectations in the last quarter. So they just know what they're doing, I feel like, at Taco Bell.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: I love that they're not raising the price. Because usually when you have like-- when they substitute for, like, these Beyond Meats, it's always so much more expensive. Now, I've not had Taco Bell since college, but I love Beyond Meat. So this, if you're like-- in terms of, like, a crossover, I'm into this. I would definitely try this. When is it coming to everybody else?ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's the thing. It's TBD on everybody else. This is a partnership that Yum struck with Beyond Meat in February 2021. We have seen Beyond Meat products at KFC locations, at Pizza Hut locations. But this is the first one for Taco Bell. So we'll see how it performs in the market. I have a feeling it's going to do really well. If you take a look at something like the Impossible Burger at Burger King, for example, that did so, so well, continues to do big numbers for the company. So I feel like this is something that people want. They want a plant-based option, a vegan option.DAVE BRIGGS: I hope you washed that all down with a Baja Blast at Taco Bell because those are awesome.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thank God I didn't, because like I said, the bellyache.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, if you had a stomachache from that, imagine what the Baja Blast would have done to you.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Big regrets, but also not entire regrets. So we'll see.DAVE BRIGGS: Allie, good to see you. Thanks so much. That'll do it for us today on this extraordinary Fed day. For Allie and Seana and Rachelle, I'm Dave Briggs.

""When you think about the marketplace, there's already been a lot of innovation around plant-based proteins.""There are currently several plant-based chicken and beef options available at quick service restaurants (QSR) — from Panda Express’ Beyond Orange Chicken to Burger King's Impossible Whopper.""We didn't want to be a sea amongst the same,"" Schaaphok added. ""We wanted to do something disruptive and different that no one else had done before.""Taco Bell's Beyond Carne Asada Steak (Courtesy: Taco Bell x Beyond Meat)Taco Bell worked in collaboration with Beyond Meat for just under two years ""to get it right,"" she said. ""It just took a lot of back and forth and a lot of iterations to get it right. We needed the flavor to be there, the texture, the mouth feel. That's why the commercialization process took so long.""The Beyond Carne Asada Steak will cost the same as the chain's traditional steak option.""Oftentimes, you see other other brands up-charging for plant-based protein,"" Schaaphok said. ""Part of our core values is having food that's accessible across all of our restaurants, and we know that part of being accessible is having the right value.""Consumers have flocked to Taco Bell's cost-attractive Cravings Value Menu, especially amid inflation, and the brand recently completed an incredibly successful Mexican Pizza re-launch.Taco Bell was the only company in the Yum! portfolio to exceed same-store sales estimates with global comparable sales, coming in at +8% versus the expected +4.03%.

Brands (Pizza Hut) are plumbing fresh one-year lows as the entire pizza category continues along a post-pandemic slowdown.Investors may be right to cool on pizza stocks as consumers become more mobile and dine out again, Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull suggested in a new note on Tuesday. And as the pizza chains ramp up promotions to lure back diners, it could put pressure on profits.O'Cull was most cautious on Papa John's on the assessment that new products may not do much to lift sales.Here's what O'Cull had to say on Papa John's:Price Target: $100 (down from $120 previously)Rating: Buy (reiterated)Stock price movement assumed: +32%Pizza demand is weakening, per O'Cull's research. ""We estimate that the pizza category has been experiencing transaction declines since the beginning of the year, and our checks indicate consumer spending in the category has been more challenging recently,"" O'Cull wrote. ""It's unclear what might be driving the weaker pizza consumption; we surmise it's a combination of consumer fatigue toward pizza, more delivery and take-out options as restaurants have pivoted toward these channels, and a lack of pizza delivery drivers limiting capacity.""On pizza promotions, the analyst added: ""We believe another indication of weaker consumer demand is the increasing use of discounts (e.g., Domino's 20% off All Items promotion) and value platforms (e.g., Papa Pairings). On its second quarter conference call, Papa John's management indicated discounts and aggressive incentives would be delivered locally rather than through a national platform. So, we surmise the decision to introduce Papa Pairings (2 or more items for $6.99 each) in September was in response to significantly weak transaction performance in August/September.""Putting it all together, O'Cull said, ""we felt it was prudent to lower our third quarter same-restaurant sales projection to -4% from flat comps (Street +1.4%).""Story continuesHONOLULU, HI - APRIL 18: Papa John's Pizza store front in Honolulu - April 9, 2020. (Getty Images)Papa John's product launches 'have not been great,' O'Cull saysO'Cull questioned whether Papa John's new pizza bowls and other product launches would have much of an impact on sales growth.""During 3Q, the company introduced Papa Bowls (Chicken Alfredo, Garden Veggie, Italian Meats Trio, and create your own), which are bowls of pizza toppings with no crusts,"" O'Cull wrote. ""The product is intended to eliminate the veto vote of the low-carb consumer in the party (i.e., LSD mix) rather than being a broad-based traffic driver, like the Epic Stuffed Crust pizza. Unfortunately, reviews of the product have not been great. In our opinion, the execution of the concept was poor—moisture from the toppings is released as the bowls are baked, so the dish is often a bit waterlogged.""O'Cull didn't write off Papa John's product development efforts completely, however.""Although we are disappointed with Papa Bowls, it does not indicate a problem with the company's product innovation,"" the analyst said. ""We see several opportunities for the company to introduce new products, especially ones targeting the underutilized lunch daypart; for example, the company could introduce a line of oven-baked sub sandwiches.""Overall, ""we suspect the company was caught a bit off-guard by the category weakness and need for aggressive value,"" O'Cull continued, ""but we expect product innovation will be an important same-restaurant sales driver in 2023 for Papa John's.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

This collaboration aims to encourage innovation in insurance for nature-based solutions and help deliver climate mitigation benefits, improve biodiversity and benefit local communities, in alignment with the Paris Agreement.""The voluntary carbon market is rapidly expanding and represents a significant opportunity to drive environmental and social impacts on the climate transition through collaborative solutions – no one can transition alone,"" said Natalia Moudrak, climate resiliency leader for Aon's Public Sector Partnership.Global voluntary carbon markets, where carbon credits that represent certified removals or reductions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are bought and sold, continue to grow, driven by public and private sector commitments to net zero goals. Voluntary market carbon credit sales totaled $2 billion in 2021 and are projected to reach $50 billion by 2030, according to the Institute of International Finance.Revalue Nature designs and develops nature-based projects globally, protecting and regenerating forests, mangroves and other natural assets to produce future carbon credits and meet increasing demand. Aon is collaborating with Revalue Nature to help attract potential investors to these opportunities and to offer innovative insurance solutions to projects and their stakeholders to aid in de-risking these assets from damage and destruction due to natural perils and other pertinent risks. Through innovation in insurance, Aon aims to unlock greater access to capital for nature-based solutions, helping advance the integrity of voluntary carbon markets.Story continues""The climate and nature crisis requires nature-based solutions to be developed at a level of integrity and at a scale well beyond what is being achieved today,"" said Stuart Rowland, founder and CEO of Revalue Nature. ""Revalue is targeting that new level of scale and integrity by combining our platform, designed to streamline and scale project development, with a world-class carbon team. We see Aon as real innovators in the risk transfer solutions space, and this collaboration as a critical part of developing the next generation of nature-based projects.""Voluntary carbon markets are not presently regulated by governments and carbon project developers, communities, buyers, sellers, lenders, investors and various intermediaries can be exposed to a myriad of risks. The carbon credits from Revalue Nature will be generated through nature-based conservation and restoration projects spanning Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These projects are expected to be verified to meet and exceed the highest voluntary carbon standards. Layering insurance protection can work to help reduce investment risk and signal higher quality of projects.""As the demand for high-quality carbon credits increases, there is an underserved market that requires both risk management and financing solutions,"" said Joe Monaghan, CEO for Aon's Public Sector Partnership. ""Our market insights, analytics and risk transfer solutions, coupled with Revalue Nature's nature-based carbon projects and climate expertise, can help enable organizations to make better decisions as they work toward net-zero transition.""This collaboration is part of Aon's broader approach to delivering meaningful climate capabilities through innovation, analytics and matching capital to risk to help clients drive growth, accelerate their transition to net-zero goals, build physical resilience and navigate the risks and liabilities associated with economic and regulatory change.

According to the lawsuit, McDonald’s intentionally discriminated against AMG divisions Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civil Code § 51.5. On Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, defendant McDonald’s was denied a Motion to Dismiss by Judge Fernando M. Olguin of the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The case will now proceed to trial before a jury in May 2023.McDonald’s is the world’s leading global food service retailer with over 39,000 locations that generate over $100 billion in annual revenue. African Americans represent approximately 40 percent of McDonald’s U.S. sales, with McDonald’s taking billions of dollars each year from African American consumers. Per the lawsuit, of its approximately $1.6 billion annual advertising budget, McDonald’s spends less than approximately $5 million each year on African American-owned media, and it has refused to advertise on Entertainment Studios networks or The Weather Channel since Allen acquired the network in 2018. Per the lawsuit, the McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski makes approximately $11 million per year, which is more than double what McDonald’s spends per year on all of Black-owned media combined.The lawsuit (case number 2:21-cv-04972-FMO-MAA Entertainment Studios Networks, Inc. et al v. McDonald’s USA, LLC) alleges that McDonald’s refusal to contract is the result of racial stereotyping through McDonald’s tiered advertising structure that differentiates on the basis of race. The primary advertising tier for McDonald’s is referred to as “general market” and it constitutes the vast majority of McDonald’s advertising budget. McDonald’s, however, created a separate “African American” tier with a much smaller budget and less-favorable pricing and other terms. McDonald’s contracts with a separate ad agency, Burrell Communications, for this African American tier, thereby creating separate and unequal tracks for Black-owned media companies to earn advertising revenue. McDonald’s has created a discriminatory environment that is separate but not equal.Story continuesAccording to the lawsuit, McDonald’s relegated Entertainment Studios to the less-favorable African American tier even though the companies own and operate television networks that have general market appeal and do not specifically target African American audiences. McDonald’s does so because the companies are owned by Allen, an African American. Through this stereotyping, McDonald’s prevented Entertainment Studios and Weather Group from accessing McDonald’s general market advertising budget and deprived the companies of advertising revenue that otherwise would have been paid if McDonald’s treated the companies the same as similarly situated, white-owned companies.Numerous key points from the court ruling (see attached PDF) that are favorable to the AMG/Entertainment Studios/Weather Group position include, on page 11 of its opinion, the court recognized that racist comments by senior executives—even if not directed to the plaintiff—can evidence racial bias to support a racial discrimination claim under Section 1981. The lawsuit alleges that senior McDonald’s executives, including its current CEO, made racially derogatory comments that evidence a culture of racial hostility within the company.“This is about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy. McDonald’s takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back.”“The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between white corporate America and Black America, and McDonald’s is guilty of perpetuating this disparity. The economic exclusion must stop immediately,” said Byron Allen, founder/chairman/CEO of Allen Media Group.“McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski got caught sending racist text messages and McDonald’s has been sued by the Black franchisees, the Black executives, the Black employees, the Black vendors, and 52 percent of the McDonald’s stockholders recently voted to hire a third-party firm to investigate McDonald’s for civil rights violations. This is historic!!! The overt and systemic racism at McDonald’s is undeniable and indefensible. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s Chief Marketing Officer Morgan Flatley, and the Board of Directors must be fired.”“As alleged in our complaint, McDonald’s has engaged in pernicious racial discrimination in violation of federal and state law,” said counsel for Mr. Allen and his companies, David Schecter and Skip Miller, partners in Miller Barondess, LLP.“We are confident the jury will recognize the injustice that has occurred here and will award significant damages. We are looking forward to our day in court.”About Allen Media GroupChairman and CEO Byron Allen founded Allen Media Group/Entertainment Studios in 1993.

544,ac1d9abf-8405-3506-86a3-0c66ef43dc2b,MCD,2022-09-22,Is Trending Stock McDonald's Corporation (MCD) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-mcdonalds-corporation-mcd-130001681.html,1663765201,STORY,['MCD'],"[McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.52 indicates a change of +7% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $5.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7%. The $22.76 billion and $23.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2% and +3.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMcDonald's reported revenues of $5.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.86 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.42%. The EPS surprise was +4.08%.Over the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.McDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PLD) stock at an average sell price of US$147 during the past year. The company's market valuation decreased by US$13b after the stock price dropped 13% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisThe Co-Founder, Hamid Moghadam, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$46m worth of shares at a price of US$145 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$113). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.All up, insiders sold more shares in Prologis than they bought, over the last year.

If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Prologis Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Prologis insiders own about US$101m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Prologis Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Prologis insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

549,ec67c288-4d2c-3f84-be62-a105745cdcc6,TRIP,2022-09-22,3 Stocks to Benefit from Travel Industry Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-benefit-travel-industry-223410793.html,1663799650,STORY,"['ABNB', 'TRIP', 'H']","[With inflation at a 40-year high, the travel industry will certainly not be immune to the effects this has on consumers. However, declining Travel Price Index numbers (TPI) was a bright spot for the travel industry. August TPI number declined by 1.8%, showing that the cost of travel away from home in the U.S had gone down.Decreasing TPI numbers is a good sign for consumers and companies that benefit from travel and leisure services. Despite falling TPI numbers, many companies have been able to charge a premium for travel and leisure services due to the pent-up demand and delayed trips from the Covid-19 pandemic. This has also helped revenue by offsetting the cost of rising wages and other operating expenses. Let’s take a look at three stocks that have a chance to fight inflation and experience growth from consumers who are seeking travel and leisure experiences. Airbnb ABNB Airbnb is a leading platform for unique stays and experiences. The company provides a marketplace for connecting hosts and guests online or through mobile devices. Airbnb has become quite popular for vacation and travel experiences as people crave privacy and unique experiences outside of hotels.ABNB currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with EPS estimate revisions on the rise. Airbnb earnings are expected to climb swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.57 per share to +$2.25 a share in 2022, based on Zacks estimates. Fiscal 2023 calls for another 23% earnings growth. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to jump 39% this year and another 15% in FY23 to $9.65 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the stellar earnings growth outlook, ABNB is down -30% year to date. ABNB has underperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -20%. However, the near-term earnings growth could propel the stock.ABNB’s P/E of 51.9X is much lower than the high of 561.5X it saw earlier in the year and the median of 64.6X. Plus, ABNB’s price-to-sales ratio is starting to come down considerably, as shown in the above chart. We can see that ABNB’s P/S of 10.8X is well below the high of 33.3X it saw over the last two years and the median of 19.4X.Story continuesAirbnb’s Internet-Content Industry is also in the top 21% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Plus, the average Zacks Price Target of $142.93 offers 22% upside from current levels.Also, investors historically want to look for companies that will disrupt an industry. Airbnb while not in the same breadth yet as Amazon or Apple, is helping usher in a new era for hospitality and travel lodging. The more intimate and at-home feeling of Airbnb properties provides a different experience for vacation travelers.Hyatt Hotels H Even with inflation at 40-year highs, upscale hotel chains such as Hyatt have the advantage of pricing power and are able to benefit from premium prices in current market conditionsHyatt stock has outperformed the benchmark YTD, with it down only -9%. And Hyatt is up +63% over the last two years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s +17%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHyatt Hotels currently trades around $87 a share, roughly 19% below its 52-week highs. At current levels Hyatt has a forward P/E of 131.5X, which is very high for a hotel chain. The industry average is 20.4X, but Hyatt is expected to have substantial earnings growth.Hyatt Hotels currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings swinging from an adjusted loss of -$5.24 per share to +$0.68 a share in 2022. Hyatt is regaining its pre-pandemic operations with earnings expected to jump 179% in FY23.Top line growth is also expected to be up 89% this year and another 7% in FY23 to $6.13 billion. It is also important to note that estimate revisions have gone up in the last 60 days. Better yet, Hyatt’s projected revenue for this year and FY23 are now higher than its 2019 pre-pandemic revenue. TripAdvisor TRIP TripAdvisor is one of the largest online travel research companies in the world, providing a platform for users to share reviews, ratings, and opinions on hotels, destinations, attractions and restaurants. The company also facilitates bookings between hotel suppliers and consumers using its web portals.TripAdvisor’s platform has become important to consumers looking for reviews from other consumers that sought similar experiences. The site is beneficial in the decision-making process for travel planning.  TRIP is down -13% this year but its earnings growth shows that the company is getting back to pre-pandemic levels. Plus, over the last two years, TRIP is up a respectable +20% to outperform the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom the chart above we can see TripAdvisor’s sharp peak over the last two years. Wall Street began to ponder the premium it was paying for TRIP and the stock started to fall to compress its valuation alongside the broader market drop. Trading around $24 a share, TRIP has a P/E of 30.5X, much lower than the 183.1X high over the last two years. This is also getting closer to the industry average of 23.6X.The earnings growth is starting to show TRIP is more reasonably valued than it was in the past. According to Zacks estimates, TRIP earnings are projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.30 to +$0.81 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to grow another 76%, with top line growth expected to climb 63% this year and another 16% in FY23 to $1.71 billion. TripAdvisor’s revenue is edging closer to pre-pandemic levels with FY23 projections expected to surpass 2019 revenue.  TRIP currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and the Internet-Commerce industry is in the bottom 36% of Zacks Industries. Despite being overvalued in the past, the company’s growth is starting to look more attractive. Plus, the average Zacks price target suggests 9% upside from current levels.Bottom LineThe travel industry is certainly not immune to the ramifications of inflation. Instead of booking a flight and hotel for a vacation, consumers usually hold off on leisure spending amidst high inflation. However, higher-income consumers are still spending, with travel and leisure being a bright spot.With that being said, gas prices also declined considerably in August by 10.5%. This was the strongest monthly decline since April 2020. Lodging fares and recreation remained virtually unchanged, but airfare declined 4.6% from July. The broader travel industry is slowly but surely edging back to pre-pandemic levels, presenting opportunities for investors to capitalize on the continued recovery.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The documentary is likely to help TRIP gain traction among young travelers.The above-mentioned efforts will help TripAdvisor gain investors’ confidence in the near term and the long haul.Shares of TRIP have been down 24% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s decline of 23.7%.TripAdvisor, Inc. Price and ConsensusTripAdvisor, Inc. Price and ConsensusTripAdvisor, Inc. price-consensus-chart | TripAdvisor, Inc. QuoteGrowing Initiatives to Boost ProspectsIn addition to the aforesaid efforts, TripAdvisor signed a partnership agreement with the San Diego Tourism Authority for $1.5 million to launch customized digital content and interactive campaigns for attracting travelers to the city.In March 2022, TRIP collaborated with Walgreens to promote the latter’s COVID-19 testing solutions so that travelers can enjoy safer trips during spring break and school vacations.In February, TripAdvisor’s subsidiary Cruise Critic collaborated with Booking Holding’s BKNG subsidiary KAYAK. With this partnership, travelers in the United States searching for a cruise on KAYAK can access Cruise Critic’s vast network of cruise itineraries and reviews.With these growing initiatives, TripAdvisor is expected to continue expanding its presence in the booming travel market.Story continuesThe underlined market’s growth is attributed to increasing international tourism, growing social media penetration and technological advancements.Per a ResearchAndMarkets report, the global travel market is likely to reach $451.2 billion by 2026, witnessing a CAGR of 13.9% during the 2022-2026 forecast period.Competitive Travel MarketGiven the solid prospects in the travel industry, TripAdvisor’s competitors, including Booking Holdings, Expedia EXPE and Airbnb ABNB, are also positioning themselves well to capitalize on the improving travel potential.Booking Holdings is benefiting from an improvement in its booking trends owing to increasing travel demand. A surge in repeat customers is creating growth in its active customers, which remains a tailwind. Last month, BKNG’s brand Agoda partnered with the Ant Group to integrate Alipay+ rewards and discount services into its platform to boost the transaction conversion rate. This is likely to help BKNG gain momentum among travelers.Expedia is gaining traction from customers owing to its robust portfolio offerings. Moreover, its website provides travelers with destination and flight plan choices, details of the places to be visited, maps, local restaurants, things to do, cruises, special offers and consumer reviews, so that they can book according to their preferences.Airbnb’s growing technological efforts to attract more hosts and guests to its platform remain noteworthy. This apart, ABNB recently joined forces with Visit Bloomington to promote safe travel with a focus on local attractions, unique stays and experiences to boost travel demand in Bloomington. The partnership is also focused on supporting local shops, restaurants and workers of the city who depend on the local tourism industry.Nevertheless, TripAdvisor’s growing product launches and strategic partnerships are expected toboost its competitive prowess against the abovementioned peers.

(PRNewsFoto/Protiviti) (PRNewsfoto/Protiviti)Four in 10 finance organizations are incorporating ESG into more of their sourcing decisions.Further, the survey reveals that 72% of respondents' finance operations experienced disruptions or delays because of supply chain challenges, pandemic-related impacts, and/or the effects of inflation in the past year. The majority (51%) of those that experienced such delays say they engaged a managed services provider or business process outsourcing firm to address the resulting challenges.Top 10 PrioritiesIn the survey of 1,064 CFOs and vice presidents, directors and managers of finance, which was conducted globally in June and July 2022, participants ranked their priorities for the coming year. Specifically, the top 10 priorities for CFOs and VPs of finance are:1.     Security and privacy of data2.     Profitability reporting and analysis3.     Blockchain/smart contracts4.     Cloud-based applications5.     Financial planning and analysis6.     Changing demands and expectations of internal customers 7.     Leadership (within your organization)8.     Process mining9.     Automation10.  The changing roles of human resources, leadership &amp; development, and recruitingNotably, blockchain and smart contracts moved up in the top 10 list this year. CFOs and finance leaders may be employing these technologies as part of their approach to supply chain resiliency and innovation.Story continues""This year's survey findings confirm that CFOs continue to extend the value they deliver to the organization far beyond the boundaries of traditional finance and accounting activities, as they reimagine their roles and embrace responsibilities tied to supply chain, automation, analytics, ESG, leadership skills and more,"" said Christopher Wright, global leader of Protiviti's Business Performance Improvement practice. ""Through recent tumultuous years, CFOs globally have been presented with opportunities to establish and stress-test their expanding strategic roles in real-time, which has helped them contribute to the dialog in the C-suite and boardroom.""The Protiviti survey also found that ESG strategies and reporting take center stage – from increased focus on and frequency of ESG reporting to formal and documented DEI programs, CFOs and finance leaders are devoting more time, attention and resources to enterprise ESG initiatives. Of note, four in 10 finance organizations are incorporating ESG into more of their sourcing decisions, considering not just sustainability but also social issues.CFOs are also addressing concerns about inflationary trends: for example, 35% of CFOs are assessing the need for new skills and talent both inside and outside of their organizations; 33% are balancing the risk of higher staff attrition against potential compensation increases; and 32% are refining and/or increasing scenario planning.""More CFOs and finance leaders now realize that high-impact disruptions like interest rate volatility, trade wars, and Russia's war on Ukraine have exposed the fragility of the global supply chain model,"" said David Petrucci, a managing director and global leader of Protiviti's Supply Chain and Operations practice. ""CFOs are paying more attention to considerations such as how long suppliers can operate amid a catastrophic event and how long their own organizations can operate amid prolonged supply chain disruptions. It's essential for them to look beyond traditional cost calculations by evaluating and monitoring supply chain reliability, responsiveness and resiliency.""The survey results reflect responses from finance professionals worldwide at both public and private companies across a broad range of industries. In addition to presenting findings from respondents overall, the Protiviti survey report, titled ""Reimagine,"" compares results from respondents at the CFO and VP of finance levels with those at director and manager levels. Comparisons of the sometimes-marked differences between their responses by level provide additional insights for senior leadership to address.Survey Resources AvailableKey findings of the Protiviti 2022 Finance Trends Survey are available now for digital exploration on the firm's website – click here to access.

By the end of trading that week, FedEx's share price had slid more than 28% from where it was on Subramaniam's first day as CEO as investors questioned FedEx's forecasting ability.""You can't say things are good, give guidance, raise the dividend, and then blow shareholders to smithereens,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.FedEx said it would discuss the global economic outlook and results for the quarter ended Aug. 31 in a conference call after the market closes on Thursday.Reuters spoke with Bradshaw and five other investors who bought FedEx stock when it looked cheap versus its more profitable and better performing rival United Parcel Service, believing a FedEx business revamp promised healthy returns. Achieving that vision now seems further out than they had hoped.Most of those investors, including one who sold most of his holdings in January, still believe FedEx can eventually generate higher profits by shedding assets, slashing costs and combining its independently operated Express and Ground businesses.But patience is wearing thin, especially after UPS executives stood by their own forecasts this month.Asked if last week's warning shook his confidence in FedEx's new CEO, Bradshaw said, ""100%. I wish I would have owned more UPS and forgot FedEx."" Bradshaw said the firm holds roughly 15,000 shares across accounts.Story continues'SO BAD, IT'S GOOD'Investors agree business conditions are deteriorating due to softer e-commerce demand, soaring inflation and on-and-off COVID lockdowns in China. But most believe FedEx's pain has been mostly self-inflicted, noting it failed to ground planes, shutter corporate offices and reduce unneeded labor hours fast enough to offset the downturn.""The decline in profitability doesn't reconcile with the more modest shortfall in revenues. The numbers don't fully add up,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in White Plains, New York, which holds about 58,000 FedEx shares.Katz remains confident in FedEx long-term, but he and other investors want to hear executives on Thursday detail what went wrong and how they will set things right.Analysts and investors have focused on the deterioration at FedEx Express, where a deflating pandemic e-commerce bubble has hammered demand for lucrative air shipments to the United States from Asia, a business where the company has a larger footprint than UPS.When FedEx said last week that first-quarter Express revenue would decline $500 million, Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra estimated that translated to a similar drop in profit. He said in a research note that the one-for-one decline implied a ""concerning inability"" to manage expenses.The silver lining was that the news clarified FedEx's challenges. ""'It's 'so bad, it's good', with respect to making it even clearer that a much more dramatic overhaul is needed,"" Mehrotra said.FedEx also said last week that it struggled with Express service challenges in Europe, where its costly and trouble-plagued TNT integration is stretching into its seventh year since the deal closed in 2016.FedEx warned business conditions would worsen in the current quarter, which ends as the key Christmas package delivery season begins. Warnings from FedEx and others in the global cargo market have cast a pall over the year-end holiday shopping season.FedEx said first-quarter revenue at its U.S. Ground delivery business would miss company targets by $300 million. Last year, the company overestimated growth for the 2021 Christmas season, damaging relations with independent delivery contractors and leaving investors wondering whether FedEx can effectively model demand.Late last month, FedEx told Reuters it was confident in its ""stress tested"" holiday forecast for this year.Trip Miller, managing director at Memphis-based hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, said he did not blame FedEx for its missteps, but locked in profits by selling more than 90% of his shares in January as he saw warnings that demand was slipping.""They don't turn this ship fast,"" he said.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Jamie Freed in Sydney; Editing by Ben Klayman and David Gregorio)]"

It’s important to note that long-time CEO Fred Smith stepped down from his position earlier this year in that same month.Obviously, the announcement has enormous implications.Market participants took the news hard; FedEx shares closed down more than 20% the following trading day.In response, another notable transportation company, United Parcel Service UPS, also experienced adverse price action.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of both companies in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the company already slashing its guidance, it raises a very valid question – what is going on with FedEx?Let’s take a closer look.Preliminary Q1 ResultsThe company forecasts quarterly EPS of $3.33, penciling in a steep 25% decline from year-ago quarterly earnings of $4.37 per share.Revenue is forecasted to come in at $23.2 billion, reflecting a 5.5% Y/Y uptick.The company stated that its Q1 results were heavily affected by global volume softness that picked up in the final weeks of the quarter, which is definitely not a good sign.FedEx’s Express segment was impacted by an overall weak macroeconomic backdrop in Asia and services challenges in Europe, leading to roughly a $500 million revenue shortfall relative to company forecasts.Further, FedEx’s Ground revenue is expected to come in roughly $300 million below company expectations.FedEx stated that it took swift and immediate action to mitigate costs, but operating expenses still remained high relative to overall demand.Raj Subramaniam, CEO of FedEx, says, “Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter, both internationally and in the U.S. We are swiftly addressing these headwinds, but given the speed at which conditions shifted, first quarter results are below our expectations.”Story continuesIn addition, FedEx has laid out many cost initiatives, including a reduction in flight frequencies and temporarily parking aircraft, consolidation of certain sort operations to drive productivity, deferral of staff hiring, and the closure of over 90 FedEx Office locations.To put it simply, FedEx had a rough quarter.TNT Integration HeadachesFlipping the pages back a few years, FedEx acquired TNT Express in May 2016 in a deal valued at $4.8 billion.The acquisition was expected to spur growth across Europe, but the company’s integration has been complicated for FedEx and has cost them millions.FedEx’s Express global air network, paired with TNT’s intra-European road system, was envisioned as a worldwide one-stop shipping hub for European and non-European companies.Further, the acquisition pushed United Parcel Service out of the bidding for TNT, essentially giving them a leg-up on one of its main rivals.Issues surfaced almost immediately.TNT’s information technology and physical infrastructure were reportedly outdated, and the company’s sales were weak around the acquisition time. A shrinking top line was attributed to a sluggish European economy in the decade’s second half and low-income types of freight pushed by TNT.Integration of TNT is still an ongoing headache for FedEx, with the air network finally expected to be fully integrated in 2022.UPS Also In Trouble?While it’s nearly impossible to ignore FedEx’s preliminary quarterly results, it’s important to note that a management shakeup and unfavorable acquisitions are their own problems.UPS reported its quarterly results in late July, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 5% and beating revenue projections by a marginal 0.2%.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company reaffirmed its full-year 2022 financial guidance and even raised targeted share repurchases to a mighty $3 billion for 2022.The company’s average daily volume declined by 4%, attributed to actions taken to optimize overall network volume.Further, in a challenging global market, the company’s operating profit increased to $1.2 billion, and revenue per piece increased by nearly 15%. Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS, says, “While the external environment is ever-changing, our better not bigger strategic framework has fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, enabling greater agility and strong financial performance.”It appears that United Parcel Service’s “better, not bigger” strategy is paying off.Bottom LineAll in all, FedEx has faced many unfavorable dynamics over the last several years, including the poor integration of TNT Express and long-time CEO Fred Smith leaving the company earlier in the year.Now, the company has entirely cut its previous FY23 guidance.On the contrary, United Parcel Service UPS posted a notably strong quarter in its latest print and even reaffirmed its 2022 guidance in the face of harsh business environments.FDX’s recent disheartening guidance surely warrants some concern. However, to put it simply, many of the issues FedEx is facing seem to be their own problems.On another note, it doesn't seem likely that FedEx was caught off guard by any means; geopolitical issues have been prevalent all year, and the Fed started its tightening cycle in the same month the previous guidance was given.Operating issues have been prevalent within FedEx FDX for years.(NOTE: We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

557,9f767b04-9a4e-3107-ac5e-e3f9767415ae,UPS,2022-09-22,Returns On Capital Are A Standout For United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-standout-united-parcel-120010878.html,1663761610,STORY,['UPS'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for United Parcel Service, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.26 = US$14b ÷ (US$70b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 26%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for United Parcel Service compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From United Parcel Service's ROCE Trend?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at United Parcel Service. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 26%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 84% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what United Parcel Service has. Since the stock has returned a solid 72% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if United Parcel Service can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing United Parcel Service that you might find interesting.United Parcel Service is not the only stock earning high returns.

That’s the smallest increase in the institute’s periodic snapshots, compiled roughly once every six months since May 2020.“Amazon is making significant adjustments,” Joseph Schwieterman, the Chicago-based institute’s director, said in an interview. “The company apparently was overly optimistic about its need to grow its supply chain so rapidly at the height of the pandemic.”The world’s largest online retailer entered this year with too many workers and facilities as consumers returned to normal shopping habits. Amazon has shuttered, delayed or abandoned plans for dozens of warehouses in the US and Europe, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. The company reduced its workforce -- primarily through attrition, Amazon says -- by almost 100,000 people between March and June, the biggest quarterly decline in its history.The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The shares fell 2.3% to $121.85 at 1:37 p.m. in New York.Amazon Air, which relies on pilots from a handful of partner carriers, flies packaged items en route to customers. That operation grew rapidly in the last few years, tacking on new airport hubs, leasing and purchasing more aircraft. It even contemplated acquiring bigger long-haul jets to import goods directly from Asia.FedEx Corp. shocked investors last week after withdrawing its annual earnings forecast and saying preliminary results for the quarter fell short of expectations, sending shares of the package-delivery giant tumbling. Analysts subsequently said some of the company’s woes were self-inflicted and weren’t solely the result of slowing consumer demand.Story continuesAmazon Air began flying to Las Vegas and El Paso, Texas, recently, Schwieterman said, and has continued to grow in Europe, where it relies on hubs in Milan and Leipzig, Germany. Amazon also charters flight on planes operated by its partners but not branded “Amazon Air,” Schwieterman said. The number of those flights, which can be difficult to assess, appears little changed since March, he said.Schwieterman said the Seattle-based comany has been increasing flight activity from its $1.5 billion hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, since expanding operations last year. A cluster of overnight flights, departing between midnight and 6 a.m., seem designed to enable next-day delivery. The hub is small compared with major facilities operated by FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc., but serves a similar function, facilitating connections to other flights within Amazon’s network.“Amazon wants CVG to be the nerve center of its overnight shipping system,” Schwieterman said, using the airport’s abbreviation.(Updated with shares.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

569,4f3f4f03-457b-3d62-abe9-5eb96f547d45,FTI,2022-09-22,"Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Shell's CEO Succession, Williams' Acquisition & More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-gas-stock-roundup-shells-121812771.html,1663762692,STORY,"['LNG', 'FTI', 'NG=F', 'CL=F', 'WMB', 'SHEL']","[It was a week when both oil and natural gas prices continued their decline.On the news front, Europe’s largest oil company Shell plc SHEL announced the departure of chief executive officer (CEO) Ben van Beurden next year, while energy infrastructure operator The Williams Companies WMB closed the buyout of natural gas storage firm NorTex Midstream. Developments associated with Cheniere Energy LNG, APA Corporation APA and TechnipFMC FTI also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was another bearish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.9% to close at $85.11 per barrel, while natural gas prices decreased 2.9% to end at $7.764 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).U.S. oil prices moved lower as the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") showed a build in stockpiles in its latest weekly release. As it is, crude remained under pressure from familiar fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.Natural gas notched a bigger weekly loss, primarily due to a bearish inventory report. Unfavorable weather forecasts and a spurt in production have also been blamed for pushing prices lower.Recap of the Week’s Most-Important Stories1. Shell has declared that the incumbent CEO of the company — Ben van Beurden — will step down from his position by the end of 2022. Wael Sawan, SHEL’s head of gas and renewables, will succeed Ben van Beurden and take charge as the CEO, starting Jan 1, 2023.Ben van Beurden, however, will continue working as an adviser to the board till Jun 30, 2023, after which he will leave the group. He has been serving as the CEO of the British energy major since January 2014. Prior to this, Ben van Beurden served as the downstream director and as the executive vice president of chemicals before that. During his tenure, Shell acquired the British multinational oil and gas company — BG Group plc — which turned out to be one of SHEL’s largest acquisitions in decades.Presently serving as the director of integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions, Wael Sawan is expected to help continue Shell’s green transition strategy, which aims at cutting down the firm’s greenhouse-gas emissions and its transformational strategy initiated by Ben van Beurden. Having previously worked as the director of upstream, Sawan has been part of the organization for more than 25 years. (Shell to Replace Current CEO With Wael Sawan in 2023)2. The Williams Companies recently announced that it has concluded the $423-million deal to acquire Houston-based NorTex Midstream, a fully contracted natural gas pipeline and storage asset, from the private equity firm Tailwater Capital’s affiliate.As part of the contract, the Tulsa, OK-based pipeline operator will take over NorTex assets. These include roughly about 80 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines along with 36 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.Per WMB, NorTex assets offer crucial service to almost 4 GW of gas-fired power generation, allowing Texas energy providers to meet peak demand effectively. The assets also enable Williams to provide storage services for the Permian gas directed toward the rising Gulf Coast LNG demand. (Williams Acquires NorTex Midstream Assets for $423M)3. Cheniere Energy, the Houston, TX-based liquefied natural gas exporter, recently announced its intention to pay higher dividends and augment share buybacks while adding to its production units.This comes at a time when Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Cheniere’s profits are up due to mounting energy prices and liquefied natural gas demand as a result of Europe trying to find alternatives to Russian gas over Moscow’s military action in Ukraine.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.LNG will hike its annual dividend by 20% to $1.58 per share from the $1.32 payout initiated last year. Moreover, the firm projects more than $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and more than $20 per share of run-rate distributable cash flow. The full-year 2022 distributable cash flow forecast was increased to the range of $8.1 billion-$8.6 billion from the earlier guidance range of $6.9-$7.4 billion. (Cheniere to Increase Repurchase, Raises Earnings Forecast)4   APA Corporation recently got approval from the board of directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 12.5 cents to 25 cents per share. The new payout will be on Nov 22 to its common shareholders of record on Oct 21. Following the 100% hike this quarter, APA’s annual dividend of $1 per share yields 2.41%, which is better than the S&amp;P 500’s 1.54%.The macro environment for U.S. Exploration &amp; Production operators like APA remains robust, thanks to high commodity prices and improved fundamentals that should aid long-term growth. This positive backdrop, together with APA’s significant debt profile improvement and healthy cash flows, allows the company to reward investors with a dividend hike.APA management sees the dividend hike as part of its commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. However, stock buyback continues to be the company’s preferred tool to distribute cash, with APA adding another 40 million shares to its buyback authorization. (APA Ups Shareholder Returns: Hikes Dividend, Expands Buyback)5   TechnipFMC declared that it was awarded a “significant” engineering, procurement, construction and installation contract by TotalEnergies for its Lapa North East field situated in the pre-salt Santos Basin offshore Brazil. Located in the pre-salt Santos Basin, the Lapa field commenced oil production in 2016 via the MODEC-supplied FPSO Cidade de Caraguatatuba MV27.Per the contract, the French-American, U.K.-domiciled oilfield services major will reconfigure and set up umbilicals and flexible pipes in a new configuration that will further secure the production of the field. Per TechnipFMC’s definition of a significant contract, the deal is worth between $75 million and $250 million.President, Subsea, at TechnipFMC, Jonathan Landes, mentioned that the Brazilian offshore market is becoming more diverse concerning the scope of work as well as customer opportunity. “On Lapa North East, we are working with a valued client with whom we have built a trusted relationship. By offering the flexibility of a phased campaign, we are helping TotalEnergies accelerate its schedule and begin production sooner,"" he added.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — was down 2.7% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has increased 8.5%.What’s Next in the Energy World?Following last week’s sliding fortunes for oil and gas, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for further guidance on the direction of prices. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. News related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict and the potential demand boost from the easing of coronavirus lockdowns in China will be the other factors that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Known for amassing a fortune within the stock market, it’s easy to see why some call him one of the most successful investors of all time.Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a diversified holding company whose subsidiaries engage in insurance, freight rail transportation, energy generation and distribution, manufacturing, and many others.Investors track every move he makes.And that’s what we’re here to look at today.Three stocks that the Oracle of Omaha has bought in 2022 include Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY, HP Inc. HPQ, and Activision Blizzard ATVI.Below is a year-to-date chart illustrating the performance of all three of his buys with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.Activision BlizzardActivision Blizzard is a leader in video game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher, most well-known for its hit franchise Call of Duty.In January, tech-titan Microsoft MSFT acquired ATVI to bolster its stance in the gaming industry.Berkshire has been adding to its position within Activision Blizzard for a merger arbitrage play, meaning there’s a strong belief that the acquisition will go through at the agreed-upon $95 per share price tag.With ATVI shares currently trading around $75 per share, the current $95 per share price tag reflects an upside of nearly 27%. Needless to say, that would be a very sizable gain.Activision Blizzard’s growth trajectory is forecasted to take a sizable hit in FY22, with earnings and revenue projected to decline by 24% and 4%, respectively.In FY23, however, the growth picture turns visibly green – earnings are forecasted to climb 30%, and revenue looks to climb a double-digit 18%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOccidental Petroleum Corp. Founded in 1920, Occidental Petroleum Corporation is an integrated oil and gas company with significant exploration and production exposure. OXY operates through three segments: Oil and Gas, Chemical, and Midstream and Marketing.Story continuesBuffett has been buying OXY stock aggressively, signaling a substantial bet on the energy sector. So far, in 2022, the strategy has handsomely paid off amid the boom in energy.To little surprise, the company’s earnings outlook has turned notably bright over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOf course, OXY’s growth prospects are stellar – earnings are forecasted to soar by an incredible triple-digit 330% Y/Y in FY22.And the growth doesn’t stop there, of course – OXY’s annual revenue is projected to climb nearly 50% Y/Y in FY22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company has a very favorable free cash flow trend, as seen in the chart below. In its latest print, OXY reported quarterly free cash flow of a steep $4.4 billion, penciling in a massive 70% Y/Y uptick and a 66% sequential increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHP Inc.HP is a leading provider of personal computing and other access devices to consumers globally. It’s worth noting that HP Inc. is the surviving entity following the November 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard into two separate publicly traded entities.The purchase looks like a classic Buffett value play – HPQ’s 6.5X forward earnings multiple is cheap, nowhere near its 9.1X five-year median, and representing a massive 70% discount relative to its Zacks Computer and Technology Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly warranting concern, analysts have been bearish on their earnings outlook over the last several months with a 100% revision agreement percentage. Its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further displays the unfavorable near-term earnings outlook.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHP is forecasted to register Y/Y earnings growth of 7.6% for FY22, but in FY23, the company’s bottom line is forecasted to take an 8% hit.Revenue is forecasted to decline by a marginal 0.4% in FY22 and a further 4% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile shares are cheap, it’s important to remember that earnings are forecasted to take a sizable hit in its next fiscal year.Bottom LineIn a quick turn of events, Buffett has splashed into his cash in 2022, buying at an aggressive pace that’s generally not seen from the Oracle of Omaha.Clearly, he sees value in areas.All three stocks above – Activision Blizzard ATVI, Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY, and HP Inc. HPQ – have been additions by Buffett in 2022.Of the three, ATVI is undoubtedly the most exciting play from Buffett, and his OXY purchase reflects a further focus on the energy boom. With HPQ, it will be beneficial for investors to wait until favorable earnings estimate revisions start coming in.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

577,d3876db8-95d0-3be6-8afd-453d59704988,OXY,2022-09-22,European energy transition will 'herald the next few years of pain': Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/european-energy-transition-herald-next-203000385.html,1663792200,VIDEO,"['BP', 'BPAQF', 'CVX', 'OXY', 'BZ=F', 'XOM', 'CL=F', 'COP']","[OPIS Global Head of Energy Analysis Tom Kloza joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss oil markets both in the U.S. and abroad, specifically Europe's ongoing energy crisis and how it could impact the U.S. economy.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- The war in Ukraine resulting in the European energy crisis coming to a head. Germany nationalizing energy giant Uniper, while a UK bailout is expected to cut energy bills for businesses in half this winter. What is ahead, though? Tom Kloza is the OPIS Head of Energy Analysis. Good to see you, sir. Let's start with the words of Vladimir Putin, which have changed the energy situation around the globe. What's the biggest impact of the war in Ukraine moving forward on energy?TOM KLOZA: Well, I think the impact is clearly if he pulls some of the levers that it can pull to cut off the flow of hydrocarbons, either natural gas or crude oil or refined products, to the West, I mean, he's obviously going to put his people through incredible pain, and that doesn't stop him. So we've seen natural gas prices drop tremendously in Europe. But they've dropped from $550 oil equivalent to about $300 to $350. So it's still very, very much a threat.If you wake up one morning and he's been ousted or whatever, say, a little prayer of thanks but also figure that oil prices and energy prices will drop. But in the meantime, I think the energy transition is going to be moving into another quarter. That's going to herald really the next few years of pain.- And Tom, we know that we didn't quite make it to 100 days of gas prices going down. But in terms of the domino effects and from the energy crisis in Europe, what are the expectations for what we could see here in the US?TOM KLOZA: Well, I think the expectations are that we've survived a gasoline scare when we were $501.65 on June 14. And every day of the summer with the exception of today, we've seen prices come off a little bit. That probably ends, but I don't think the next big move is higher, or at least not in 2022. In 2023, we'll see what I call ""petronoia,"" the fear that there's not going to be enough petroleum molecules to go around, particularly in the gasoline season. It will manifest itself. And then maybe we'll have another move.Story continuesFor the next four months, gasoline has the moves like Al Gore as opposed to the moves like Jagger. But diesel, and heating oil, and jet fuel, those are the products to watch. We're seeing in Ohio, today, for example, the price of diesel is up $0.20 or so a gallon on the loss of a refinery there. And that breaks a string of really, really smooth refining operations in 2022.- Tom, I like that analogy there with Al Gore and Jagger.- Al Gore called, he can dance.- Yeah. Let's talk about this the live picture because we have two very different drivers here in terms of supply. On the one hand, we have Russia's war with Ukraine. Obviously, the energy crisis that's happening right now in Europe. On the other side of the equation, we have the global slowdown economically. I guess, how tight do you see supplies getting by the end of the year? And what does that picture look like looking ahead into next year?TOM KLOZA: If you could tell me what happens in China, I'd probably be able to answer that question very well. But China has really been a laggard or it's been behaving as though it's in a terrible recession right now. If they start with the appetite to take up all of the crude oil that's out there in the markets, I mean, crude oil markets can turn around very, very quickly.And I would say that these episodes of $80 or even if we get into the $70s, they're going to give way to higher prices for crude in the next few years. I don't think the 2023, for example, is going to be much more expensive than what we saw in the summer of 2022. But I do believe that the bias is toward higher prices for energy as opposed to lower.- WTI crude settling at $83.36 down a bit. And Brent, just above $90. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve levels not seen since 1984. What do you make of the lack of urgency on the administration's behalf? And what are the implications there?TOM KLOZA: You know, it's hard to tell because in the oil and gas industry, it's incredibly Republican-biased. And they're never going to give Joe Biden any credit for anything, even if it works for the moment. The problem is if you put up a mission accomplished sign after 98 days of lower gas prices, you might have to take it down real quick.So I don't think that there's any imminent danger to replenish the Reserve. I mean, in essence, we have reserves of light sweet oil in the shale in the Permian, New Mexico and North Dakota. But it's quite a political football. I think that'll-- you know, you'll see the White House take credit for the lower prices because of the SPR releases. And for the last few months, I think that's had an impact. We saw record-high prices in every single hydrocarbon with the extent-- exception of the two kind of benchmarks, Brent and WTI.- And Tom, I want to ask you, because you did focus on diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel as some spaces that you're watching. What do you think people are not paying attention to then? And what are your expectations?TOM KLOZA: I think what they're not paying attention to is the fact that we've already been in progress for an energy transition, particularly for diesel, fuel, and heating oil. Now, there's not a terrible amount of people that use heating oil to heat their homes in the winter. But we don't have much in storage anymore. I mean, we're way below five-year storage levels in the US and in Europe, and even in the Far East. So it wouldn't take much in terms of cold weather to really mount an assault on some super high prices for diesel, for jet fuel since sometimes it gets used in some of the heating cuts in the winter time. And diesel is the biggest worry, I think, going forward.It probably doesn't really rally until after the midterms, but we might see some ideas floated like Jones Act waivers to send diesel fuel from the Gulf Coast to New York or the Northeast, where it's desperately needed.]"

Flows into ESG ETFs have faltered this year as performance has suffered due to too much tech exposure and low allocation to energy stocks.There is increasing regulatory scrutiny as well amid allegations of greenwashing and mislabeling of products as ESG.Strive Asset Management, backed by high profile investors like Peter Thiel and Bill Ackman, wants to remove politics from investing and promote excellence capitalism. The “anti-woke” firm says large asset managers push divisive social and political agendas, which cause companies to underperform and harm investors’ interests.The US energy industry was the most impacted by the rise in ESG investing as it vastly reduced investments in domestic oil and gas exploration and production. The firm recently launched the Strive U.S. Energy ETF Energy ETF DRLL, which would use its shareholder-voting power to encourage energy companies to “drill more and frack more.”DRLL has already gathered about $330 million in assets within six weeks of its launch. Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX, ConocoPhillips COP, EOG Resources EOG and Occidental Petroleum OXY are its top holdings.Strive launched its second ETF this week.

Further, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will help accelerate Occidental's direct air capture technology, she said at IETA's North America Climate Summit.The $430 billion IRA, seen as the biggest climate change package in U.S. history, was signed into law last month.

The company posted better-than-expected results for the second quarter of 2022. The robust performance of the WATCHMAN device instills optimism. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 7% compared with a 48.4% fall of the industry and an 11.8% drop in the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $59.61 billion. Its earnings for the second quarter topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.8%.In the past five years, the company’s earnings grew 8.1%, compared to the industry’s 9.7% growth and the S&amp;P 500’s 13.4% increase. The company’s long-term projected growth of 10.5% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s expectation of 11.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayImpressive Q2 Results: Boston Scientific ended the second quarter of 2022 with adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Total operational sales grew 10% from the prior year’s levels, while organic sales rose 7%. The reported quarter’s organic revenues also exceeded the high end of the company’s guidance range of 3-6%. BSX’s organic growth performance was strong across all regions, where most of its businesses grew faster than their competitors in their respective markets.Impressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: Boston Scientific’s acquisition of Israel-based Lumenis has expanded the Urology portfolio with differentiated laser technology. Apart from this, the acquisition of Preventice Solutions grew 20% on a full-year pro forma basis in 2021, driven by the company’s differentiated portfolio and strong execution. In the second quarter of 2022, the Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis Medical buyouts contributed 300 basis points to the company’s top-line growth.Story continuesBoston Scientific currently expects full-year 2022 operational revenue growth to include a 250-basis-point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021.WATCHMAN, a Long-Term Growth Component: Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum, banking on the strong performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. In the second quarter, WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 17% on a year-over-year basis. Growth accelerated sequentially on a comp-adjusted basis led by strength across regions with a full launch of WATCHMAN FLX in Japan, market share gains in Europe and increased penetration in the United States. Also, the company commenced the first WATCHMAN FLX cases in China, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.DownsidesLegal Hassles: Boston Scientific continues to incur escalating operating costs on its constant involvement in handling serious legal problems. In the second quarter, the operating margin was 13%, including a charge related to ongoing IP litigation.Forex Woes: Boston Scientific remains highly susceptible to unfavorable currency fluctuations. In the second quarter, the company’s total revenues reflected a $130 million or 420-basis point headwind from the foreign exchange due to the strengthened U.S. dollar.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. Boston Scientific participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies and several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $1.76, indicating a 7.9% increase from the 2021 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $12.73 billion, suggesting a 7.1% rise from the 2021 figure.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

That has been felt particularly acutely in parts of Asia and North Africa, where people spend a higher proportion of income on food and fuel than in the United States and Europe, prompting some shoppers to stockpile non-perishable items.The trend hasn't gone unnoticed by Nestle, the world's biggest packaged food company and home to more than 2,000 brands including Cheerios, Nescafe and Maggi.The Swiss group is adapting its product ranges in the region to ""make them more meaningful to the consumer"", and considering whether to make some products ""more affordable"", according to Karim Al Bitar, head of consumer research and market intelligence at Nestle's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) unit.That could include increasing pack sizes and changing to less expensive ingredients.""Nestle is seeing hoarding with bouillon, to an extent soups, coffee for sure,"" Al Bitar told Reuters.Maggi products and Nescafe coffee sachets are among popular products for stockpiling, he added.Nestle is working with local partners to overcome supply challenges and has so far managed to keep stock on shelves, the company said in an emailed statement.The MENA region contributes over 4%, or 3.7 billion Swiss francs ($3.9 billion), to Nestle's annual sales. The region that includes Central Asia accounts for about 9%, or 8 billion francs.STOCK UP, OR PAY MORE LATERStory continuesShoppers are spending less on non-essentials such as electronics, clothes and household goods, while demand for packaged food and personal care items is up, said Hani Weiss, CEO of Majid Al Futtaim Retail, which runs more than 450 Carrefour stores in 16 countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.""What does that tell us that people are concerned about? Stock availability,"" Weiss said, adding the retailer was seeing about 9.5% inflation on average, and particular pressure in countries such as Egypt, Kenya and Georgia.Several countries in North Africa and Central Asia are suffering recurring shortages of basic necessities. Euromonitor International analyst Kamile Botyriute said people in Tunisia, Algeria, Libya and Morocco were having difficulty finding flour, sugar and baked goods. In August, some shops in Tunisia began rationing items to stop consumers from hoarding, Botyriute said.""I have bought about 10 50-kilogram bags of flour and just as much of sugar,"" Eldar, 28, an entrepreneur based in Almaty, Kazakhstan said. ""There are rumors that sugar shortages are expected and I wanted to have a stockpile.""In the same city, Ivan, 47, a furniture designer, said: ""Prices may go up, the dollar (exchange rate) may go up. You start thinking: either I stock up now at current prices or I will have to pay more later.""BILLS, BILLS, BILLSInflation is rising at a faster pace in many Central Asian and North African countries than in North America or Europe, where consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 8.9% in July.Turkey's annual inflation hit a 24-year high of 80% in August, while Egypt's accelerated to 13.6% in July. In many cases, weakening local currencies are adding to import costs.""In Turkey, consumers are adjusting to the reality of extremely high inflation. Despite higher prices, we see consumer demand and market volumes holding up, due partly to pantry loading,"" Unilever CEO Alan Jope said in July.Sinem Ozel, 31, a marketing expert living in Istanbul, has been stocking up on items including oil, toilet paper, pasta, sugar, and dishwasher detergent. She used to spend around 300-400 Turkish liras ($16.71-$22.27) for one month's shopping but now spends the same amount in one week, and sometimes buys Nescafe's three-in-one 20% extra pack of instant coffee.But not everyone can afford to hoard.""We don't have the money to buy large quantities of stuff,"" Layla, a 60-year-old shopper said, standing in front of Lafayette Market in Tunis, Tunisia. ""Most of the time we have to get a loan from relatives to complete the month.""($1 = 18.1455 liras)($1 = 0.9643 Swiss francs) (Reporting by Richa Naidu.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Vertex falls in, has lost 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Vertex is expected to post earnings of $3.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $14.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.07 indicates a change of +6.6% from what Vertex is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Vertex is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VRTX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Vertex, the consensus sales estimate of $2.22 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $8.77 billion and $9.31 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.8% and +6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVertex reported revenues of $2.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.5%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.02%. The EPS surprise was +3.45%.Over the last four quarters, Vertex surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Vertex is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Vertex. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:27% = US$3.2b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.27 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has an impressive ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 23% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 32% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Vertex Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 21%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $51.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure the final 51 Advanced Capabilities Mission Computers retrofit kits to meet the Navy’s mission requirements for the EA-18G aircraft.The majority of the work related to this contract will be executed in Bloomington, MN.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in programs related to a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification work.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Given Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, the company has been witnessing a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime, anywhere and under any conditions.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 25.1% in the past year.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA.Details of the DealValued at $228.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2027. Per the deal, Textron will provide the H-1 Light/Attack helicopter with new and modified capabilities through System Configuration Sets.In particular, as part of this contract, Textron will work on the airframe, aircraft wiring interface terminals, flight controls, and weapon systems interfaces, as well as research alternatives. The company will also offer all efforts required to accomplish an analysis of alternatives, system design, integration, testing, rapid response activities and system capability improvements.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have also been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe bumped-up defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunitions of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to expand at a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This is likely to benefit Textron, with its Bell segment consistently innovating combat helicopters as well as upgrading the existing models to expand in the military rotorcraft market. In March 2022, Bell submitted its final Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) proposal revision to the U.S. Army and expects to receive the contract in October 2022.The growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Story continuesLockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft for U.S. armed forces along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations.

Its military rotorcraft are currently used by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as allied defense forces in over 20 countries across the globe.The Zacks Consensus estimate for Boeing’s 2022 earnings reflects an improvement of 14.8% from 2021 reported figure. BA’s shares have moved up 5.9% in the three months.Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout is a combat-proven, autonomous helicopter system providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target-acquisition, laser designation and battle management for tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets.

(NYSE:WM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Waste Management The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.44bUS$2.67bUS$2.88bUS$3.32bUS$3.57bUS$3.78bUS$3.96bUS$4.11bUS$4.24bUS$4.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.58%Est @ 5.89%Est @ 4.71%Est @ 3.88%Est @ 3.3%Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.1%– 1.9%) = US$107bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$107b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$60bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$85b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$169, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.977. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

606,251e5ae0-cefb-3fc3-967a-c2cda23b67a5,INTU,2022-09-22,Hey Contrarian Investors! 7 Stocks to Buy Before Inflation Falls.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hey-contrarian-investors-7-stocks-103044071.html,1663583444,STORY,"['DIS', 'INTU', 'CTHR', 'PYPL', 'COST']","[With the world’s most powerful central bank committed to tackling soaring prices, it may be time for investors to consider specific stocks to buy for falling inflation.Here’s the reason why forward-looking market participants anticipate lower prices over the next several months. In late August, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered his policy speech at the annual economic symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In it, the central bank leader acknowledged that raising rates to tackle inflation would cause “some pain.” However, not doing anything would lead to bigger problems down the line.More recently, during a question-and-answer session hosted by the Cato Institute, Powell reaffirmed his commitment to controlling inflation. “I can assure you that my colleagues and I are strongly committed to this project and we will keep at it until the job is done,” he declared. That’s a good sign as any that investors should consider stocks to buy for falling inflation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, this thesis is predicated on the Fed lowering prices while not spiraling the economy into a recession. There’s good deflation and then there’s bad deflation. Assuming we receive the former, below are stocks to buy for falling inflation.PYPLPayPal$94.70INTUIntuit$424.30LCIDLucid$16.29COSTCostco$505.50DISDisney$108.69CTHRCharles &amp; Colvard$1.11Z, ZGZillow$34.67, $34.31PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comTake just a brief look at the technical chart for PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and you can recognize the ugly situation it finds itself in. On a year-to-date basis, PYPL has hemorrhaged 50%. Many investors dumped the digital payments specialist because of fears of an impending recession. As well, management had to cut its guidance earlier this year.Nevertheless, PYPL could be one of the stocks to buy for falling inflation. Primarily, getting consumer prices back under control may imply a stabilizing economy: not too hot, not too cold. And stability would be what PayPal needs. Clearly, PayPal caters to those with an entrepreneurial mindset as its underlying business applications present perfect solutions for small businesses. However, nothing freaks out entrepreneurs more than severe economic uncertainty.Story continuesAlso, some analysts are cautiously optimistic about PYPL. “PayPal can continue its outperformance versus the market …but patience is still required,” James Faucette, analyst at Morgan Stanley, stated in a research note.Intuit (INTU)An image of Intuit Turbotax booksSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.comAlong the lines of a stabilizing economy due to declining prices, investors should take a look at Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). The company that gets very popular near (and sometimes on) Tax Day because of its TurboTax software, Intuit also appeals to entrepreneurs thanks to its QuickBooks program. However, shares are down 25% YTD, likely stemming from recessionary fears.After all, if a recession does materialize, there might not be much demand for tax-preparation software.However, assuming the Fed gets circumstances under control without capsizing the economy, INTU represents an intriguing name among stocks to buy for falling inflation. Again, a stable economy – even if prices end up being a tad higher than pre-pandemic norms – presents confidence. Thus, a rise in entrepreneurship could lead to greater demand for Intuit and by logical deduction, INTU stock.If you needed a little more convincing, Gurufocus.com considers Intuit to be “modestly undervalued.” With excellent profitability metrics, long-term contrarians shouldn’t ignore INTU.Lucid (LCID)The Lucid Motors (LCID) Plant in Arizona.Source: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.comAlthough a risky idea among stocks to buy for falling inflation, adventurous contrarians should eyeball Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID). An electric vehicle manufacturer, Lucid distinguishes itself from some other EV upstarts with its focus on premium offerings. Given that regular-sized EVs remain out of reach for the average consumer, Lucid decided to work on the upper-income strata. Eventually, it can work its way down as economies of scale improve.However, skyrocketing prices have put many EV companies in a bind. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new EV earlier this year stood at $62,876. Currently, the cheapest Lucid vehicle starts at $87,400, 39% higher than average.Still, should the Fed succeed in lowering prices, Lucid products could get cheaper. And that will likely expand the company’s total addressable market. Several people have done well during the pandemic so they may be attracted to Lucid’s distinct take on EV luxury. With just a little bit of a discount, the manufacturer could become very enticing.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comWarehouse retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) represents a “cheating” idea for stocks to buy for falling inflation. That’s because the company can respond to either monetary trajectory effectively.A few months ago, I made the case for TipRanks that COST offers an effective hedge against inflation. Under an inflationary cycle, the purchasing power of the dollar declines over time. Therefore, it behooves consumers to buy now and buy in bulk. Popularizing the idea of 800 gallons of mayonnaise, Costco presents an ideal solution for rising prices.However, the retailer should also perform well during deflation. One of the best attributes about Costco is that its consumer base is largely wealthy. In many ways, Costco is a playground for affluent shoppers with plenty of time on their hands. Therefore, a deflationary cycle may inspire upper-middle-class consumers to pick up discounts on previously expensive products.To be sure, deflation will reverse the incentivization profile mentioned earlier. However, that could be more than made up for through increased purchases of bigger-ticket items.Disney (DIS)Statue of Disney's (DIS) Mickey Mouse in Bangkok, Thailand.Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.comFor millions of American families, attending a Disney (NYSE:DIS) theme park represents a vital bonding experience. Unfortunately, inflation has made visiting its famous parks and resorts trickier.According to the Los Angeles Times, “For Disneyland fans, the added food costs come on top of jumps in ticket prices, up as much as 8% last year, and parking, which soared 20%. The new skip-the-line fee, introduced in December 2021, adds $7 to $20 per ride for those who pay it.” Per the LA Times, the culprit is inflation.However, contrarian investors must then ask the question: What if Powell succeeds in taming rising prices without killing the economy? If he manages to pull this balancing act off, Disney could be one of the stocks to buy for falling inflation.Let’s be real. For all the controversies that Disney may generate, it remains an American icon. People want to go to its theme parks and resorts. They just find themselves increasingly priced out. However, a deflationary counterforce could make DIS interesting again.Charles &amp; Colvard (CTHR)A close-up shot of a diamond engagement ring with a rose-gold band.Source: ShutterstockBased in North Carolina, Charles &amp; Colvard (NASDAQ:CTHR) claims to provide the most brilliant moissanite and lab-grown diamond jewelry in the world. However, luxury outfit Charles &amp; Colvard fell under hard times this year because of skyrocketing prices. Since the start of the year, CTHR hemorrhaged a staggering 61% of market value.Therefore, this idea comes with a strong warning. It’s only appropriate for the most risk-tolerant contrarians. However, if that fits your profile, CTHR could be one of the stocks to buy for falling inflation. Primarily, the bullish narrative centers on consumer accessibility.Intuitively, a theory exists that rising economic woes (such as inflation) cause people to delay life events like marriage. And that would logically mean fewer marriage proposals. However, a cycle of declining prices could spark the reverse effect.To be fair, the theory of recessions hurting marriage rates remains hotly debated. However, lower prices would likely be a net positive for a luxury name like Charles &amp; Colvard.Zillow (Z, ZG)The Zillow logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.comConfession time: I have trashed public real-estate firms like Zillow (NASDAQ:Z, NASDAQ:ZG) for the last several months. Honestly, I’m not seeing how a disruptive pandemic and a Federal Reserve committed to raising interest rates to rein in soaring inflation could be positive for the housing market. Still, in keeping with the theme – stocks to buy for falling inflation – let me set aside my personal biases.It’s possible that not everyone with money rushed into last year’s incredible bull market in the housing sector. Some may have smartly set aside the money that Uncle Sam distributed. And the real geniuses probably invested those funds to exponentially grow their wealth. However, if you’re that smart, you probably didn’t want to buy into what looked like a bubble.Therefore, should the Fed help lower costs, Zillow may find itself as one of the stocks to buy for falling inflation. I’m not holding my breath, mind you. But a narrative for bullishness does exist.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Stryker (NYSE:SYK), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Stryker, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$36b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Stryker has an ROCE of 11%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.2% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Stryker roceIn the above chart we have measured Stryker's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Stryker.So How Is Stryker's ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Stryker doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 15% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that Stryker is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 59% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you want to know some of the risks facing Stryker we've found 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.While Stryker may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

However, pricing pressure remains a headwind.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 18.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 44.1% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 19% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $83.5 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 8.8% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 4.25% compares favorably with the industry’s (4.2%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, courtesy of the platform’s unique features, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These, in turn, position it well to sustain momentum in robot sales.The company is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. In the second quarter, the Mako installed base saw 19% year-over-year growth and currently is moving toward 1500 Mako robots. Thus, the company continues to focus on the continued expansion of the platform. This growth reflects the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Taking into account the normalization of the customer environment, management anticipates another strong year for Mako in 2022. The company’s Mako order book remains solid for 2022 and is in sync with its aim of continued share gains in both hips and knees.Additionally, Stryker has a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Its significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped the company stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Stryker’s portfolio includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako robotic-arm assisted surgeries.Story continuesIn September 2021, the company’s Trauma &amp; Extremities division introduced a Citrelock Tendon Fixation Device System, which offers surgeons a differentiated design through a tendon thread featuring Citregen — a resorbable technology. Citregen, in particular, has chemical and mechanical qualities intended for orthopedic surgical applications.Per management, the company’s sustained support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In the first half of 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 7.2% of net sales, highlighting its sustained commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable pricing environment poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. On second-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the period’s average selling days were in line with second-quarter 2021. The impact from pricing was 1.4% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings per share is pegged at $9.38, suggesting growth of 3.2% from 2021. The consensus mark for 2022 revenues stands at $18.31 billion, indicating an improvement of 7.1% from the previous year.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK.

Works To Better Meet the Needs of Multicultural Consumers,News Direct,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whirlpool-corp-works-better-meet-185507485.html,1663786507,STORY,['WHR'],"[Northampton, MA --News Direct-- Whirlpool CorporationWhirlpool Corp. is committed to creating an inclusive culture that embraces the unique differences of its employees—as well as its consumers. The events of the past two years have opened up a much needed conversation about race in the United States, and emphasized how corporations can be more conscious of the needs of the diverse consumers who use their goods and products on a daily basis.“That greater discussion funneled down to a lot of the things that Whirlpool Corporation was doing both externally and with our employees,” says Consumer Insights Director Corey Ross. “It felt like there was a void around our marketing in my view. Although we were working to be more consumer and brand driven, we weren’t focused enough on ensuring our brands had truly authentic connections with Black consumers and more broadly, multicultural consumers.”Ross and his colleagues saw that there was an opportunity to embed Whirlpool Corp.’s core values of inclusion and diversity into every aspect of the consumer journey, including ideation, product development, content and social media buys, as well as service.Ross says, “We asked ourselves: Are we reaching the right influencers to make inroads with multicultural audiences? Are we on the right platforms to reach everyone?”To gain greater insights, the Consumer Insights team, in partnership with Brand and Product Marketing, Whirlpool Corp. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and Global Consumer Design started the Cultural Intelligence Series—a multi-phase qualitative research project aimed at getting immersed collectively in the daily experiences of different cultures.“I wanted to get us in the right line of thinking and imagine walking in their shoes and try to truly understand these consumers at a human level,” says Ross. “Can we feel what they feel, experience what they experience, and get in the right frame of mind as we move forward?”“We spoke to Black consumers, Latin-X consumers, Asian American consumers, as well as LGBTQ+ consumers. We have also moved into focusing on other groups as well, such as consumers with disabilities.”Story continuesThe goal was to do deep dives, less specifically about appliances, but more into what these consumers experience on a day-to-day basis. The research was a mix of different methodologies to try and extract insights about their lives, their experiences and how they feel about brands connecting with their culture.“So it was about getting connected to people from a day-to-day standpoint of how they manage their home, interactions with family and friends, their work—all those sorts of things—and how each comes into play in their lives and shapes how brands can become emotionally connected to them,” Ross explains.The research covers all categories of appliances that the company sells, from the kitchen to the laundry room.“The richness of our knowledge is vast around consumer usage of our products,” says Whirlpool Corp. Laundry VP Anna Utley. “We seek not just to meet broad use cases, but also the unique and personalized needs of individual consumers.”Creating a broader, more inclusive narrative for their outreach to consumers was important for the different brands within the company’s North American portfolio, which include Whirlpool, Maytag, Amana, JennAir and KitchenAid brands.“We went forward with the idea of removing the biases and removing any assumptions that we previously might have had,” says Ross. “We can’t stop at just putting Black American talent in a commercial. We have to be engaged in multiple culturally relevant touch points, particularly with younger audiences, to continue to build trust with our brands beyond our products.”All of the work done ladders up to Whirlpool Corp.’s vision of improving life at home for its consumers.“In building our product pipelines, we can now dive deeper into how the laundry and kitchen journeys vary across households and make decisions so we can meet a broad array of diverse and dynamic consumer needs,” says Utley.Ross echoes this sentiment. “We also need to make sure that we’re putting the right level of investment of time and resources towards these groups, because we know they’re demanding more personalization, they’re demanding more from their brands, and they’re expecting brands to truly value their communities and culture—not just their dollars.”View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/whirlpool-corp-works-to-better-meet-the-needs-of-multicultural-consumers-622512237]"

618,9ecb8220-d455-316d-be49-a298eaf8538d,SRE,2022-09-22,Newly Approved Legislation Aims to Prevent Power Outages and Fires by Phasing in Non-Conductive Foil Balloon Material,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newly-approved-legislation-aims-prevent-164500919.html,1663778700,STORY,['SRE'],"[AB 847 signed by governor stems from collaboration between Assemblymember Quirk and SDG&amp;ESAN DIEGO, September 21, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Each year, electrically-conductive foil balloons – popular for celebrating birthdays, graduations and other special occasions – cause thousands of power outages across California and the nation when they get tangled up in power lines. Occasionally, foil balloons caught in power lines also spark fires and bring down electrical wires. (See this dramatic footage of a foil balloon in power lines. Additional video and photos available for download here.)To help reduce fire risk and prevent power outages, manufacturers and retail outlets in California will be required to gradually phase in the production and sale of non-electrically conductive foil balloons in the coming years. This change is prompted by new legislation signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and sponsored by Assemblymember Bill Quirk (D-Hayward) in collaboration with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.""Balloon safety can go a long way in preventing power outages and fires,"" said Assemblymember Quirk, D-Hayward. ""With California facing increasing wildfire risks and electric reliability challenges due to climate change, it’s important that we do everything we can to mitigate fire risk and prevent power interruption.""Under Assembly Bill 847 signed by the governor on Sept. 18, anyone who sells and makes any foil balloon for sale is required to ensure that those balloons meet certain requirements, including passing a standard test (IEEE 2845) that is approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Per the legislation, non-electrically conductive foil balloons will be phased in over several years, after the IEEE approves the final standard for testing non-conductive foil balloons or by Jan. 1, 2027, whichever is later.""Our top priority at SDG&amp;E is to provide safe and reliable service to our customers,"" said SDG&amp;E CEO Caroline Winn. ""That’s why our engineers persisted over the past decade to develop an innovative balloon material that looks just like a regular foil balloon but doesn’t cause outages or increase fire risk – solving an industry-wide problem.""Story continuesSeeking to solve the conductivity issue with metallic balloons while still allowing foil balloons to remain a consumer product, SDG&amp;E worked with a leading U.S. balloon manufacturer, Anagram, to develop and test a balloon made of non-conductive, shiny material. This balloon was successfully tested in conditions common to SDG&amp;E’s, Southern California Edison’s (SCE), and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric’s (PG&amp;E) electrical distribution systems.In SDG&amp;E’s service territory, existing foil balloons cause around 100 power outages each year and have sparked an average of 3 to 4 reportable fires every year from 2015 to 2021. In fact, over the six years, SDG&amp;E recorded over 700 outages and 28 reportable fires all due to foil balloons coming into contact with overhead power lines. This happens because the metallic exterior of the foil balloon conducts electricity, so when it floats into an overhead power line the balloon can cause an electrical fault, blackouts, or worse, sparks that can start fires. Elsewhere in California, PG&amp;E reported that metallic balloons that drifted into its power lines caused more than 600 outages in 2021, a 27% increase from the previous year and the highest number of balloon-related outages the company has seen in a decade. In 2021, SCE recorded 1,103 outages caused by metallic balloons that impacted 1.6 million customers for 7,630 hours.SDG&amp;E is an innovative San Diego-based energy company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The company is committed to creating a sustainable future by providing its electricity from renewable sources; modernizing natural gas pipelines; accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles; supporting numerous non-profit partners; and, investing in innovative technologies to ensure the reliable operation of the region’s infrastructure for generations to come.

619,7efa9a70-febf-35e3-8d31-249b05c92cea,SRE,2022-09-22,Why Sempra (SRE) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-sempra-sre-top-dividend-154503785.html,1663688703,STORY,['SRE'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Sempra in FocusBased in San Diego, Sempra (SRE) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 30.73%. The natural gas and electricity provider is paying out a dividend of $1.14 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.65% compared to the Utility - Gas Distribution industry's yield of 2.85% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.69%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.58 is up 4.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Sempra has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.18%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Sempra's current payout ratio is 52%. This means it paid out 52% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for SRE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.65 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 2.61%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SRE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

620,be98e827-3d05-3631-9f80-3f1bfd63f6f4,SRE,2022-09-22,"Sempra (NYSE:SRE) most popular amongst individual investors who own 56% of the shares, institutions hold 44%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempra-nyse-sre-most-popular-140025423.html,1663682425,STORY,['SRE'],"[A look at the shareholders of Sempra (NYSE:SRE) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 56% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Meanwhile, institutions make up 44% of the company’s shareholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sempra. See our latest analysis for Sempra ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sempra?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Sempra does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sempra's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sempra. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 4.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 4.4% and 3.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SempraThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Sempra insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$18m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 56% of Sempra shares. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Sempra   (of which 3 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Sumitomo Corp. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while General Electric has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SSUMY has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.SSUMY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.01, while GE has a forward P/E of 24.50. We also note that SSUMY has a PEG ratio of 1.97. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. GE currently has a PEG ratio of 3.50.Another notable valuation metric for SSUMY is its P/B ratio of 0.61. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

This is impacting the company’s free cash flow. Happe expects GE’s free cash flow to be in line with the second-quarter reported figure of $162 million or slightly better.Shortage of raw materials and labor is weighing on the Aerospace segment, while the HealthCare segment is seeing reduced output due to supply-chain constraints.

To tackle the supply-chain woes, the company is focusing on pricing actions, controlling costs and improving cash.General Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company price | General Electric Company QuoteIn the second quarter of 2022, supply-chain constraints led to a decline in revenues from Commercial Engines (part of the Aerospace segment).

For the third quarter of 2022, management expects General Electric’s organic revenues to increase in mid-single digits.General Electric is on track to spin-off its healthcare business into a new public company in early 2023.

This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only US$5.1m.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric General Electric Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp for US$4.8m worth of shares, at about US$75.26 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$67.05. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$5.7m for 75.54k shares. But insiders sold 1.44k shares worth US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. General Electric insiders own about US$179m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Electric Tell Us?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PBF Energy PBF, Valero Energy VLO and Phillips 66 PSX.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Time to Buy These 3 Refinery Stocks Swamped by Oil's FallOil prices logged their third weekly fall in a row on Friday, dragged down by familiar fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth. Futures in New York settled at $85.11 a barrel, while Brent — the international benchmark — closed at $91.35. Both contracts have lost around 20% so far this quarter.With most Oil/Energy stocks highly dependent on commodity prices, it is no surprise that the pullback has resulted in downward pressure on the sector components. But based on fundamentals, experts see this negative price action as a transient stoppage in an otherwise strong energy environment, which continues to enjoy support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine.In particular, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry seems to be one sub-sector that has become an unfortunate casualty of this oil slide. Even as fuel product supply remains constrained due to capacity rationalization triggered by the pandemic and demand continues to show strength on the pent-up desire for travel, some of the largest downstream companies have dropped precipitously over the past few weeks.    In other words, this presents a compelling buying opportunity in top-ranked refining stocks like PBF Energy, Valero Energy and Phillips 66.Refining &amp; Marketing Industry DriversWith the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, crude has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Story continuesAs it is, the downstream companies have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing vaccinations and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 6% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.As economic activity remains quite hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners have also benefited from increased summer driving and accelerating international travel.The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) have set all-time highs. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high.Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Buy the DipAll this adds up to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing group currently carrying a Zacks Industry Rank #8 — placing it in the top 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The group’s excellent position indicates fairly strong near-term prospects for its constituent companies.With the refining outlook looking up, savvy investors could use the pullback as an opportunity to buy their favorite stocks at a discount. We have narrowed down our search to three companies that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) but are down at least 7% over the past month.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, this Zacks Rank #1 firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products.

PBF Energy beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 78%.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO’s refining plants are located in the Gulf coast area, from where there is easy access to the export facilities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Valero’s 2022 earnings has been revised 11.7% upward over the past 60 days. VLO, headquartered in San Antonio, TX, has a projected earnings growth rate of 878.7% for 2022. It has a Zacks Rank #2.Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength.

Awards of about 218 million barrels for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 have tamed market worries and cut energy prices.But they have slashed the reserve to 427.2 million barrels - or about four weeks of demand - the lowest level in about 38 years. This has sparked criticism because some oil was resold to buyers overseas. A few distributions came under congressional mandates while others are pending.The two biggest receivers acquired nearly 98 million barrels so far. Valero, the second largest U.S. refiner by capacity, secured 52.7 million, while top oil processor Marathon Petroleum snapped up 45.2 million barrels.Other big buyers included Exxon Mobil, with 24.7 million barrels, Motiva Enterprises at 22.1 million, Shell at 15.2 million and Phillips 66 at 16 million.Marathon Petroleum declined to comment on crude sourcing. Other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comments.(Graphic: Valero, Marathon Petroleum secure most crude from U.S. emergency stash, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-OIL/SPR/zdpxombwgvx/chart.png)Some of the barrels were exported by Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66, TotalEnergies' trading unit Atlantic Trading and Marketing as well as Unipec, an arm of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec, according to U.S. Customs data.Most of the oil was sold via auctions at prices determined by a five-day average around the date of delivery. A smaller quantity was exchanged and typically requires receivers to replace the oil with a slightly larger volume.Story continuesAbout 24.42 million barrels were released by exchange, with the largest amounts taken by Exxon and Shell.The SPR will be replenished via contracts to purchase oil in the future at fixed, preset prices.

636,a67b0e2c-ce88-386d-b163-bb7e19f4aa8b,VLO,2022-09-22,Valero Energy Corporation's (NYSE:VLO) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financial Prospects Look Decent: Is The Market Wrong?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporations-nyse-vlo-140950727.html,1663682990,STORY,['VLO'],"[With its stock down 12% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Valero Energy's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:32% = US$7.4b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.32 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 32% ROETo begin with, Valero Energy has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 26% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. For this reason, Valero Energy's five year net income decline of 20% raises the question as to why the high ROE didn't translate into earnings growth. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Valero Energy's performance with the industry and found thatValero Energy's performance is depressing even when compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 3.4% in the same period, which is a slower than the company.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is VLO fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Valero Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Valero Energy's declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 56% (or a retention ratio of 44%). With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely.Additionally, Valero Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 49% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, Valero Energy's ROE is speculated to decline to 14% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Valero Energy certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. Additionally, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that analysts expect the company's earnings to continue to shrink in the future. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.Have feedback on this article?

637,a9607ddf-933a-35ef-8fd4-949f73caf3ba,VLO,2022-09-22,Dive Into DuPont Analysis & Pick 5 Top Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dive-dupont-analysis-pick-5-122112912.html,1663676472,STORY,"['GWW', 'BCC', 'DD', 'VLO']","[Return on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and the capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierThe screener yields winning stocks like Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), UFP Industries (UFPI), Valero Energy (VLO), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and J Boise Cascade (BCC).Why Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of nine stocks that made it through the screen:Sprouts Farmers Market SFM: This currently Zacks Rank #2 player operates in a highly fragmented grocery store industry with a unique model that features fresh produce, foods section and a vitamin department focused on overall wellness. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of SFM for the last four quarters is 15.64%.UFP Industries UFPI: The presently Zacks Rank #1 player is a holding company with subsidiaries throughout North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

At the same time, the Dow lost 1.01%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.07%.Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. health insurer had lost 3.86% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 4.89% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 7.59% in that time.UnitedHealth Group will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 14, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.45, up 20.58% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $80.71 billion, up 11.58% from the prior-year quarter.UNH's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $21.85 per share and revenue of $322.11 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +14.88% and +12%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

With financing options in the mix to help make that care more affordable.Change Healthcare leverages information and analytics to improve the delivery of care and the overall payment processes as we noted earlier this week. The company notes on its site that, among other things, the analytics can help “automate provider contracts to help reduce costs and improve efficiency.”The data, per Change, helps with scheduling in a proactive manner. And in reference to payments, the company also offers financial clearing services that can help patients find funding sources to help pay their medical bills — which in turn helps providers reduce bad debt.In this way, the continuum of care and the financing of that care is improved through an ongoing digital transformation, with active engagement between providers and patients, with outcomes-based care a guiding principle.The United deal to buy Change serves as an illustration of the trends that are firmly in place in the Connected Economy — where consumers access care across digital and in-person channels.As proof positive, consider the findings from the study “Omnichannel Healthcare Takes Center Stage,” done in collaboration between PYMNTS and CareCredit. In that study, responses from more than 2,700 consumers found that roughly half of those individuals use a range of channels to get the care they need.But paying for care remains daunting — so much so that, in a separate PYMNTS/CareCredit report,  “The Payment Cure: How Improving Billing Experiences Impacts Patient Loyalty,” 33% of patients surveyed said they did not get needed healthcare, mostly citing the inability to pay. And we found, too, that 41% of users of alternative healthcare payment plans said they “helped them manage their other bills or expenses.” The awareness of and desire to use financing is significant as 45% of all patients queried said they would be interested in using those options.]"

(NASDAQ:ADP). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Automatic Data Processing’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Is Automatic Data Processing Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 16% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Automatic Data Processing today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $279.81, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Furthermore, Automatic Data Processing’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from Automatic Data Processing?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 37% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Automatic Data Processing. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ADP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Procter &amp; Gamble. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Procter &amp; Gamble already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Procter &amp; Gamble's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Procter &amp; Gamble. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$213m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 35% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Procter &amp; Gamble has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Obviously, there’s a lot more to consider but, as a starting point for the serious long-term investor, these below-book and dividend-paying REITs may be worth looking at.Annaly Capital Management Inc.

661,426cc8d5-228c-3362-a6ad-40eafbaebdbf,DHI,2022-09-22,Builder Confidence Still Below 50 in September: Will it Regain?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/builder-confidence-still-below-50-160804765.html,1663690084,STORY,"['DHI', 'TMHC', 'TOL', 'LEN-B', 'MTH', 'KBH', 'PHM']","[According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo’s Housing Market Index (HMI), sentiment among U.S. homebuilders for newly-built single-family homes slipped to the lowest level since May 2020 in September. Barring the readings for April and May of 2020 (when HMI fell to 30 and 37, respectively), the September 2022 reading of 46 marks the lowest level since May 2014.A score below 50 indicates poor industry conditions in most builders’ view.Persistent supply-chain disruptions, moderate inventory levels and higher material costs are hurting homebuilders’ confidence levels. As a result, homebuilders are increasing prices regularly, leading to affordability issues.High home prices, above 6% mortgage rates and back-to-back interest rate hikes make it difficult for entry-level and first-time buyers to indulge in such activity. The Fed is likely to conduct another meeting this week and may announce the biggest interest rate hike. Since March, it has lifted the rate from near zero to 2.25-2.50%, currently.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has declined 22.9% in a year, underperforming the Zacks Construction sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s fall of 17.7% and 12.4%, respectively.Ninth Straight Month Fall of Confidence, Housing Slowness PersistFor this month, all three HMI components fell sequentially. Current sales conditions decreased three points to 54. Both buyer traffic and sales prediction for the next six months fell one point to 31 and 46, respectively. The HMI gauge of tepid future sales expectation signals slow housing demand this year.NAHBImage Source: NAHBThe three-month moving averages for the regional HMI reading were also down in each region. Northeast dropped five points from the prior month to 51. Midwest fell five points to 44, South fell seven points to 56 and West declined a notable 10-point to 41.NAHB chairman, Jerry Konter, a home builder and developer from Savannah, Ga, stated, “Buyer traffic is weak in many markets as more consumers remain on the sidelines due to high mortgage rates and home prices that are putting a new home purchase out of financial reach for many households.” Konter added, “In another indicator of a weakening market, 24% of builders reported reducing home prices, up from 19% last month.”This year, homebuilders have loosened confidence month over month. Since January, it has declined 37 points now, supporting the signs of a housing recession, thanks to elevated construction costs and an aggressive monetary policy. The declining trend has provoked more than half of the builders to think about incentives like mortgage rate buydowns, free amenities and price reductions to boost sales.Story continuesWill Housing Regain Momentum?Per the market pundits, housing is unlikely to regain this year as the prevailing market condition is not showing signs of recovery. Recently, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported in its Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey, for the week ending Sep 9, that activity declined to the lowest level since December 1999 from the previous week. Activities will decline more in the future as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has gone up to 6.02% for the week ending Sep 15, marking the highest reading since 2008 and essentially double the year-ago figure.In addition to the above-mentioned data, inflation rose 0.6% after adjusting for energy sources, and prices of building materials rose 0.5% in August from July. These factors are enough to setback from housing activities.Leading homebuilders like Lennar Corporation LEN, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, KB Home KBH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, Meritage Homes Corporation MTH and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL have witnessed lower order and backlog during their last reported quarter and has reduced their expectation for second-half 2022.Although these stocks have gained 3.54%, 3.33%, 3.17%, 2.77%, 2.61%, 2.38% and 2.11%, respectively on Sep 19, the tepidness persist.A Brief Outlook of Above-Mentioned StocksLennar, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company, is about to post its quarterly numbers on Sep 21.

The research, conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research and released today, examines how well a market’s respective government, financial system, and employers provide relevant tools, services, and guidance to enable greater levels of financial inclusion.“Financial inclusion is foundational to global economic progress. As an organization focused on helping more people gain access to financial security, we believe inclusion is an integral component of a market’s ability to prepare for and recover from adversity, grow sustainably, and build a brighter future,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president, and CEO for Principal®. “The Global Financial Inclusion Index provides a rigorous, data-driven framework to track financial inclusion on a global scale. Through this we can identify the structural gaps in financial inclusivity and take steps to address them, along with many others, to help build a more productive and protected workforce and society.”The Index examines 42 markets and scores them across three pillars — government support, financial system support, and employer support — using datapoints across public and survey-based sources.The government support pillar examines the degree to which governments promote and enable financial inclusion, considering data on public pension support, deposit and consumer protections, employment, education, and financial literacy levels, and online connectivity.The financial system support pillar reviews the availability and uptake of various financial products, services, and education, considering data on access to bank accounts and credit, maturation of financial technology and use of real-time payments, and the overall effectiveness of the financial services industry in promoting confidence and small to medium sized business growth.The employer support pillar evaluates the availability and impact of employer programs to improve employee financial wellbeing and inclusion across various dimensions such as employee pension contributions, employee insurance programs, and financial guidance.Story continuesIn its first year, the Index is helping to develop a benchmark for financial security and inclusion across global economies.Key findingsIn general, developed economies tend to pool towards the higher end of the Index, and emerging and developing economies cluster at the bottom. Six of the top 10 markets for financial inclusion are European and, within this group, four are Nordic. Europe’s larger economies rank at the bottom of the table, with Italy as a particular outlier at 37th. The lower half of the ranking consists mainly of countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. Argentina ranks last.Economies that provide strong support from their government and financial system tend to provide a lower level of employer support – and the reverse is also true. Developed economies typically score well for government and financial system support, whereas emerging economies generally score better for employer support.When considering this research on an investment basis, the markets analyzed can be broadly grouped into four categories – mature, forward-looking economies; mature, backward-looking economies; young, forward-looking economies; and reliant economies – each of which provides an indication of several of the short-, medium- and long-term risks to which economies are exposed. There are some outliers to these categories – primarily some of the largest economies including the U.S., China, and India – which do not fit neatly into a single category.The findings suggest financial inclusion may be a powerful indicator of next generation capital and wealth markets globally. When performance in each pillar is strong, it helps promote business growth and confidence and may lead to accelerated development of a capital market. These three pillars can provide insights into its overall economic maturity and development of a market and suggest ways to drive progress.Markets which rank highly for financial inclusion tend to also perform well on other societal factors such as food security, productivity, economic and social resilience, standards of living, and climate change adaption. There are strong, positive correlations between the Index rankings and the rankings of markets in several other indices which track the key factors affecting global populations today.“The Index provides a data-driven, horizontal view for developed and emerging markets to learn from each other when it comes to fostering a financially inclusive citizenry,” said Kay Neufeld, head of forecasting and thought leadership at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. “We tracked the Index against metrics that follow some of the most significant trends facing society today – like food insecurity and climate change – and recognized a clear relationship between financial inclusion and those factors that contribute to a successful society.” Top 10 Scoring Markets Bottom 10 Scoring Markets1Singapore (68.9)33Turkey (36.1)2United States (68.334South Africa (34.1)3Sweden (65.4)35Brazil (33.9)4Hong Kong (65.1)36Mexico (33.3)5Finland (64.7)37Italy (32.8)6Denmark (63.9)38Peru (32.7)7Australia (63.6)39Colombia (32.2)8Switzerland (63.4)40Nigeria (26.9)9Norway (63.1)41Ghana (22.2)10The Netherlands (59.8)42Argentina (19.2)To read the full report and methodology, please click here.To view a summary infographic, please click here.About Principal Financial Group®Principal Financial Group® (Nasdaq: PFG) is a global financial company with 18,500 employees1 passionate about improving the wealth and well-being of people and businesses.

Structurally, the Index is split into three pillars (government, financial system, employer support) which in turn consist of a varying number of indicators.An indicator can consist of a single or multiple variables derived from a combination of publicly available quantitative data sources and survey-based data. The data points are combined to provide an indicator score, subsequent pillar score, and headline Index ranking.Scores for each market are generated based on its performance as measured by the particular indicator. For each indicator, Cebr follows the same set of steps, assigning a value between 0 and 100 to each market. The values are relative to each other.In order to account for outliers, we check each data point to determine if it falls outside of the mean +/- 2 standard deviations (SD) range. If it does, the market is assigned a value equal to either mean + 2 SD or mean – 2 SD.For each indicator, scores are normalized within a range from 0 to 100. Given that a higher overall Index score indicates better performance, for indicators and sub-indicators where a lower figure signifies a better performance (e.g., estimates for informal employment output), the inverse of the data point or its negative equivalent is used.Once scores are assigned between 0 and 100 to each market for each indicator based on the previous steps, the indicators are weighted to calculate the overall pillar score. These are then aggregated into the overall Index score.Here, our default approach is to use an equal weighting for indicators and pillars, e.g., given that the Index has three pillars, each should receive a weight of 33%. However, there are cases when it can be justified to deviate from this default assumption. With the Index, we employed a weighted approach to give greater weight to the government and financial system support pillars.This is because the employer support pillar is based exclusively on survey data. While the survey data is an important part of the data inputs required for the Index, Cebr acknowledged that the information based on robust secondary data sources should be attributed a greater weight, as it is more likely to reflect an objective assessment of the respective measures.

676,02521bd5-b21a-3c55-b21d-1db57b976996,AWK,2022-09-22,7 Water Stocks With the Highest Dividends to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-water-stocks-highest-dividends-174231884.html,1663522951,STORY,"['AOS', 'AWR', 'XYL', 'MLI', 'WTRG', 'AWK', 'GRC']","[In this article, I’ll be looking at some water stocks with dividends. These stocks don’t have the highest dividends in the market, but they offer among the highest payouts in the sector.Aside from water stocks’ dividends, however, there are several reasons to consider investing in the sector. To begin with, water is a commodity that will always be needed. This is particularly true because water crises are emerging in several countries, including the United States. In several Western states, a multi-year drought may necessitate government restricting water use by up to 25%.And like many commodity stocks, a key reason to invest in water stocks is their reliable dividends. In volatile markets, it’s always a good idea to invest in companies that pay you to own their stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd then, there’s the current “risk-off” environment. In light of all of these factors, you can see why water stocks with dividends are in a sweet spot between growth and value. Many of these stocks are outperforming the market simply because of the laws of supply and demand.So if you’re looking for some income during your retirement or you just want to find some stocks to combat the market’s current volatility, here are seven water stocks that are worth a look.AWKAmerican Water Works$148.40WTRGEssential Utilities$45.57AWRAmerican States Water Company$85.79MLIMueller Industries$59.67GRCGorman-Rupp$25.43AOSA.O. Smith$51.72XYLXylem$93.26American Water Works (AWK)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockWhen investors look for water stocks with dividends, utilities are a good place to start. American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is one of the leading water utilities in the country. The company’s current dividend yield is 1.77%.That’s not particularly impressive, but it’s good.The company currently pays its stock’s owners $2.62 per share on an annual basis. That’s 44% higher than the sector average.Story continuesAnd when it comes to the balance sheet, there’s a lot to like as well. The company has a profit margin of 3.99% which is almost twice the sector’s average. And with a price–earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 20 times, the valuation of AWK stock is becoming more attractive.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comThe next company on my list is not a pure-play water utility. That’s because, in addition to the water services that it provides through municipalities and other parties, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) also has exposure to the natural gas sector. That adds some volatility to WTRG stock, but it’s still one of the best names for income-oriented investors.The company pays $1.15 per share of dividends annually. That currently equates to a 2.5% dividend yield. Indicating that the company’s dividend is safe, WTRG is in the exclusive Dividend Aristocrat club, as  it has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years.And at a time when investors are looking for growth wherever they can get it, Essential Utilities is a solid choice. The company’s balance sheet is sound, and it continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth.In fact, over the next five years, Essential Utilities is projecting high single-digit-percentage growth in both metrics. That’s a combination that should allow Essential Utilities to continue increasing its dividend over time.American States Water Company (AWR)Several new gray valves, for water or gas, lie on the floor at the factory. The valves are gray for water or gas at the factory of the manufacturerSource: Dmitrii Pridannikov / Shutterstock.comAnother utility company on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends is American States Water Company (NYSE:AWR). About 25% of its customer base is in California. Specifically, the company serves over 250,000 customers in the Golden State, making it one of the state’s largest water utility companies.AWR stock has advanced at an average annual rate of approximately 15% over the last five years. And as of the market close on September 15, the stock was up 21% since bottoming in June.The company is projecting single-digit-percentage revenue and earnings growth over the next five years. That should be enough to satisfy dividend investors.American States Water is a Dividend King that has increased its payout for the last 62 consecutive years. And there’s little reason to believe that the streak will be interrupted.Mueller Industries (MLI)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comIf investing in a company that is undervalued but growing appeals to you, you’ll love my next stock. Mueller Industries (NASDAQ:MLI) is the first water stock on this list that is not a water utility. However, the company is vital to water infrastructure. The company makes pipes, valves, and fittings for commercial and residential applications.In its most recent reported quarter, Mueller generated record revenue of $1.15 billion. And the company reported a healthy backlog. Meanwhile, its balance sheet is more than fine, as it has zero net debt and continues to increase its free cash flow.Also making the shares attractive is that investors can still buy MLI stock at an attractive P/E ratio of just over five times earnings. Plus, the company pays an annual dividend of $1.00 and has increased its dividend by approximately 9% annually over the last three years.Gorman-Rupp (GRC)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comLike many companies in this sector, Gorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC) is an established name. The company has been making pumps and pumping systems for its customers since 1933. And today, the firm has a global presence as it generates about one-third of its revenue outside the United States.About 58% of the company’s revenue comes from water and water-related products. Investors can count on the specialized firm to generate steady revenue and earnings . Throughout its history, Gorman-Rupp has grown through acquisition, but that hasn’t stopped it from issuing dividends for the last 72 years.That payout by itself would make the stock worth including on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends. However, for the last 49 years, Gorman-Rupp has increased its dividend, putting it on the cusp of being a Payout King.A.O. Smith (AOS)A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comA.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) is one of the country’s leading manufacturers of boilers, water treatment products and water heaters. In June 2022, InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth gave AOS stock a ringing endorsement, calling it one of his favorite stocks to buy.At that time, the company had just acquired Atlantic Filter Corporation. The water treatment company was A.O. Smith’s fifth such acquisition since 2016. Water treatment is becoming a key niche, and A.O. Smith appears to be committed to grabbing a substantial share of the market.AOS  has some work to do. That may be why the company is looking to grow its water heater business in China and India.  In the meantime, investors can enjoy the company’s dividend which pays out $1.12 on an annual basis. That works out to a yield of 2.17%.Xylem (XYL)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockThe last stock on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends is a company that’s using technology to address the emerging issue of water scarcity. Xylem (NYSE:XYL) claims that within the next three years, 1.8 billion people will be living in areas without sufficient water.To that end, the company delivers hundreds of innovative and smart technology solutions. The company specializes in fixing leaky pipes.While that may sound unimportant, it’s becoming  an increasingly prevalent problem because of our country’s aging water infrastructure. In fact, the average water main in the U. S. hasn’t been replaced since the 1970s.XYL stock is down 21% for the year, but it’s been rallying since June. As of September 15, 2022 XYL has posted a 29% gain.The company’s revenue should remain solid as the nation upgrades its aging infrastructure. Consequently expect Xylem’s dividend to continue to increase.  It currently pays the owners of XYL $1.20 annually, and the payout has been growing at an average rate of 10% over the last three years.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

(NYSE:FCX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$42b last week after a 4.3% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 1.1% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Freeport-McMoRan which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Freeport-McMoRan. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Freeport-McMoRan?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Freeport-McMoRan does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Freeport-McMoRan, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Freeport-McMoRan. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.8% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Freeport-McMoRanWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$177m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Freeport-McMoRan. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Freeport-McMoRan better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Freeport-McMoRan  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.Ultimately the future is most important.

High input costs, including the cost of raw materials, packaging and logistics, are a common concern plaguing margins. Also, a tight labor market has led to a spike in wage costs. These headwinds have been weighing on companies’ performances.Amid such a scenario, the Consumer Staples sector – popularly known as the defensive zone – has been garnering attention. This is because demand for staples remains fairly stable when compared with discretionary categories, aiding companies in the space to withstand market turbulence. Even in the early phases of the pandemic, which had messed up operations of companies across most industries, players in the consumer staples space were riding on the burgeoning demand for essentials stemming from elevated at-home consumption and stock hoarding.No wonder the defensive Consumer Staples sector has always been a go-to place for investors, as it offers steady growth irrespective of the state of the economy. Adding stocks from the consumer staples basket lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market. These stocks make up for modest growth with dependable profits, lower price volatility and defensive positioning.All said, we have picked a few stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples universe, which are well-positioned for growth on the back of their robust fundamentals and favorable demand.

On the bright side the returns have been quite good over the last half decade. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 85% in that time.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Union Pacific managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 13% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Union Pacific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Union Pacific the TSR over the last 5 years was 105%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Union Pacific has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 11% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 15% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Those cuts mainly in Gap San Francisco, New York, and Asia offices across a range of departments. And the move comes after the company ended its partnership with Kanye West last week and as it continues to look for a new permanent CEO. Bob Martin filling that role on an interim basis.But it also comes as the company has really struggled to maintain any kind of sales increases here in this environment. Old Navy, which had been the strong brand within the portfolio, has been also not doing great.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, this is significant. And it'll be interesting in terms of the different categories that they look across or the different job functions specifically within Gap, given all of those subsidiaries that they do have. And where that restructuring perhaps even in the future and that frame of mind may kind of persist and take place.Looking at some of the brands that have been doing well, Banana Republic, sure, yeah, had a good past two quarters. But even going forward from now, I think so much of the fanfare has still been around, OK, Athleta, what are you going to do to really beef up that brand? And then on the other side, how are you going to get Old Navy back into good graces with consumers? And that is where the strategic approach should be lying for company in Gap too.]"

Vladimir Putin rattles the nuclear saber as he calls up 300,000 reservists for his war in Ukraine, causing the dollar and European gas prices to rise again. Existing home sales are due, and homebuilder Lennar reports quarterly earnings. In the U.K., Prime Minister Liz Truss prepares another energy relief package, and the U.S. government will publish its weekly oil inventories as fears for global oil demand grow. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 21st September.1. Decision Day at the FedThe Federal Reserve is set to raise U.S. interest rates again, with the market split over whether to expect an increase of 75 basis points, as happened last time, or a full percentage point. Another upside surprise to U.S. inflation in August has inclined some analysts to the latter, although the consensus is still - just about - for 75.Of more importance, arguably, will be the Fed's so-called 'dot-plot', which maps where the policymakers expect rates to be over the next couple of years. This should send a signal about how high the central bank thinks rates will have to rise, and how long they will have to stay high before victory over inflation can be declared. Short-term interest rate futures imply a peak next year of between 4.25% and 4.5%, i.e., around 2 percentage points higher than today.The Fed's decision is due as usual at 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT), with chair Jerome Powell's press conference half an hour later.2. Putin ups the ante with partial mobilizationRussian President Vladimir Putin surprised the West Wednesday by declaring a partial mobilization of the country's 2-million-strong military reserve and confirming his intention to annex those parts of Ukraine currently under Russian occupation.Putin said the mobilization would be limited to those who have already served in the armed forces and who have relevant experience and training. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a subsequent televised address that it would only affect 300,000 people.Story continuesThe move marks a massive shift for the Kremlin and could be seen as a response to recent defeats on the battlefield in Ukraine and signs that its leverage over European energy markets may be fading as European gas prices fall.3. Stocks set to open higher; home sales data, Gap job cuts eyedU.S. stock markets are set to open moderately higher despite the drama in Russia but are essentially in a holding pattern ahead of the Fed meeting later.By 06:40 ET, Dow Jones futures were up 70 points, or 0.2%, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were largely flat. The three benchmark cash indices had lost around 1% each on Tuesday in a bout of pre-Fed jitters.Stocks likely to be in focus later include homebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN), which reports results on the same day that existing home sales data for August are due. General Mills (NYSE:GIS) is also due to report. Also in focus is Gap (NYSE:GPS), which is to cut 500 corporate jobs, according to a Wall Street Journal report.4. U.K. energy bailout and Uniper nationalizationThe U.K.'s new Prime Minister Liz Truss announced a relief package for businesses to help them with their energy bills over the coming winter. The package will cap electricity and gas prices at around half of the current spot market price for six months. A more selective relief scheme will then be applied thereafter.The move, with an estimated cost of 40 billion pounds ($45.5 billion) is the second big fiscal package announced by Truss to deal with the energy crisis. The pound fell to a new 37-year low in response, spooked by data published earlier showing a big rise in public borrowing due to higher interest costs.Europe’s energy crisis meanwhile claimed another victim in Germany, where the federal government agreed to nationalize Uniper (ETR:UN01), the country’s biggest gas supplier, whose finances have been ruined by the shut-off of Russian supplies.Elsewhere, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire asked the EU to bring forward a planned loosening of state aid rules to help businesses get through the winter.5. Oil surges on the Putin factor; EIA data awaitedCrude oil prices rose sharply as the market moved to price in a higher geopolitical risk premium after Putin’s speech.By 06:40 ET, U.S. crude futures were up 2.4% at $85.95 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 2.3% at $92.74 a barrel.Nuclear grandstanding aside, the big item of the day is U.S. inventory data for last week, where a 2.16 million barrel increase in crude stocks is expected. The American Petroleum Institute’s data, released on Tuesday, undershot expectations with a build of just over 1 million barrels.Related ArticlesFed Decision, Putin Mobilizes, Home Sales - What's Moving MarketsUK short-dated gilt yields highest since 2008 ahead of BoE, FedIndia's RBI announces 500 billion rupee overnight repo]"

Last week, the Yeezy Gap strategy collapsed, with Kanye West’s Yeezy brand ending its contract with Gap after West, who now goes by Ye, said he was suing the retailer. Gap Inc. fell into the red in the second quarter due to macro headwinds, sales declines and persistent issues of its own. And in July, president and chief executive officer Sonia Syngal abruptly left the company.The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday first reported the corporate layoffs and calculated that they represented roughly 5 percent of the Gap’s 8,700 corporate employees. The maneuver will help the bottom line but more must be done to get the company back on track for the future and recapture the glow that Gap and Old Navy once had. However, Banana Republic has made strides by improving its fashion and seeing some recent lifts in sales.The breakup between Ye and Gap was hardly surprising considering for the two years after the deal was announced there was widespread skepticism that the collaboration would ever work out, and with Yeezy Gap gaining no traction. There has only been limited product drops on occasion so far, and Ye has accused the retailer of failing to fulfill certain contractual obligations, such as creating Yeezy Gap-branded stores. His lawyer Nicholas Gravante said in a statement last Thursday that Ye was left with “no choice but to terminate their collaboration.”Syngal has been replaced on an interim basis by Bob Martin, executive chairman of the board, until the company can find a permanent replacement. Additionally, Walmart Inc. executive Horacio “Haio” Barbeito became president and CEO of Old Navy, the value and family-oriented chain, and Gap’s biggest division, succeeding Nancy Green, who left in late April.]"

Shares slumping on news of the clothing retailer laying off 500 corporate employees to cut expenses. The layoffs are mainly at Gap's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, but you'll also see some in New York and in Asia. Said Gap's executive chairman and their interim CEO, as they're searching for a new one, Bob Martin in this internal memo, ""We've let our operating costs increase at a faster rate than our sales and, in turn, our profitability.""Sales have been slumping for years at the Gap, as well as Old Navy. They recently ended this partnership with Kanye West and the Yeezy Gap label after Kanye accused Gap of breaching their agreement. Gap posted a $49 million loss in the most recent quarter. Net sales fell 8%.Gap shares today fell another 3%, and they have been cut in half this year. They've had a load of problems, including the latest inventory issues, Rachelle. And it doesn't look like brighter days are right around the corner.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And they did say that partnership with Kanye had nothing to do with the layoffs, that it was a completely separate incident. But the timing-- the timing really couldn't be worse. If you're already in the spotlight with these accusations, and then, on top of that, adding layoffs-- and we know, obviously, it's not just happening with retail.We've seen these layoffs happening with tech as well. But it's sort of the bad timing when the consumer is already sort of figuring out what they want. You really want to stand out, and Gap is standing out but not in the best of ways, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it's been a very tough time for Gap, just looking back at what we've seen play out over the last year or two with the company, struggling, really, to turn around its business. Now in the face of very high inflation. Consumers pulling back spending heading in to the holiday season.We have heard from a number of retailers warn just about what that consumer spending could potentially look like at their stores over the coming months. So Gap coming out, making this announcements for the layoffs, I don't think it's a huge surprise to anyone who's been following this company very closely and, really, what we're seeing play out in the retail sector at large. But again, coming in the same week or so that we got the Kanye news, a very tough couple of days here for Gap.]"

(CSCO) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cisco-systems-130001224.html,1663765201,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned -10.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has lost 12.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.79 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $13.31 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.2%. The $54.07 billion and $56.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.9% and +3.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.2%. EPS of $0.83 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +1.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

709,e1054b1b-8eed-30e5-82c6-c74e04bfb0d1,CSCO,2022-09-22,"At US$42.58, Is It Time To Put Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-42-58-time-put-120055669.html,1663761655,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$49.37 and falling to the lows of US$41.96. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cisco Systems' current trading price of US$42.58 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What's The Opportunity In Cisco Systems?Great news for investors – Cisco Systems is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 14.81x is currently well-below the industry average of 23.72x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, Cisco Systems’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move closer to its industry peers, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Cisco Systems generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 17% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Cisco Systems. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed assessment.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.
