0,9ffe1b5a-6a56-33f5-b8ac-2f78af1ff4d7,SCHW,2022-12-04,Charles Schwab's (NYSE:SCHW) investors will be pleased with their notable 75% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwabs-nyse-schw-investors-120132876.html,1670155292,STORY,['SCHW'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which is up 68%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 27% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 6.3% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Charles Schwab was able to grow its EPS at 7.2% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 19% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Charles Schwab, it has a TSR of 75% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Charles Schwab shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 6.3% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 11% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors.

4,42bb14be-3118-38e3-9f60-c6c68242c07f,TMO,2022-12-04,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 89% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-120148642.html,1670155308,STORY,['TMO'],"[If you want to know who really controls Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 89% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Thermo Fisher Scientific. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Thermo Fisher Scientific, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Thermo Fisher Scientific is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$316m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Thermo Fisher Scientific. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Thermo Fisher Scientific , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsDividend stocks are a way to diversify a portfolio that may be chasing growth a little too obsessively. They generate income in good times, bad times and, particularly important today, times of high inflation. (U.S. consumer prices rose 6.4% in January from a year ago.)They also tend to outdo the S&amp;P 500 over the long run.One prominent portfolio that’s heavy on dividend stocks belongs to The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. With the trust being used to pay for so many initiatives, income needs to keep flowing into it.Dividend stocks help make this happen.Here are three dividend stocks that occupy significant space in the foundation’s holdings.Waste Management (WM)It’s not the most glamorous of industries, but waste management is an essential one.No matter what happens with the economy, municipalities have little choice but to pay companies to get rid of our mountains of garbage, even if those costs increase.As one of the biggest players in the space, Waste Management remains in an entrenched position.The shares have gone up 75% over the past five years. In 2022, operating revenue grew 9.9% year over year.Currently offering a yield of 1.9%, Waste Management’s dividend has increased 20 years in a row.The company has paid out $1.08 billion in dividends over the last year, and its roughly $2 billion in free cash flow for 2022 means investors shouldn’t have to worry about receiving their checks.Story continuesCaterpillar (CAT)As a company whose fortunes typically follow that of the larger economy — that’ll happen when your equipment is a fixture on building sites the world over — Caterpillar is in an intriguing post-pandemic position.The company’s revenues are feeling the effects of a paralyzed global supply chain, but President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill means there could be an awful lot of building going on in the U.S. in the near future.Read more: UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classCaterpillar’s mining and energy businesses also provide exposure to commodities, which tend to do well during times of high inflation.The company’s stock has ridden higher raw material and petroleum prices to a greater than 50% increase over the past five years.After announcing an 8% increase in June 2022, Caterpillar’s quarterly dividend is currently at $1.20 per share and offers a yield of 1.9%. The company has increased its annual dividend 28 years straight.Walmart (WMT)With grocery stores deemed essential businesses, Walmart was able to keep its more than 4,700 stores in the U.S. open throughout the pandemic.Not only has the company increased both profits and market share since COVID coughed its way across the planet, but its reputation as a low-cost haven makes Walmart many consumers’ go-to retailer when prices are rising.Walmart has steadily increased its dividends over the past 50 years. Its annual payout is currently $2.28 per share, translating into a dividend yield of 1.7%.Walmart currently trades at $137 per share, off its 52-week highs of $160.77 set in April 2022.A better way to generate income?Of course, buying dividend stocks isn't the only way to generate investment income.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, millionaire moguls are finding creative ways to effectively invest their millions.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.With a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart — and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

If you want to see more richest people in the world who own publicly traded companies, go directly to 5 Richest People in the World Who Own Publicly Traded Companies.Family owned businesses are businesses are where the the founder or the family of the founder owns a substantial share of the company and can influence important decisions, especially as it relates to the company's Chairman and CEO positions.In some ways, family owned businesses have their advantages. Because they have substantial influence, family owned businesses can often make important decisions faster than a non-family CEO given there is less resistance. Family owned businesses can also plan more for the long term rather than focusing on short term metrics if the owner chooses to do so.By definition, many tech startups are family owned given that their founders own a substantial share of the company and exercise a lot of influence. With the growth in the tech industry over the past few decades, some family owned companies have grown substantially and many of the founders rank among the world's richest people. Perhaps the best example of this would be billionaire Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) who founded the company before handing off control to current CEO Andy Jassy. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not make much profits for many years to gain more market share under Bezos.Some of the leading companies in emerging markets are also family owned. In India, billionaire Gautam Adani runs Adani Group while billionaire Mukesh Ambani continues to steer the giant company that is Reliance Industries.It should be said that being able to make decisions faster and focusing more on the long term can send stocks lower too. Because billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has the majority voting control of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), he has been able to invest tens of billions into the metaverse which the market has not liked in the near term and is one reason why the stock is lower.Story continuesIn terms of the world's richest people, 2022 has been a challenging year as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times so far.

If you want to see more stocks under $50 to buy, go directly to 5 Stocks Under $50 to Buy Now.According to the Labor Department on Friday, the U.S economy gained 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%. Furthermore, the average hourly pay rose 5.1% year over year in November, a welcome increase for workers who have to deal with inflation.In terms of inflation, October's core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 5% year over year versus September's rise of 5.2% year over year. The metric, which is favored by the Federal Reserve, was better than some expectations and indicated that inflation could potentially be peaking.Perhaps in part due to the good October core inflation data, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in late November, ""Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down. The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”With slower interest rate increases, potentially peaking inflation, and a still strong job market, the broader market has rallied recently with the S&amp;P 500 index up almost 14% from its October lows.While the data has been more positive of late, many wonder if inflation will stay high for longer than what the market is expecting or if interest rates will go higher than what the market is pricing in.Indeed, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers recently said that the thought interest rates might need to increase more than the market is judging.If interest rates stay high for too long or they rise too high, there's a chance that the economy might enter into a recession and many stocks might not do so well. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Stocks Under $50 to Buy Now, we picked 10 companies with earnings growth potential and we ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Stocks Under $50 to Buy Now10. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) is a regional bank whose shares have rallied from under $7.25 to $15.46 on December 3. Although shares of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) could have downside if there is a recession next year, the bank remains attractive long term given its normalized earnings power. Out of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 23 were long Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) at the end of Q3 2022.Alongside Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), and CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX), Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) is a stock under $50 that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) is a consumer beverage company that has seen shares more than triple since 2014. Oakmark Global Fund describes Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)'s long term business potential in a Q4 2020 investor letter,Keurig Dr Pepper is one of North America’s leading beverage companies and commands dominant positions in single-serve coffee and flavored sodas. We believe single-serve coffee pods will capture almost all of the incremental growth in at-home coffee consumption. Many consumers find that K-Cups offer better convenience, quality, variety and value, compared to drip brewing. Keurig’s competitive advantages (low-cost production, the largest installed base of brewers, exclusive brand partnerships) allow it to collect a toll on most pods sold in North America. The company’s soda franchises remain highly profitable, and we do not expect health-related concerns about sugar to materially impact consumption trends. We believe that Keurig’s brands should deliver steady growth, consistent market share gains and significant excess cash.Given Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)'s stock performance since 2021, Oakmark Global Fund's description as been accurate so far. There could be more growth in the future if Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) maintains its market share.8.

Oil prices have declined since October due to slower Chinese and global growth and higher interest rates.On Friday, G7 nations and Australia agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil in a move to deprive President Vladimir Putin of revenue while keeping Russian oil flowing to global markets.Moscow said it would not sell its oil under the cap and was analysing how to respond.Many analysts and OPEC ministers have said the price cap is confusing and probably inefficient as Moscow has been selling most of its oil to countries like China and India, which have refused to condemn the war in Ukraine.OPEC met virtually on Saturday without Russia and allies and did not discuss the Russian price cap, sources have said.""We will keep production as it is,"" one of the sources said on Sunday. OPEC+ begins talks at 1100 GMT with a meeting of the advisory Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) panel, followed by the full ministerial conference.

Crude prices soared over the past week with the same urgency with which they had plunged earlier in November as traders quickly worked out the math of mobility and energy demand returning to communities that had been suppressed for months.Yet, the rebound proved modest and fleeting. After a four-day run-up, the market turned down, closing Friday lower. New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, still finished with a 5% gain on the week and London’s Brent with a 2% rise. But oil bulls were disappointed as that contrasted with the 19% dive in the U.S. crude benchmark and the 16% tumble in the U.K. crude gauge.There were reasons, of course, for the dispirited performance.Some held back support for oil on Friday to see if OPEC+ would order deeper production cuts for January. The 23-nation alliance - which represents the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 other oil producers steered by Russia - had already announced in October a 2 million-barrels-per-day reduction that is to last through 2023. Where cuts are concerned, the more the merrier for oil bulls, and there was no certainty of that as yet on Friday.Also weighing on sentiment was news that European Union countries had agreed to a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian oil exports to punish Moscow over its war against Ukraine.Crude traders had initially feared that EU countries might go for a much smaller limit of $50 a barrel or below that could sufficiently anger President Vladimir Putin and prompt him to carry out his threat of slashing Russian oil production or exports to punish Europe instead over the move. But by moving up the cap, Europe may avert any Russian retaliation - keeping Moscow’s oil supplies to the region flowing and crude prices lower.Story continuesThe rebound in the dollar from 3-½ month lows was another bearish factor for oil and most other commodities priced in the currency.The greenback rose after data showed the United States added 263,000 jobs in November - the smallest since February 2021 but still more than 30% above market forecasts. The strong jobs number could make the Federal Reserve rethink its plan to impose smaller rate hikes hereon to curb inflation when the central bank holds its monthly policy meeting on Dec. 14.Then, there was just profit-taking by some oil traders. If the market didn’t give anything back, it could have ended the week up 10%. That’s a lot of money to leave on the table, especially when there’s no certainty of what OPEC+ would do.But more than all these were nagging concerns about how China’s oil demand would fare if Beijing reverts to aggressive COVID action later in December and over the coming year.“The Chinese government sold a narrative of how it successfully defeated COVID. Then, the narrative got away from it,” Jen Kirby wrote in a column that appeared in a Thursday edition of the Vox.“That narrative has been critical for President Xi. China’s triumphalism now looks like it had serious limitations - namely that China didn’t have a real exit plan from this strict containment strategy, especially as COVID-19 evolved and, with the Omicron variants, became even more transmissible.”The consensus among health experts and veteran China observers is that Beijing will likely loosen some of its strictest health policies and end up increasing COVID caseloads in the process. New infections from the virus hit a record high of 31,444 on Nov. 24. Some fear more dramatic spikes in a population that has a massive immunity gap for COVID compared with other nations.And the more the COVID duress on China, the more its contagion impact on oil, say analysts who predict the country could experience a demand slide of more than 1 million barrels per day versus the norm.“Chinese crude imports may go below 9 million barrels per day in January,"" Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, said in a Nov. 29 interview with Bloomberg Television.Chinese oil imports stood at a five-month high of 10.2 million barrels per day in October -- slightly above the pre-virus average -- after the government issued an additional fuel-export quota in an attempt to help revive the country’s economy.“Our view remains that zero-COVID will be in place through the winter,” Sen said, adding that Energy Aspects’ base case was for a China reopening from COVID in April.Jeff Currie, global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC recently that “demand is probably heading south again in China given what’s going on.”Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, also said energy traders have been mostly focused on China’s demand for oil.“The slowdown in demand from China will be temporary but having unsuccessfully fought COVID outbreaks with lockdowns for months, the prospect for an improvement looks months away and with the added risk of an economic slowdown reducing demand elsewhere, traders have increasingly been forced to change their short-term outlook,” Hansen said on Tuesday.Others said fears over China’s oil demand were overblown. “Oil markets may be misjudging news of China’s lockdown,” Rystad Energy said in an analysis. “The impact of the latest lockdowns as reflected in real-time traffic activity shows their likely effect on China’s short-term oil demand, particularly in transportation, is likely to be minor.”Real-time data on mainland Chinese road activity compiled by Rystad Energy points to a small downturn in country-level road traffic, down from 97% to 95% of 2019 levels during the fourth week of November. To compare, the strict large-scale lockdown in Shanghai in April 2022 resulted in country-level road traffic numbers plunging to around 90% of pre-COVID levels.“In essence, so far, the latest round of lockdowns appears to be mimicking previous ones, with nationwide road traffic only marginally affected while selected provinces undergoing comparatively severe lockdowns to try and suppress COVID-19 outbreaks,” Rystad Energy says, adding that the protests against the zero-COVID policy are an uncertainty going forward.Yes, it appears that Chinese President Xi’s decisions on COVID control and public freedom will have a greater say on the oil narrative for the year-end and beyond than the tweaks on OPEC+ production and exports by Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz.Oil: Market Settlements WTI for January delivery did a final trade of $80.34 after officially settling Friday’s session at $79.98 per barrel, down $1.24, or 1.5%. For the week though, the U.S. crude benchmark was up 4.9%.In the case of Brent crude, it did a final trade of $85.42 for the February delivery after officially settling at $85.57 per barrel, down $1.31, or 1.5% on the day. For the week though, the global crude benchmark was up 2.2%.Oil Price Technical Outlook: WTIIn follow through to the previous month's potentially bearish engulfing candle, WTI rebound from $73.60 finds it challenging to clear through and close above the weekly confluence of the 5-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $81.85 and the 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $81.65, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“The only thing giving hope to oil bulls will be the positive close for the week, as well as bullish crossover on the weekly time frame, that makes room for a renewed advance towards the 50-month EMA of 84.58 and the monthly middle Bollinger Band of $85.33,” said Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.He said strong acceptance above these resistance zones can add further momentum toward WTI’s next major supply zone of the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $87 followed by the 50-week EMA of $89.30.“Going into the new week, failure to clear through the $83 and $85 levels will keep the momentum subdued,” Dixit added. “Any consolidation below $81 will increase chances of a breakdown towards $77, followed by $75 and $73.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold retreated into familiar $1,700 territory on Friday after the release of another upbeat monthly U.S. jobs report, before futures of the yellow metal returned to their newly-established $1,800 perch ahead of the close on bets for a smaller Fed rate hike over the next two weeks.After 15 weeks of being trapped in the claws of $1,700 pricing or lower, both COMEX and spot gold broke free to hit a 5-month high above $1,800 an ounce on Thursday as easing U.S. inflation and jobs growth pointed to the likelihood of smaller Fed rate hikes from this month.The move was in sync with a preview issued by Investing.com before the November non-farm payrolls (NFP) report, which suggested gold’s action will be in compliance with two timelines: one reacting to Friday’s jobs data and the other more mindful of what the Fed could do the next fortnight.“Gold has had a nice rally since early November and profit taking could settle in, but a significant pullback doesn’t seem warranted,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “The economy is slowing down and inflation should steadily decline here and justify a pause in Fed rate hikes after the first quarter.”Gold futures’ benchmark February contract did a final trade of $1,811.40 an ounce after officially settling Friday at $1,809.60 on New York’s COMEX, down $5.60, or 0.3%.

This is a stunning increase at a CAGR of 12% and the industry is expected to continue growing at an even more exceptional CAGR of 12.9% and will cross $3.36 trillion by 2026.2022 has been a bumper year for the mining industry as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Since these two countries are major producers of several metals such as copper, iron and nickel while also being involved in other raw materials extraction such as of palladium, neon and platinum. When the war started, the supply of these metals was affected which led to an increase in prices. Prices also soared amid the West's sanctions on Russia. For example, palladium was being traded at $2,700 in February 2022, which showed an 80% increase in prices in a period of just two months.16 biggest mining companies in the worldartyom-korshunov-NWByxwVN-J0-unsplashAccording to KPMG, this is the first time in 12 years that commodities risk isn't the highest risk being faced by the mining industry.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$407.5mUS$644.3mUS$582.4mUS$826.5mUS$820.5mUS$821.5mUS$827.1mUS$836.0mUS$847.2mUS$860.2mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 0.12%Est @ 0.68%Est @ 1.07%Est @ 1.34%Est @ 1.53% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$375US$547US$456US$596US$545US$503US$466US$434US$406US$379(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.7bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$860m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.0%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$5.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$11b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$116, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ralph Lauren as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.277. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to read about some more artificial intelligence stocks, go directly to 5 Best AI Penny Stocks Under $1.Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving across the world to personalize experiences for individuals. In addition to their rudimentary applications, AI products are now evolving to include smarter chat-bots for customer service, personalizing services for individuals, and even placement of AI robots for self-service at banks. Beyond these basic applications, banks can also implement the technology for bringing in more efficiency to their screening and lending processes, and even for reducing security risks. Globally, artificial intelligence has been rapidly integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations. Small and medium businesses are also investing in the new technology to improve performance of their operations at a low cost. A significant development in 5G deployment, automation, cloud, and large databases, are likely to drive technology demand in the coming years. According to latest research, the global AI market size was $87 billion in 2021 and it is expected to hit US$ 1,597 billion by 2030 with a registered CAGR of 38%. What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Some of the common examples we hear today are chess-playing computers and self-driving cars. These processes rely on deep learning and natural language processing. According to the current system of classification, there are four primary AI types: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-awareness. Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of the world across nearly every industry. It is already driving emerging technologies like robotics, Internet of Things and big data. Artificial intelligence can take over many jobs but it is also responsible for creating many. Most of the businesses are considering the shift to AI-powered systems, apps, security systems, data analysis, and other applications. Story continuesThis technology is most commonly used to store and categorize data. Machine learning is also a major trend in the AI universe. Advanced software algorithms are designed to carry out one specific task, such as answering questions, translating languages or navigating a journey. Nation Language Generation is one of the mainstream trends of artificial intelligence. Supply chains are also enabled by artificial intelligence. Human computation is also a big trend in the present artificial intelligence industry. Pandemic, War Helped AI Market ExpandThe global AI market has benefited from two major global events that have led to slowdowns in other industries, namely the global pandemic of 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The former led to increased demand for AI products as more businesses shifted towards digital work models while the latter increased global government spending on AI software for defense, especially in European countries in close proximity to Russia. News publication Bloomberg has forecast a more than 35% annual growth rate for AI in the coming five years. It is estimated that North America led the global artificial intelligence market in the past few years, accounting for about 43 percent of overall revenue in 2021 alone. AI services in major sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, and automotive, in nations like China, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, has fueled AI expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover the expanding applications and simple deployment techniques have drawn governments and private organizations to AI technology as well. Some of the top firms working in the AI sector include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). However, investors must also be wary of certain complications related to the new technology. Firstly, AI is a complicated system, so the firms working in the space need employees with certain skill sets to create, manage, and deploy AI systems. These skills demand higher wages. Secondly, workers working with AI systems need varied understandings in deep learning and cognitive computing. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the artificial intelligence sector and were priced under $1 per share, as of December 3, were selected for the list.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the plight of the world and go directly to 5 Biggest Issues in the World and The Companies Working on Solving Them.The world is currently going through several crises, most of which are exacerbating each other. On November 15, 2022, the world population hit 8 billion people. All other things constant, it is expected to reach 10 billion people in 2050, according to UN forecasts. Growing population means more resource consumption. As economic growth around the world leads to rising living standards, consumption is expected to skyrocket. The UN International Resources Panel estimates that resource-use per person in 2050 will be 75% higher than it is today. Even in the present day, humanity is consuming resources 1.8 times faster than Earth’s biocapacity can regenerate, according to Overshoot Today. The ecological footprint of an average American is 8.1 Global Hectares (gha) per person, while Earth’s biocapacity is only 1.6 gha per person. If everyone consumed like the average American, we would need 5 Earths.A landmark MIT study done in 1972 accounted for interacting variables such as natural resources, population growth rate, food production/supply, industrial output, and pollution, in a system-dynamics computer model and showed that our default business-as-usual trajectory leads to overshoot and global system collapse somewhere in the mid-21st century. The data from 38 years since the study confirmed its findings in another study done in 2020. These are stark problems and have created demand for technological solutions, which is where the free market comes in to respond. Many established, as well as startup companies are attempting to solve these problems.For instance, climate change has resulted in the emergence of the carbon-capture industry (because we’re also destroying the natural carbon sinks, forests) made up of companies attempting to develop efficient and scalable carbon-capture technologies. Notable among these are Aker Carbon Capture ASA (OSLO:ACC.OL) and Carbfix. While some companies are actively trying to solve climate change, others like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing so passively, by adopting climate-friendly policies. Story continuesNow that we understand the background, let’s move on to the list of 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them.Photo by OCG Saving The Ocean on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them, we’ve consulted the UN’s Global-Issues list, and selected the ones that are the most globally consequential. For companies trying to solve them, we’ve used data from various forward-focused media organizations like The Verge, Tech Crunch, Gizmodo and Mashable.10. Gender EqualityGender disparity is still among the biggest issues in the world in 21st century, especially in the global south. Most of it results from the gender roles assigned to both biological sexes, where women get the worse end of the bargain.According to data from UNICEF, girls aged 10-14 are twice as likely to spend an average of 21 hours per week on household tasks than boys of the same age worldwide.The world is also missing out on the full potential of one-half of its population. The ILO report on gender gap in employment shows women represent only 47% of the workforce around the world while men make up 72% of it as of 2022. Many large market-cap companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are taking the initiative in gender inclusion and hiring more and more women for gender equity. An AI startup, called Pipeline, has also been one of the companies working on solving the issue. It has been making headlines for developing algorithms that help HR departments avoid hiring patterns which are systematically biased against intersectional female gender. 9. MisinformationMisinformation is one of the most pressing problems of the 21st century. It is having a corrosive effect on democracies and institutional trust, not only in the developing world but in the developed world as well, and leading to a rise in populism. Misinformation is also central to the present-day disdain for expertise. Its most recent example in the US was the response to the pandemic from some sections of the society. A significant number of people believed that pandemic lockdowns and vaccination were an excuse for “globalists” to take control of the society and microchip people for surveillance. A survey conducted by YouGov in collaboration with The Economist showed that one in five Americans held this belief. Misinformation spreads much faster through digital and social media platforms, which is why many digital technology companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), ByteDance and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have introduced various methods to detect and remove misinformation from their products’ platforms. 8. Wealth InequalityWealth inequality between countries, and between individuals within countries are among the biggest issues in the world. In terms of wealth inequality between individuals, the richest global 1% own 46% of the global wealth according to Inequality.org. For perspective, in 2018, it only took 26 billionaires to hold as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the entire world. High income inequality has been found to be linked with increased risk of economic instability and financial crises. Further, in developed nations, life expectancy and levels of physical health are often lower due to income inequality.Many startups have started to emerge that are working on solving the problem. One such startup is Pioneer. Its solution to wealth inequality is entrepreneurship. It hosts a sizable online competition every month where people present their projects like startups, books and research projects. These projects can be digitally voted for, by other members, adding points for advancement. Projects with highest points are evaluated at the end of the month and a dozen or so are selected for funding, backed by Marc Andreessen. 7. HealthGlobal health is in crisis, especially in the developing world, due to lack of proper medical resources, hygiene and socio-political issues. Apart from these two factors, many diseases have been wreaking havoc without a cure. Cancer, for instance, takes 1 out of 6 lives in the world every year, according to Webmd.com. In parts of the world like Africa, the threat of another viral outbreak is ever present. The two recent outbreaks, of Ebola Virus and Zika Virus, occurred in 2013 and 2015, respectively, contributing to a 63% increase in zoonotic diseases on the continent from 2012-2022, according to WHO.The Covid-19 outbreak, which has claimed nearly 7 million lives as of 2022, also showed the world how unprepared it is to deal with outbreaks of airborne viruses, despite their statistical inevitability. Many companies are working to tackle the rising threat of global health crises. These include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is known for developing Ervebo, the vaccine for Ebola Virus that contained its spread. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is known for its contribution to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first vaccine to roll out for Covid-19. 6. PovertyExtreme poverty is one of the biggest humanitarian issues in the world. According to World Vision, around 9.2% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, and make less than $1.90 a day. A number of startup companies have emerged as of late to alleviate suffering caused by poverty. One such startup is Unhoused.org. It is a London-based retailer that sells items like clothes, dental kits, and other consumer products. For every product it sells, it donates the same to an organization helping the homeless community. Another startup, known as Wagestream, lets the workers of companies which are subscribed to it, tap into their incomes at any time of the month so they can accommodate their ongoing needs. The company has received significant investment from people like Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also significantly contributed to tackling extreme poverty. Google has contributed $50 million to the global education project and $50 million to the economic opportunity initiative in the battle against extreme poverty.

Companies and organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to large corporations, are investing heavily in cybersecurity solutions to protect their data and networks. The cybersecurity industry is a vital part of the modern economy, and its growth is expected to continue in the coming years.

(NASDAQ:QLYS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions. Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a trusted security and compliance partner for some of the world’s largest enterprises, including Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and national healthcare institutions among others. The company is profitable and cash-rich and is one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy heading into 2023. According to the company's balance sheet, Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) has free cash flows of $177.8 million, a trailing twelve-month operating margin of 27.51%, and an ROE of 26.77%.On November 3, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives updated his price target on Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) to $140 from $150 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares.At the close of Q3 2022, 25 hedge funds were long Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) and disclosed stakes worth $295.5 million. Of those, Fundsmith LLP was the most prominent investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $92.19 million.Here is what Headwaters Capital had to say about Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise, end-points, cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses, it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently, QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021.The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection, the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity, which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically, cybersecurity was best served by firewalls, which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter, the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM, VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways, vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities.Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM, industry tailwinds and a market leading product, QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive, QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&amp;D or its sales force. R&amp;D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&amp;M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently, QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)Big tech companies that are heavily investing in cybersecurity include Meta Platforms, Inc.

The U.S. Army is CACI’s single largest customer. This position replaces BWXT in Upslope’s “defense basket” (articulated in Q1 on p. 4). CACI’s business is mostly split across Expertise (providing talent to government agencies – e.g. software engineers) and Technology (design and delivery of specific technology-oriented services and products, including for example, battlefield hardware). The company offers its services and products in support of both day-to-day agency operations and specific missions.At a high-level, CACI reminds me of another Upslope long in an unrelated sector: Silgan Holdings (packaging/dispensing and food can business). Both are truly sleepy value stocks that trade for low doubledigit earnings multiples, but have a strong history of steady value creation and free cash flow per share growth. Both the stocks and underlying businesses appear very well-positioned for the uncertain macro (or geopolitical, in CACI’s case) environment we’re likely to face in the years ahead. Other notable thesis points for CACI specifically:Long-term Geopolitical &amp; Other Tailwinds – like other components of Upslope’s defense basket, CACI should benefit from an attractive defense spending environment for years to come. CACI should also benefit from IT modernization efforts in U.S. government agencies, as well as its strength in cyber/electronic warfare offerings…” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.62bUS$3.97bUS$4.90bUS$6.27bUS$6.68bUS$6.98bUS$7.25bUS$7.49bUS$7.70bUS$7.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.6%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.6kUS$4.5kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$144bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$144b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$69bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$110b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$105, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Starbucks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.093. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Cramer's market predictions, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim Cramer. The investing landscape has widely transformed this year as recession fears pull investors toward previously overlooked defensive securities. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC, advises investors to invest in profitable companies that have strong shareholder returns. In addition to this, he also talked about loading up on high-yielding dividend stocks in one of his shows recorded in late September.In one of his recent shows in October, Cramer mentioned that tech stocks have fallen this year because of the tightening monetary policy. However, the decline in tech stocks opens new investment avenues for investors where they can take refuge in other sectors. According to Cramer, some of the industries that investors should focus on include fossil fuels, healthcare, travel, defense, and food and beverage.According to Cramer, the continuous interest rate hikes this year indicate that the trend will likely continue for the rest of the year. This eventually increases the risks of a possible recession. He further mentioned that though the rapidly rising treasury yields have put pressure on dividend stocks, they still offer better investment opportunities than the rest of the market. He mentioned that investors should steadily build their position in dividends to gain maximum profits.Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors this year as many companies reinstated and raised their payouts after the pandemic of 2020. According to the third quarter report of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set record payments in Q3 and saw an 8.5% growth from the same period last year. The report also highlighted that dividends are expected to reach their record by the next quarter. Some of the most popular dividend stocks include Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as they have raised their dividends for a long time.Story continuesIn view of the above-stated arguments and to further expand upon Cramer’s investment strategy, we will discuss the best dividend stocks according to Jim Cramer.Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim CramerOur Methodology:We selected dividend stocks from some of Jim Cramer's recent programs in which he recommended these securities.

Whether you’re streaming “Wednesday” on Netflix (NFLX) or playing “Call of Duty,” a brand-new big screen is always a welcome addition to any living room.But TV manufacturers don’t exactly make buying one easy. From confusing marketing lingo, to unnecessary features (I’m looking at you 8K resolution) picking up a set can be an overwhelming endeavor.Luckily, for you, I’m here to help you figure out what to look for in your next television to ensure you get the best setup for your home.Sizing up your TVIf you’re anything like me, you want a TV so large it could blot out the Sun. But a TV that big probably won’t fit in my Queens apartment. My point is while you might want a giant TV, you need to make sure it’s the right size for your space.If you get a set that’s too large, you’ll have a hard time seeing the entire picture. Get one that’s too small, though, and the image will be difficult to make out. There are a slew of math formulas you can use to help you figure out the right size set for your room.Sony (SONY), for example, says a 4K panel’s size should measure two-thirds the distance between where you’ll be seated and where you’ll set up your TV. So if you’re sitting 5 feet, or 60 inches, from your TV, you should get a 40-inch TV.A shopper passes by a display of big-screen televisions in a Costco warehouse Friday, Oct. 14, 2022, in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)Samsung, meanwhile, recommends you get a 4K TV that’s roughly half the size of the distance from your couch to your TV in inches. So if you’re going to be sitting 10 feet from your TV, or 120 inches, you’ll want to get a 60-inch TV.If you’re opting for a 1080p TV rather than a 4K model, you might want to sit a bit further away from your set. That’s because 4K TVs have more pixels (the tiny dots that make up the picture), which allows you to sit closer to your TV without losing detail.If all of that sounds a little much, you can opt for a decidedly more physical approach and simply cut out a large piece of cardboard the size of the TV you want and place it in your room to see if it’s a good size for your space.Story continues1080p versus 4K versus 8KScreen resolution measures the number of pixels your TV has. Generally, the more pixels, the sharper the image. But screen size is also an important item to consider when it comes to the resolution of the TV you’re getting. Chances are if you’re shopping for a new set, it will have a resolution with roughly 4,000 pixels across, or 4K. TV manufacturers love to slap flashy numbers on their boxes to get you to think their product is the best on the shelf, but that’s not necessarily the truth.As a rule of thumb, a 1080p resolution is fine on a TV that’s 50 inches or smaller. If you’re getting a 1080p, 42-inch TV will look plenty sharp. That’s because the screen is small enough to pack all of those pixels tightly together. Getting a 55-inch or larger TV? Opt for 4K for better image quality.If you're looking for a TV that's 55 inches or larger, go for 4K. (Image: REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke)What about those 8K TVs though? Surely they’ve got to be even sharper, right? I mean, 8K is a higher resolution than 4K, right? Here’s where screen size limits come in. You’ve got to get a pretty large TV or be seated incredibly close for an 8K TV to look noticeably sharper than a 4K set. Oh, and 8K content is still hard to come by. So don’t expect to be able to stream it via Netflix anytime soon.Basically, if you’re choosing between a 4K TV or an 8K TV, this is the time when you’re going to want to opt for the lower number. You’ll save some cash, 4K is usually less expensive than 8K, and images will look just as sharp. If money isn’t an issue, though, and you’re going to be seated exceptionally close to your TV, then sure, go for the 8K set. But don’t make it a priority over 4K.LCD, OLED, mini LED, QLED, or MicroLEDModern TVs use two kinds of screen technology: LED and OLED. LED sets are the most common on the market and cost less than OLED models. The basic difference between the two models is that LED TVs passively light up the screen’s pixels by passing light through filters. OLED panels, meanwhile, light up individual pixels on their own.LED panels are less expensive than OLED models, and come in a variety of configurations. Some sets use edge lighting, which means that strips of LEDs run along the left and right sides or top and bottom of the TV.Edge lighting, though, can create areas where light bleeds into scenes where it shouldn’t otherwise be. I had an edge-lit LG TV, and while watching movies night scenes looked washed out, as light would seep into dark portions of a scene. That’s because the light isn’t directly behind the area that’s supposed to be lit up; it’s being directed there from the LEDs on the edge of the panel.MicroLED TVs are still relatively new, and incredibly expensive. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Other types of LED TVs use a full-array backlight, which helps with this issue by putting the LEDs behind the screen rather than around the edges, but those LEDs never quite shut off completely to create true black. That’s where OLED TVs come in.OLED TVs can turn off individual pixels when they need to be black, helping bright areas of a scene stand out more, and making for better overall images. I’ve got an LG C1 OLED TV and I absolutely love it. That said, OLED TVs can sometimes struggle in especially bright places. So keep that in mind if your TV is going to be set up in direct sunlight or outside. If you’re putting it up in your living room with a window nearby, though, it’ll look perfect.Companies like Samsung also offer what’s called QLED TVs, which add a layer of quantum dots that allow for improved color and contrast versus standard LED TVs. but they’re still not going to beat out the capabilities of an OLED TV.Then there are mini-LED TVs. These are TVs that, you guessed it, use smaller LEDs for their backlights. As a result, manufacturers can pack in more mini-LEDs into a TV than they would with regular LEDs, making for better color and cutting down on light bleed. They do this using a technique called local dimming, which means that the LEDs that produce light in a darker section of an image are dimmed, giving your content a better overall contrast.If you’ve got more money than you know what to do with, there’s one final category of TVs called MicroLED TVs. These use millions of individual LEDs to power each on-screen pixel, allowing for perfect blacks and bright whites. It's the best of both LED and OLED, but it's also incredibly expensive. We’re talking nearly $100,000.The best option? Go with an OLED TV. If you’re looking to save, then check out a mini-LED TV or QLED with a full-array backlight. Opt for a standard edge-lit LED if you’re on a budget.Refresh rateThis last major spec to watch for is your TV’s refresh rate, or the number of times a screen updates with new information per second, listed as hertz (Hz). Most TVs have refresh rates of about 60Hz. High-end TVs, though, can have rates of up to 120Hz.The higher the refresh rate, the smoother image. Think of it like a flip book cartoon. The slower you flip from page to page, the jankier the cartoon looks. Flip the pages faster and the cartoon will look nice and smooth.Frame rate is especially important if you’re going to be gaming on your new TV. Since you’re constantly moving around in games, a higher frame rate usually means a better image experience. That said, 120Hz frame rates are usually only available on mid-range to high-end TVs. If you want the best image, go for 120Hz. If you don’t need it, and are fine with the way a 60Hz model looks, grab that instead.Manufacturers, however, use different marketing terms to express, and exaggerate, their TVs’ refresh rates. Your best bet is to do your own research and check a manufacturer’s site for the TV’s true refresh rate.PortsFinally, if you’re shopping for a new TV, you’ll want it to have plenty of ports. We’re talking HDMI, USB, optical audio, the works. Most mid- to high-end TVs have a USB port and four HDMI ports as well as optical audio for sound bars or other audio systems. Entry-level TVs usually have two HDMI ports and lack USB slots.There are also different versions of HDMI. If you're a gamer, you'll want a TV with HDMI 2.1, which allows your set to display 4K content at 120Hz. You'll also need an HDMI cable that supports the standard, but you can pick those up on the cheap, around $10 to $20, via Amazon.If your new TV is going to be the center of your entertainment setup, be sure to get one with four HDMI ports. This way you’ll have plenty of space to connect your game systems, streaming boxes, and anything else you might want to plug into your set.Above all, happy watching!Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanMusk is biting the hand that feeds TwitterApple stock slides ahead of holidays amid protests in China and supply chain crunchHottest video games of 2022Got a tip?

Sure, some indicators suggest that the central bank might loosen its stance. However, in the bigger picture, folks must deal with reality. Following an unprecedented expansion of the money supply, the Fed must control act aggressively.Don’t take my word for it. Instead, just listen to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who insists on a higher target policy rate. “We’ve got a ways to go to get restrictive,” he said in an interview with MarketWatch. That’s not great news for growth-oriented names. But it could spell good tidings (at least relatively speaking) for stocks to buy for rising interest rates.AFLAflac$72.09PGRProgressive$132.17SRESempra Energy$165.06PSXPhillips 66$109.09ABAllianceBernstein$40.30DFSDiscover Financial$107.66ARCCAres Capital$19.60InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAflac (AFL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn insurance specialist, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) represents the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the U.S. While the company underwrites a range of policy requests, it’s perhaps best known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage. This service pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness, per the company’s public profile.Fundamentally, AFL makes a strong case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates because of fears of unknown variables. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of a worldwide outbreak leading to mass pandemonium was either exclusive to history books or Hollywood dramas. Given that it became a harsh reality, people now take supplemental insurance coverage much more seriously.To be fair, Gurufocus.com labels AFL as significantly overvalued. On a year-to-date basis, AFL jumped nearly 22%. Also, in the trailing month, it’s up almost 9%. Nevertheless, AFL still trades at 9-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings, which sits below the sector median of 12 times. Combined with its fundamental relevance, AFL ranks as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Story continuesProgressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWell known for its quirky commercials featuring the fictional salesperson character Flo, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) represents the third largest insurance carrier and the number one commercial auto insurer in the U.S. Fundamentally, insurance stocks and benchmark rates generally feature a direct correlation: as one rises, so too does the other.Now, certain circumstances such as market volatility and other critical headwinds may disrupt this relationship. Nevertheless, as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates, PGR makes an excellent case for itself because of the underlying business. Simply put, according to Progressive’s website, nearly every state requires car insurance coverage. The lone state that doesn’t – Massachusetts – still requires proof of financial responsibility.In other words, Progressive cynically enjoys a captive audience. Further, with the post-pandemic new normal imposing ramped up dangers on the road, insurance becomes even more critical. Therefore, PGR easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Sempra Energy (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Most folks I talk to love the Golden State, particularly Southern California. With excellent weather year-round and plenty of stuff to do, it’s a dream experience for many. However, great experiences come at a cost. While many residents complain about the metaphorical sunshine tax, it’s actually a real thing. Enter Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE).Representing one of the largest utility holding companies in the U.S., Sempra commands a massive footprint of about 40 million customers. Further, these households tend to generate higher-than-average income compared to the rest of the nation. As well, because California represents a highly desired destination state – conservative talking points be damned – Sempra knows it owns a hostage audience.Because of this permanent demand structure, SRE cynically ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. While I get that people are moving out of California in droves, there are also plenty of higher-income folks moving in. Thus, SRE will continue to enjoy tremendous relevance.Phillips 66 (PSX)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comWith Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), investors will want to exercise caution through careful entry into the market. A multinational energy firm, Phillips 66 mainly specializes in the downstream component of the industry. This deals with segments such as refining and marketing. However, rising borrowing costs tend to be negative for commodities, including energy resources. Therefore, you may want to tiptoe into PSX shares.Indeed, the circumstances become more complicated because of the underlying market performance. Since the start of the year, PSX gained nearly 44% of equity value. Also, in the trialing month, it’s up 4.5%. In other words, interested investors may want to wait a bit until shares cool down before pulling the trigger.Nevertheless, the broader fundamentals should bode well for PSX, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. With possibly 90% of companies requiring a return to the office (at least partially), this circumstance will boost mobility statistics. Of course, mobility on the freeways isn’t free, thus benefitting PSX.AllianceBernstein (AB)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comIn prior InvestorPlace articles, I’ve mentioned the bullish case for AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), typically because outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rates AB shares highly. However, as a candidate among stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m sure many folks remain skeptical. After all, AllianceBernstein represents a global asset management firm. Its job becomes much more difficult during a deflationary cycle.And believe me, should the Fed continue to shrink the money supply via raising borrowing costs, this action is deflationary: fewer dollars chasing after more goods. Under this scenario, several publicly traded securities may stumble because of business erosion.Still, AB could be a surprise idea among stocks to buy for rising interest rates because of societal realities. AllianceBernstein caters to high-net-worth individuals, meaning that the enterprise uses only the best resources. It also only hires the best advisors. Combine the two and you have one of the few asset managers that can guide their clients successfully through this deflationary storm. Just imagine the powerful word of mouth that such a success story can generate.Discover Financial (DFS)Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a ""BUY NOW!"" button on a laptop keyboard.Source: ShutterstockAlthough Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) tends to be overlooked relative to its more popular competitors within the financial services space, DFS is well worth consideration among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. On an elemental and cynical level, Discover pads its bottom line when interest rates rise. Further, as economic pressures build, people tend to resort to credit to make ends meet.Again, it’s a cynical argument and I’m not celebrating this dynamic. Rather, I’m pointing out the harsh truth. For instance, after the level of consumer loans dropped to a multi-year low of $739 billion in April 2021, this metric skyrocketed to $928 billion this month. Interestingly, consumer loans hit over $859 billion just before the coronavirus pandemic capsized American society.Personally, it appears that rising consumer debt amid significant economic ambiguities represents a danger point. Still, for the near and intermediate term, it’s quite possible that DFS qualifies as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Bluntly speaking, DFS will benefit until it doesn’t.Ares Capital (ARCC)BUY spelled out on a computer keyboard representing stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOn a final note, if you want to take a pot shot regarding stocks to buy for rising interest rates, you could check out Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC). Billed as a leading business development company (BDC) with a focus on comprehensive financing solutions for middle-market enterprises, Ares might seem a risky venture under the current environment. After all, companies tend to fail during deflationary cycles.Nevertheless, Wall Street remains relatively warm to ARCC stock. No, it’s not in positive territory. However, with an 8% loss for the year – compared to more than 17% down for the S&amp;P 500 – Ares currently holds its own. As well, ARCC appears to have arrested its decline, fading just barely under parity in the trailing half-year period.Fundamentally, Ares rescue-financing business – which targets enterprises featuring a market capitalization of between $20 and $200 million – could be enticing. Because these companies don’t have the same access to capital markets as an established blue chip, Ares can forge a robust niche.It’s risky but sometimes, you need to take some wagers to enjoy big gains in this type of market.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

It is a primary cause of type 2 diabetes and been linked to heart disease, certain cancers and other health complications such as more severe COVID-19.The weight loss field has gained renewed medical and investor attention in recent months after diabetes drugs from Eli Lilly and Co and Novo Nordisk, known as semaglutide and tirzepatide, were proven to help obese patients lose weight.Both of those drugs, which need to be injected every two weeks, are designed to activate GLP-1, a hormone that triggers the feeling of fullness in the body after eating.Amgen's AMG133 also targets GLP-1, but has a dual mechanism which aims at the same time to block activity of a gene known as GIP.The drug was developed from work at Amgen to identify genetic signals associated with lower fat mass and body weight, and also healthy metabolic profiles, explained Saptarsi Haldar, head of cardiovascular metabolic discovery at Amgen.Story continues""Genetics clearly showed in multiple large populations that decreased activity genetically of the GIP receptor gene was associated with lower BMI (body mass index),"" he said.The California-based biotech said it plans to launch a larger mid-stage study of AMG133 early next year, which will enroll a broader range of patients, including those with additional health conditions such as diabetes.JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott earlier this month said that if all goes well, a Phase III study of AMG133 could begin in 2024, with a launch expected in 2026 or 2027, if approved.

This is a stunning increase at a CAGR of 12% and the industry is expected to continue growing at an even more exceptional CAGR of 12.9% and will cross $3.36 trillion by 2026.2022 has been a bumper year for the mining industry as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Since these two countries are major producers of several metals such as copper, iron and nickel while also being involved in other raw materials extraction such as of palladium, neon and platinum. When the war started, the supply of these metals was affected which led to an increase in prices. Prices also soared amid the West's sanctions on Russia. For example, palladium was being traded at $2,700 in February 2022, which showed an 80% increase in prices in a period of just two months.16 biggest mining companies in the worldartyom-korshunov-NWByxwVN-J0-unsplashAccording to KPMG, this is the first time in 12 years that commodities risk isn't the highest risk being faced by the mining industry.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Newmont's shares before the 7th of December to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.55 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.20 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Newmont has a trailing yield of 4.5% on the current share price of $48.67. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Newmont's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Newmont Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Newmont paid out 180% of profit in the past year, which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Newmont paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 110%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.Story continuesAs Newmont's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Newmont's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly, but the company is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of its earnings as dividends. Fast-growing businesses normally need to reinvest most of their earnings in order to maintain growth, so we'd suspect that either earnings growth will slow or the dividend may not be increased for a while.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Newmont has delivered 4.6% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Newmont is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.Final TakeawayHas Newmont got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? While it's nice to see earnings per share growing, we're curious about how Newmont intends to continue growing, or maintain the dividend in a downturn given that it's paying out such a high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.So if you're still interested in Newmont despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Newmont (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

48,88f11f14-f2a7-3d8a-8813-740cc8900b1a,GD,2022-12-04,General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) Shares Could Be 35% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-corporation-nyse-gd-140031259.html,1670076031,STORY,['GD'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.98bUS$4.33bUS$4.48bUS$4.98bUS$5.26bUS$5.50bUS$5.71bUS$5.89bUS$6.06bUS$6.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x5Analyst x3Est @ 5.6%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.75%Est @ 3.22%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$137bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$137b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$72bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$108b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$256, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.905. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

If you want to read about some more artificial intelligence stocks, go directly to 5 Best AI Penny Stocks Under $1.Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving across the world to personalize experiences for individuals. In addition to their rudimentary applications, AI products are now evolving to include smarter chat-bots for customer service, personalizing services for individuals, and even placement of AI robots for self-service at banks. Beyond these basic applications, banks can also implement the technology for bringing in more efficiency to their screening and lending processes, and even for reducing security risks. Globally, artificial intelligence has been rapidly integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations. Small and medium businesses are also investing in the new technology to improve performance of their operations at a low cost. A significant development in 5G deployment, automation, cloud, and large databases, are likely to drive technology demand in the coming years. According to latest research, the global AI market size was $87 billion in 2021 and it is expected to hit US$ 1,597 billion by 2030 with a registered CAGR of 38%. What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Some of the common examples we hear today are chess-playing computers and self-driving cars. These processes rely on deep learning and natural language processing. According to the current system of classification, there are four primary AI types: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-awareness. Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of the world across nearly every industry. It is already driving emerging technologies like robotics, Internet of Things and big data. Artificial intelligence can take over many jobs but it is also responsible for creating many. Most of the businesses are considering the shift to AI-powered systems, apps, security systems, data analysis, and other applications. Story continuesThis technology is most commonly used to store and categorize data. Machine learning is also a major trend in the AI universe. Advanced software algorithms are designed to carry out one specific task, such as answering questions, translating languages or navigating a journey. Nation Language Generation is one of the mainstream trends of artificial intelligence. Supply chains are also enabled by artificial intelligence. Human computation is also a big trend in the present artificial intelligence industry. Pandemic, War Helped AI Market ExpandThe global AI market has benefited from two major global events that have led to slowdowns in other industries, namely the global pandemic of 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The former led to increased demand for AI products as more businesses shifted towards digital work models while the latter increased global government spending on AI software for defense, especially in European countries in close proximity to Russia. News publication Bloomberg has forecast a more than 35% annual growth rate for AI in the coming five years. It is estimated that North America led the global artificial intelligence market in the past few years, accounting for about 43 percent of overall revenue in 2021 alone. AI services in major sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, and automotive, in nations like China, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, has fueled AI expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover the expanding applications and simple deployment techniques have drawn governments and private organizations to AI technology as well. Some of the top firms working in the AI sector include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). However, investors must also be wary of certain complications related to the new technology. Firstly, AI is a complicated system, so the firms working in the space need employees with certain skill sets to create, manage, and deploy AI systems. These skills demand higher wages. Secondly, workers working with AI systems need varied understandings in deep learning and cognitive computing. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the artificial intelligence sector and were priced under $1 per share, as of December 3, were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices.

For example, palladium was being traded at $2,700 in February 2022, which showed an 80% increase in prices in a period of just two months.16 biggest mining companies in the worldartyom-korshunov-NWByxwVN-J0-unsplashAccording to KPMG, this is the first time in 12 years that commodities risk isn't the highest risk being faced by the mining industry.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Cramer's market predictions, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim Cramer. The investing landscape has widely transformed this year as recession fears pull investors toward previously overlooked defensive securities. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC, advises investors to invest in profitable companies that have strong shareholder returns. In addition to this, he also talked about loading up on high-yielding dividend stocks in one of his shows recorded in late September.In one of his recent shows in October, Cramer mentioned that tech stocks have fallen this year because of the tightening monetary policy. However, the decline in tech stocks opens new investment avenues for investors where they can take refuge in other sectors. According to Cramer, some of the industries that investors should focus on include fossil fuels, healthcare, travel, defense, and food and beverage.According to Cramer, the continuous interest rate hikes this year indicate that the trend will likely continue for the rest of the year. This eventually increases the risks of a possible recession. He further mentioned that though the rapidly rising treasury yields have put pressure on dividend stocks, they still offer better investment opportunities than the rest of the market. He mentioned that investors should steadily build their position in dividends to gain maximum profits.Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors this year as many companies reinstated and raised their payouts after the pandemic of 2020. According to the third quarter report of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set record payments in Q3 and saw an 8.5% growth from the same period last year. The report also highlighted that dividends are expected to reach their record by the next quarter. Some of the most popular dividend stocks include Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as they have raised their dividends for a long time.Story continuesIn view of the above-stated arguments and to further expand upon Cramer’s investment strategy, we will discuss the best dividend stocks according to Jim Cramer.Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim CramerOur Methodology:We selected dividend stocks from some of Jim Cramer's recent programs in which he recommended these securities.

53,0df2cdc9-b97a-330a-a323-bf8707b63cec,MDT,2022-12-04,7 Excellent Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Holiday Season,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-excellent-dividend-stocks-buy-204937339.html,1669841377,STORY,"['HD', 'MDT', 'KR', 'VZ', 'DVN', 'HPQ']","[With the holiday season upon us, investors may want to focus largely on dividend stocks to buy. While growth-oriented names provide the most excitement, market participants must acknowledge reality. As prior monetary policy dramatically expanded the money supply, the Federal Reserve must act aggressively to control inflation. That’s bad for growth but a relative positive for established passive-income-offering companies.Generally speaking, the enterprises undergirding dividend stocks to buy feature established businesses with strong profitability track records. After all, those dividends must come from somewhere. Further, as some officials suggest that the benchmark interest rate might rise, growth names might become red-shirted in 2023. With limited viable options available, astute investors will likely target these dividend stocks to buy this winter.KRKroger$49.34HDHome Depot$322.31MCDMcDonald’s$272.48MDTMedtronic$78.48HPQHP.$29.99VZVerizon$38.94DVNDevon Energy$68.64Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comNothing brings out the holiday festivities like good food to share among friends and family. Naturally, then, Kroger (NYSE:KR) offers an excellent narrative for dividend stocks to buy this winter. Aside from the holiday angle, Kroger’s grocery store business also plays into the trade-down effect or the meeting of needs through cheaper alternatives. Stated differently, economic pressures may force those eating at expensive restaurants to cook for themselves, thus bolstering KR.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegarding its passive income, Dividend.com notes that Kroger features a forward yield of 2.11%. While not the most generous, it does exceed the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio – or the proportion of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to net income – is only 24.9%. This implies long-term stability and dependability.Story continuesTo be fair, Gurufocus.com labels KR as modestly overvalued. However, the market prices KR at 12-times forward earnings, whereas the sector median is 16.4 times. From this angle, then, Kroger brings an attractive proposition as one of the dividend stocks to buy.Home Depot (HD)an interior view of a house attic under constructionSource: ronstik / Shutterstock.comOne of the underappreciated holiday plays, shoppers can go to Home Depot (NYSE:HD) for their Christmas trees and similar accoutrements. In addition, the brown stuff hitting the proverbial fan doesn’t abide by artificial human standards. When a pipe breaks, it will break when the laws of physics dictate. Therefore, winter season or not, Home Depot enjoys everyday relevance.Specifically as one of the dividend stocks to buy, the home improvement retailer features a forward yield of 2.41%. Again, it’s not the most generous yield, though it does beat the sector’s average of 1.89%. Furthermore, Home Depot has increased its dividend 142 times. Therefore, while the payout ratio is on the “warm” side of things at 44.8%, it offers reliable passive income.Even better, according to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculation of fair market value (FMV), HD rates as modestly undervalued. Against traditional financial metrics, Home Depot’s return on asset is 22.8%, beating out over 97% of the competition. This also reflects a very high-quality business.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockNo matter what your belief systems, the winter season centers on the importance of family. In that respect, the coronavirus pandemic and the catapulting of work-from-home initiatives essentially created a two-year holiday season. However, with perhaps most companies scheduled to bring back workers to the office in 2023, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) might be an underappreciated beneficiary.As a CNBC report pointed out, people returning to the office provided strong demand for breakfast products even as they cut back on other expenditures. Now, this report came out in late August of this year. Imagine, then, that say 90% of workers were forced to return to the office at least part of the time. Not only that, these folks wouldn’t have much of a choice if they want to save their jobs in a recession.Fundamentally, this dynamic augurs well for MCD as one of the dividend stocks to buy. Currently, it features a forward yield of 2.24%. In addition, the Golden Arches enjoys 45 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will want to keep.Medtronic (MDT)Doctor or physician calculating a patients medical bills at a desk. Medical bills, health costs, health expenses.Source: THICHA SATAPITANON / ShutterstockA medical device company, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) may provide a feel-good narrative for the holiday season. Among its many products, Medtronic features solutions for diabetes patients, enabling these folks to effectively manage their condition. Again, with the winter months putting a focus on family, MDT offers something to think about.To be fair, though, prospective participants must own a contrarian spirit. Several days ago, Medtronic delivered disappointing results for its fiscal second-quarter sales, citing slower procedure and supply recovery. As a result, management lowered its earnings forecast for the year. Still, at some point, its core markets will likely recover. When they do, MDT may offer substantial upside.For now, the company ranks among the dividend stocks to buy this winter. Per Dividend.com, Medtronic features a forward yield of 3.56%. This rates conspicuously higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. While the payout ratio is on the higher side at 51.4%, MDT also commands 45 years of consecutive dividend increases.HP (HPQ)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockWhen you’re dealing with consumer electronics, particularly hardware providers like HP (NYSE:HPQ), its upside narrative presents risks. Unfortunately, consumer sentiment ranks poorly at the moment, imposing potential headwinds on HPQ. Nevertheless, the underlying company represents one of the dividend stocks to buy for its potential to positively surprise onlookers.Recently, statements by Federal Reserve officials suggest that the central bank might sustain aggressive interest rate hikes. If so, the previously rising labor market may come under fire. And that may force employees to encounter an ultimatum: return to the office or quit. Some folks will choose the latter, which then boosts the gig economy. In turn, the rise of white-collar independent contractors may catalyze demand for HP’s computer products.Admittedly, it’s a narrative that requires multiple stars to align but it’s within the realm of possibility. Further, the company provides a forward yield of 3.64%. This ranks well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, HP’s payout ratio is 31.5%, which is very healthy. Thus, it’s one of the dividend stocks to buy this winter.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockAs a telecommunications specialist, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) enjoys an obvious play as a holiday-related enterprise. Again, the season centers on connecting with loved ones, fitting right into Verizon’s core business offering. To be fair, though, VZ stock has seen better days. Since the start of the year, shares fell nearly 27%. If that wasn’t enough of a warning, Gurufocus.com warns that Verizon represents a possible value trap. For instance,  while the market prices VZ at only 7.6-times forward earnings, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 0.5%. That’s rather pedestrian, making the prospect of the company hitting its income-statement-related performance targets rather suspect.Still, if you’re looking for dividend stocks to buy, Verizon may appeal to speculators. According to Dividend.com, the company carries a forward yield of 6.8%. This ranks much higher than the communication sector’s average yield of 2.62%. Also, the enterprise commands 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management won’t give up without a fight.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOne of the hottest performers among dividend stocks to buy, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) benefitted from a relevancy surge. Specializing in hydrocarbon exploration, Devon represents one of the leading independent oil and gas firms. Fundamentally, this fact alone should draw intrigue among forward-thinking investors.According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, households in the nation are likely to spend more this winter than in previous cold seasons. One of the factors involved centers on slightly colder weather this year than last. Cynically, this dynamic might help boost DVN, even though shares already jumped more than 48% on a year-to-date basis.Devon features a current yield of 6.81%, which rates very generously compared to the energy sector’s average yield of 4.2%. Also, the payout ratio, while high at 59%, isn’t egregiously so. Still, a recent payout decrease means that Devon is back to square one regarding its consecutive dividend track record.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

54,1518480d-551d-3efb-9d26-0a28e7699ad1,MRK,2022-12-04,Merck (NYSE:MRK) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.73,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-nyse-mrk-increasing-dividend-131151078.html,1670073111,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 9th of January to $0.73. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.7%. Check out our latest analysis for Merck Merck's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Merck's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 38.5%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 36%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMerck Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.68 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.7% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Merck has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 42% per annum. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Merck could prove to be a strong dividend payer.Merck Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

56,42cef115-5c30-395f-90c9-28737f505eca,CI,2022-12-04,Is Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) Trading At A 45% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporation-nyse-ci-trading-140016881.html,1670076016,STORY,['CI'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$10.0bUS$8.60bUS$9.01bUS$9.14bUS$9.28bUS$9.44bUS$9.61bUS$9.79bUS$9.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.44%Est @ 1.6%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$7.7kUS$8.8kUS$7.1kUS$7.0kUS$6.6kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$219bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$219b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$115bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$181b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$327, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.907. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Cigna, there are three fundamental items you should further examine:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Cigna .Future Earnings: How does CI's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Given that the average selling price of US$44.44 is still lower than the current share price, insiders would probably have been better off keeping their shares.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$45.94. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Wells Fargo insiders own 0.06% of the company, currently worth about US$103m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Wells Fargo that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the plight of the world and go directly to 5 Biggest Issues in the World and The Companies Working on Solving Them.The world is currently going through several crises, most of which are exacerbating each other. On November 15, 2022, the world population hit 8 billion people. All other things constant, it is expected to reach 10 billion people in 2050, according to UN forecasts. Growing population means more resource consumption. As economic growth around the world leads to rising living standards, consumption is expected to skyrocket. The UN International Resources Panel estimates that resource-use per person in 2050 will be 75% higher than it is today. Even in the present day, humanity is consuming resources 1.8 times faster than Earth’s biocapacity can regenerate, according to Overshoot Today. The ecological footprint of an average American is 8.1 Global Hectares (gha) per person, while Earth’s biocapacity is only 1.6 gha per person. If everyone consumed like the average American, we would need 5 Earths.A landmark MIT study done in 1972 accounted for interacting variables such as natural resources, population growth rate, food production/supply, industrial output, and pollution, in a system-dynamics computer model and showed that our default business-as-usual trajectory leads to overshoot and global system collapse somewhere in the mid-21st century. The data from 38 years since the study confirmed its findings in another study done in 2020. These are stark problems and have created demand for technological solutions, which is where the free market comes in to respond. Many established, as well as startup companies are attempting to solve these problems.For instance, climate change has resulted in the emergence of the carbon-capture industry (because we’re also destroying the natural carbon sinks, forests) made up of companies attempting to develop efficient and scalable carbon-capture technologies. Notable among these are Aker Carbon Capture ASA (OSLO:ACC.OL) and Carbfix. While some companies are actively trying to solve climate change, others like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing so passively, by adopting climate-friendly policies. Story continuesNow that we understand the background, let’s move on to the list of 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them.Photo by OCG Saving The Ocean on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 10 biggest issues in the world and the companies working on solving them, we’ve consulted the UN’s Global-Issues list, and selected the ones that are the most globally consequential. For companies trying to solve them, we’ve used data from various forward-focused media organizations like The Verge, Tech Crunch, Gizmodo and Mashable.10. Gender EqualityGender disparity is still among the biggest issues in the world in 21st century, especially in the global south. Most of it results from the gender roles assigned to both biological sexes, where women get the worse end of the bargain.According to data from UNICEF, girls aged 10-14 are twice as likely to spend an average of 21 hours per week on household tasks than boys of the same age worldwide.The world is also missing out on the full potential of one-half of its population. The ILO report on gender gap in employment shows women represent only 47% of the workforce around the world while men make up 72% of it as of 2022. Many large market-cap companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are taking the initiative in gender inclusion and hiring more and more women for gender equity. An AI startup, called Pipeline, has also been one of the companies working on solving the issue. It has been making headlines for developing algorithms that help HR departments avoid hiring patterns which are systematically biased against intersectional female gender. 9. MisinformationMisinformation is one of the most pressing problems of the 21st century. It is having a corrosive effect on democracies and institutional trust, not only in the developing world but in the developed world as well, and leading to a rise in populism. Misinformation is also central to the present-day disdain for expertise. Its most recent example in the US was the response to the pandemic from some sections of the society. A significant number of people believed that pandemic lockdowns and vaccination were an excuse for “globalists” to take control of the society and microchip people for surveillance. A survey conducted by YouGov in collaboration with The Economist showed that one in five Americans held this belief. Misinformation spreads much faster through digital and social media platforms, which is why many digital technology companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), ByteDance and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have introduced various methods to detect and remove misinformation from their products’ platforms. 8. Wealth InequalityWealth inequality between countries, and between individuals within countries are among the biggest issues in the world. In terms of wealth inequality between individuals, the richest global 1% own 46% of the global wealth according to Inequality.org. For perspective, in 2018, it only took 26 billionaires to hold as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the entire world. High income inequality has been found to be linked with increased risk of economic instability and financial crises. Further, in developed nations, life expectancy and levels of physical health are often lower due to income inequality.Many startups have started to emerge that are working on solving the problem. One such startup is Pioneer. Its solution to wealth inequality is entrepreneurship. It hosts a sizable online competition every month where people present their projects like startups, books and research projects. These projects can be digitally voted for, by other members, adding points for advancement. Projects with highest points are evaluated at the end of the month and a dozen or so are selected for funding, backed by Marc Andreessen. 7. HealthGlobal health is in crisis, especially in the developing world, due to lack of proper medical resources, hygiene and socio-political issues. Apart from these two factors, many diseases have been wreaking havoc without a cure. Cancer, for instance, takes 1 out of 6 lives in the world every year, according to Webmd.com. In parts of the world like Africa, the threat of another viral outbreak is ever present. The two recent outbreaks, of Ebola Virus and Zika Virus, occurred in 2013 and 2015, respectively, contributing to a 63% increase in zoonotic diseases on the continent from 2012-2022, according to WHO.The Covid-19 outbreak, which has claimed nearly 7 million lives as of 2022, also showed the world how unprepared it is to deal with outbreaks of airborne viruses, despite their statistical inevitability. Many companies are working to tackle the rising threat of global health crises. These include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is known for developing Ervebo, the vaccine for Ebola Virus that contained its spread. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is known for its contribution to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first vaccine to roll out for Covid-19. 6. PovertyExtreme poverty is one of the biggest humanitarian issues in the world. According to World Vision, around 9.2% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, and make less than $1.90 a day. A number of startup companies have emerged as of late to alleviate suffering caused by poverty. One such startup is Unhoused.org. It is a London-based retailer that sells items like clothes, dental kits, and other consumer products. For every product it sells, it donates the same to an organization helping the homeless community. Another startup, known as Wagestream, lets the workers of companies which are subscribed to it, tap into their incomes at any time of the month so they can accommodate their ongoing needs. The company has received significant investment from people like Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also significantly contributed to tackling extreme poverty. Google has contributed $50 million to the global education project and $50 million to the economic opportunity initiative in the battle against extreme poverty.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over Target's (NYSE:TGT) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Target is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$56b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, Target has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Target roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Target compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 15% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 25% in that time. 15% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Target has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Another thing to note, Target has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 43%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Story continuesIn Conclusion...The main thing to remember is that Target has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 201% return they've received over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.One final note, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Target (including 1 which can't be ignored) .While Target isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

There’s no better way to do so than to look at some retail stocks to buy whose share prices were once shining brightly but have fallen on hard times in 2022.The holiday season officially got started on Thanksgiving Day. However, with many retailers opting to close for the holiday, Black Friday was the real opening day of this year’s holiday season. It’s now a sprint to Christmas Eve. Retail experts’ early reports suggest traffic on Black Friday, while brisk, wasn’t a grand slam home run, with few long lines or packed mall parking lots emerging from the long weekend of shopping. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA big winner on Black Friday this year was online shopping. According to Adobe Analytics data, Americans spent more than $9.1 billion online on Friday, 2.3% higher than last year.To make my list of three fallen-star stocks to buy heading into the holidays, a retail stock must be down in 2022 while up in 2021. Happy Holidays! AMZNAmazon$92.22HDHome Depot$313.74TGTTarget$165.94Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThere was a time when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock could do no wrong. Down nearly 45% in 2022, investors are beginning to have doubts about the e-commerce giant, despite the fact that its AWS (Amazon Web Services) business continues to generate huge profits. Things have gotten so bad for Amazon that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) got more online searches on Black Friday this year. On Black Friday in 2021, Amazon finished first in online searches for Black Friday discounts. This year, Amazon came fourth behind Walmart and two other omnichannel retailers. Despite the woes faced by Amazon — it doesn’t help that it laid off 10,000 employees in November — its overall businesses remain strong. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton had good things to say about Amazon in mid-November, suggesting that it’s still the best e-commerce stock to bet on heading into 2022. Morton has an outperform rating for Amazon with a $118 target price, 24% higher than where it’s currently trading.Story continuesOf the 51 analysts covering Amazon stock, 48 rate it as “overweight” or an outright buy. The average target price is $137, 48.8% higher than its current share price. It’s expected to earn $1.83 in fiscal 2023. One segment to keep an eye on is advertising. In 2021, its ad business grew 58% to more than $31 billion, trailing only Google and Facebook in the lucrative U.S. online ad market. It is now the company’s second-biggest profit generator behind AWS, providing it with an excellent one-two profit punch.Buying under $100 will pay dividends in the long run.Home Depot (HD)earnings reports hdSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comNext on my list of stocks to buy is a home improvement giant. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) gained 56% in 2021 due to a booming housing market. In 2022, as housing has seen an accelerated slowdown due to rising interest rates, HD stock is down more than 30% year-to-date. On the top line, the home improvement retailer delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results on Nov. 15. Revenue was $38.9 billion, nearly 6.0% higher than a year earlier, and $870 million better than the consensus estimate. On the bottom line, it earned $4.24 in Q3 2022, 10 cents higher than analyst estimates. Despite the economy appearing to slow, Home Depot is confident that it will weather the storm as homeowners spend more time at home, justifying home renovation projects. Home Depot director Paula Santilli recently purchased 1,583 shares on the open market for $315.80 a share. That is Santilli’s first open market purchase since joining the board on March 1. So far in 2022, she’s also received 799 deferred shares, which vest after she’s left the board.There’s only one reason a director buys shares on the open market: They think the shares are good value. In November, Home Depot’s competitor Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) sold its Canadian operations to private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $400 million. Lowe’s paid 3.2 billion CAD in 2016 for Rona Inc. (TSX:RON) to make it more competitive in Canada. That didn’t materialize, with Home Depot’s 202 Canadian stores taking the lion’s share of the Canadian market. The 35 analysts that cover HD stock give it an average rating of “overweight“ with a $346.30 target price. Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target storeSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) stock is down more than 27% YTD. While Walmart is kicking butt in 2022, Target’s been taken to the woodshed. On Nov. 15, Walmart raised its outlook for 2022, reporting 8.2% same-store sales growth, excluding fuel. At the same time, Target cut its forecast after same-store sales only increased by 2.7% in its Q3 2022 report. The reason for the difference in same-store sales growth: Walmart generates 56% of its revenue from groceries, while Target’s grocery business accounts for approximately 20%. Inflation has people shopping at Walmart that generally wouldn’t. However, as CEO Brian Cornell said in its Q3 2022 conference call, the company is changing its business to deal with a more price-sensitive consumer. Cornell believes that Target can save between $2 billion and $3 billion over the next three years from its changes. While the consumer might focus more on grocery items now, Target continues to remodel its stores to improve the customer experience. By the end of 2022, it will have completed about 200 full remodels and opened 23 new locations, including opening a larger 150,000-square-foot prototype in Houston. “At nearly 150,000 square feet, this new format incorporates our latest thinking in store design, featuring a more open layout, localized elements to inspire and serve our guests, 5x more space to support our digital fulfillment services and sustainable features in support of our Target-forward goals,” stated COO John Mulligan.Investors should expect Target to add more of these larger locations. Once inflation subsides or levels off, these stores should add to their bottom line. All of this puts it squarely on my list of retail stocks to buy for 2023 growth. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Intuitive Surgical, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Intuitive Surgical compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Intuitive Surgical, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 20%, but since then they've fallen to 14%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Intuitive Surgical is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 115% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.While Intuitive Surgical doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation  on our platform.While Intuitive Surgical isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks under $50 to buy, go directly to 5 Stocks Under $50 to Buy Now.According to the Labor Department on Friday, the U.S economy gained 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%. Furthermore, the average hourly pay rose 5.1% year over year in November, a welcome increase for workers who have to deal with inflation.In terms of inflation, October's core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 5% year over year versus September's rise of 5.2% year over year. The metric, which is favored by the Federal Reserve, was better than some expectations and indicated that inflation could potentially be peaking.Perhaps in part due to the good October core inflation data, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in late November, ""Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down. The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”With slower interest rate increases, potentially peaking inflation, and a still strong job market, the broader market has rallied recently with the S&amp;P 500 index up almost 14% from its October lows.While the data has been more positive of late, many wonder if inflation will stay high for longer than what the market is expecting or if interest rates will go higher than what the market is pricing in.Indeed, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers recently said that the thought interest rates might need to increase more than the market is judging.If interest rates stay high for too long or they rise too high, there's a chance that the economy might enter into a recession and many stocks might not do so well. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Stocks Under $50 to Buy Now, we picked 10 companies with earnings growth potential and we ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Stocks Under $50 to Buy Now10. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) is a regional bank whose shares have rallied from under $7.25 to $15.46 on December 3. Although shares of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) could have downside if there is a recession next year, the bank remains attractive long term given its normalized earnings power. Out of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 23 were long Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) at the end of Q3 2022.Alongside Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), and CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX), Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) is a stock under $50 that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) is a consumer beverage company that has seen shares more than triple since 2014. Oakmark Global Fund describes Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)'s long term business potential in a Q4 2020 investor letter,Keurig Dr Pepper is one of North America’s leading beverage companies and commands dominant positions in single-serve coffee and flavored sodas. We believe single-serve coffee pods will capture almost all of the incremental growth in at-home coffee consumption. Many consumers find that K-Cups offer better convenience, quality, variety and value, compared to drip brewing. Keurig’s competitive advantages (low-cost production, the largest installed base of brewers, exclusive brand partnerships) allow it to collect a toll on most pods sold in North America. The company’s soda franchises remain highly profitable, and we do not expect health-related concerns about sugar to materially impact consumption trends. We believe that Keurig’s brands should deliver steady growth, consistent market share gains and significant excess cash.Given Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)'s stock performance since 2021, Oakmark Global Fund's description as been accurate so far. There could be more growth in the future if Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) maintains its market share.8.

(NYSE:V) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-institutional-ownership-visa-inc-120029312.html,1670155229,STORY,['V'],"[If you want to know who really controls Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Visa. Check out our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Visa's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Visa is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.0% of shares outstanding. With 6.0% and 3.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of VisaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Visa Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$234m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Visa. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Visa better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Visa  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Since these two countries are major producers of several metals such as copper, iron and nickel while also being involved in other raw materials extraction such as of palladium, neon and platinum. When the war started, the supply of these metals was affected which led to an increase in prices. Prices also soared amid the West's sanctions on Russia.

(NYSE:APD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 85% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-inc-nyse-110050076.html,1670151650,STORY,['APD'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Air Products and Chemicals. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Air Products and Chemicals. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Air Products and Chemicals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Air Products and Chemicals. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.6% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$248m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Air Products and Chemicals. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NASDAQ:QLYS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions. Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a trusted security and compliance partner for some of the world’s largest enterprises, including Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and national healthcare institutions among others. The company is profitable and cash-rich and is one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy heading into 2023. According to the company's balance sheet, Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) has free cash flows of $177.8 million, a trailing twelve-month operating margin of 27.51%, and an ROE of 26.77%.On November 3, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives updated his price target on Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) to $140 from $150 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares.At the close of Q3 2022, 25 hedge funds were long Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) and disclosed stakes worth $295.5 million. Of those, Fundsmith LLP was the most prominent investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $92.19 million.Here is what Headwaters Capital had to say about Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise, end-points, cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses, it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently, QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021.The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection, the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity, which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically, cybersecurity was best served by firewalls, which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter, the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM, VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways, vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities.Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM, industry tailwinds and a market leading product, QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive, QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&amp;D or its sales force. R&amp;D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&amp;M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently, QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)Big tech companies that are heavily investing in cybersecurity include Meta Platforms, Inc.

The U.S. Army is CACI’s single largest customer. This position replaces BWXT in Upslope’s “defense basket” (articulated in Q1 on p. 4). CACI’s business is mostly split across Expertise (providing talent to government agencies – e.g. software engineers) and Technology (design and delivery of specific technology-oriented services and products, including for example, battlefield hardware). The company offers its services and products in support of both day-to-day agency operations and specific missions.At a high-level, CACI reminds me of another Upslope long in an unrelated sector: Silgan Holdings (packaging/dispensing and food can business). Both are truly sleepy value stocks that trade for low doubledigit earnings multiples, but have a strong history of steady value creation and free cash flow per share growth. Both the stocks and underlying businesses appear very well-positioned for the uncertain macro (or geopolitical, in CACI’s case) environment we’re likely to face in the years ahead. Other notable thesis points for CACI specifically:Long-term Geopolitical &amp; Other Tailwinds – like other components of Upslope’s defense basket, CACI should benefit from an attractive defense spending environment for years to come. CACI should also benefit from IT modernization efforts in U.S. government agencies, as well as its strength in cyber/electronic warfare offerings…” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Colgate-Palmolive could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Colgate-Palmolive will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Colgate-Palmolive's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 27%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 15% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 17% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Colgate-Palmolive is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From Colgate-Palmolive's P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Colgate-Palmolive's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive  that you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

82,de125460-9693-3fca-af19-8cc62f8d2f4f,JNPR,2022-12-04,Returns On Capital At Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) Paint A Concerning Picture,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-juniper-networks-nyse-122500894.html,1670156700,STORY,['JNPR'],"[To avoid investing in a business that's in decline, there's a few financial metrics that can provide early indications of aging. Businesses in decline often have two underlying trends, firstly, a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining base of capital employed. This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking. Having said that, after a brief look, Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Juniper Networks, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.071 = US$501m ÷ (US$9.0b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Juniper Networks has an ROCE of 7.1%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.7% average generated by the Communications industry. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Juniper Networks compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Juniper Networks' ROCE Trend?In terms of Juniper Networks' historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. About five years ago, returns on capital were 12%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Juniper Networks to turn into a multi-bagger.Story continuesOur Take On Juniper Networks' ROCEIn summary, it's unfortunate that Juniper Networks is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. Despite the concerning underlying trends, the stock has actually gained 34% over the last five years, so it might be that the investors are expecting the trends to reverse. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Juniper Networks  that we think you should be aware of.While Juniper Networks isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

83,0b31d5cb-fd19-3f72-ac08-480276f19ccd,CMCSA,2022-12-04,Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Delivered A Weaker ROE Than Its Industry,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-delivered-110023121.html,1670151623,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.2% = US$5.0b ÷ US$81b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.Does Comcast Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Media industry classification.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Comcast by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Comcast's Debt And Its 6.2% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Comcast, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.20. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

While growth-oriented names provide the most excitement, market participants must acknowledge reality. As prior monetary policy dramatically expanded the money supply, the Federal Reserve must act aggressively to control inflation. That’s bad for growth but a relative positive for established passive-income-offering companies.Generally speaking, the enterprises undergirding dividend stocks to buy feature established businesses with strong profitability track records. After all, those dividends must come from somewhere. Further, as some officials suggest that the benchmark interest rate might rise, growth names might become red-shirted in 2023. With limited viable options available, astute investors will likely target these dividend stocks to buy this winter.KRKroger$49.34HDHome Depot$322.31MCDMcDonald’s$272.48MDTMedtronic$78.48HPQHP.$29.99VZVerizon$38.94DVNDevon Energy$68.64Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comNothing brings out the holiday festivities like good food to share among friends and family. Naturally, then, Kroger (NYSE:KR) offers an excellent narrative for dividend stocks to buy this winter. Aside from the holiday angle, Kroger’s grocery store business also plays into the trade-down effect or the meeting of needs through cheaper alternatives. Stated differently, economic pressures may force those eating at expensive restaurants to cook for themselves, thus bolstering KR.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegarding its passive income, Dividend.com notes that Kroger features a forward yield of 2.11%. While not the most generous, it does exceed the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio – or the proportion of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to net income – is only 24.9%. This implies long-term stability and dependability.Story continuesTo be fair, Gurufocus.com labels KR as modestly overvalued. However, the market prices KR at 12-times forward earnings, whereas the sector median is 16.4 times. From this angle, then, Kroger brings an attractive proposition as one of the dividend stocks to buy.Home Depot (HD)an interior view of a house attic under constructionSource: ronstik / Shutterstock.comOne of the underappreciated holiday plays, shoppers can go to Home Depot (NYSE:HD) for their Christmas trees and similar accoutrements. In addition, the brown stuff hitting the proverbial fan doesn’t abide by artificial human standards. When a pipe breaks, it will break when the laws of physics dictate. Therefore, winter season or not, Home Depot enjoys everyday relevance.Specifically as one of the dividend stocks to buy, the home improvement retailer features a forward yield of 2.41%. Again, it’s not the most generous yield, though it does beat the sector’s average of 1.89%. Furthermore, Home Depot has increased its dividend 142 times. Therefore, while the payout ratio is on the “warm” side of things at 44.8%, it offers reliable passive income.Even better, according to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculation of fair market value (FMV), HD rates as modestly undervalued. Against traditional financial metrics, Home Depot’s return on asset is 22.8%, beating out over 97% of the competition. This also reflects a very high-quality business.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockNo matter what your belief systems, the winter season centers on the importance of family. In that respect, the coronavirus pandemic and the catapulting of work-from-home initiatives essentially created a two-year holiday season. However, with perhaps most companies scheduled to bring back workers to the office in 2023, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) might be an underappreciated beneficiary.As a CNBC report pointed out, people returning to the office provided strong demand for breakfast products even as they cut back on other expenditures. Now, this report came out in late August of this year. Imagine, then, that say 90% of workers were forced to return to the office at least part of the time. Not only that, these folks wouldn’t have much of a choice if they want to save their jobs in a recession.Fundamentally, this dynamic augurs well for MCD as one of the dividend stocks to buy. Currently, it features a forward yield of 2.24%. In addition, the Golden Arches enjoys 45 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will want to keep.Medtronic (MDT)Doctor or physician calculating a patients medical bills at a desk. Medical bills, health costs, health expenses.Source: THICHA SATAPITANON / ShutterstockA medical device company, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) may provide a feel-good narrative for the holiday season. Among its many products, Medtronic features solutions for diabetes patients, enabling these folks to effectively manage their condition. Again, with the winter months putting a focus on family, MDT offers something to think about.To be fair, though, prospective participants must own a contrarian spirit. Several days ago, Medtronic delivered disappointing results for its fiscal second-quarter sales, citing slower procedure and supply recovery. As a result, management lowered its earnings forecast for the year. Still, at some point, its core markets will likely recover. When they do, MDT may offer substantial upside.For now, the company ranks among the dividend stocks to buy this winter. Per Dividend.com, Medtronic features a forward yield of 3.56%. This rates conspicuously higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. While the payout ratio is on the higher side at 51.4%, MDT also commands 45 years of consecutive dividend increases.HP (HPQ)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockWhen you’re dealing with consumer electronics, particularly hardware providers like HP (NYSE:HPQ), its upside narrative presents risks. Unfortunately, consumer sentiment ranks poorly at the moment, imposing potential headwinds on HPQ. Nevertheless, the underlying company represents one of the dividend stocks to buy for its potential to positively surprise onlookers.Recently, statements by Federal Reserve officials suggest that the central bank might sustain aggressive interest rate hikes. If so, the previously rising labor market may come under fire. And that may force employees to encounter an ultimatum: return to the office or quit. Some folks will choose the latter, which then boosts the gig economy. In turn, the rise of white-collar independent contractors may catalyze demand for HP’s computer products.Admittedly, it’s a narrative that requires multiple stars to align but it’s within the realm of possibility. Further, the company provides a forward yield of 3.64%. This ranks well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, HP’s payout ratio is 31.5%, which is very healthy. Thus, it’s one of the dividend stocks to buy this winter.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockAs a telecommunications specialist, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) enjoys an obvious play as a holiday-related enterprise. Again, the season centers on connecting with loved ones, fitting right into Verizon’s core business offering. To be fair, though, VZ stock has seen better days. Since the start of the year, shares fell nearly 27%. If that wasn’t enough of a warning, Gurufocus.com warns that Verizon represents a possible value trap. For instance,  while the market prices VZ at only 7.6-times forward earnings, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 0.5%. That’s rather pedestrian, making the prospect of the company hitting its income-statement-related performance targets rather suspect.Still, if you’re looking for dividend stocks to buy, Verizon may appeal to speculators. According to Dividend.com, the company carries a forward yield of 6.8%. This ranks much higher than the communication sector’s average yield of 2.62%. Also, the enterprise commands 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management won’t give up without a fight.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOne of the hottest performers among dividend stocks to buy, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) benefitted from a relevancy surge. Specializing in hydrocarbon exploration, Devon represents one of the leading independent oil and gas firms. Fundamentally, this fact alone should draw intrigue among forward-thinking investors.According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, households in the nation are likely to spend more this winter than in previous cold seasons. One of the factors involved centers on slightly colder weather this year than last. Cynically, this dynamic might help boost DVN, even though shares already jumped more than 48% on a year-to-date basis.Devon features a current yield of 6.81%, which rates very generously compared to the energy sector’s average yield of 4.2%. Also, the payout ratio, while high at 59%, isn’t egregiously so. Still, a recent payout decrease means that Devon is back to square one regarding its consecutive dividend track record.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) share price is 127% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 23% in about a quarter.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).United Rentals was able to grow its EPS at 25% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 31% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on United Rentals' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that United Rentals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 7.1% over one year. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 17% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

88,83f96b98-8a83-3031-81a3-87989d719c10,AON,2022-12-04,Aon (NYSE:AON) shareholders have earned a 18% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aon-nyse-aon-shareholders-earned-120159667.html,1670155319,STORY,['AON'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Aon plc (NYSE:AON) stock is up an impressive 122% over the last five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 11%. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 9.1% in the last month.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Aon In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Aon achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 36% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Aon's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Aon the TSR over the last 5 years was 132%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Aon shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 5.5% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 18% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Aon (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, sold US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$157. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year.

This makes one think the business has some good points.Does American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. American Express insiders own about US$135m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, American Express insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Take a look at wheat futures. You will see a year-to-date here-- wheat futures relatively flat for the year. Oat futures are down 47% year-to-date. Even coffee futures are lower year-to-date, down 27%.So what is happening here? Because people are not seeing these lower prices in commodities translate to their grocery bills. You've got food inflation that is up roughly 12% year-over-year. Well, food producers, they're hesitant to lower their prices because of uncertainty when it comes to grain-- often, that output, grains are planted for the following year.So there's been a lot of turmoil with the situation with Ukraine. Also, the energy prices-- those are still relatively high, even though they have come off their highs. But energy is a big factor when it comes to food, especially when you're talking about farmers planting.They use diesel, and diesel has not come off its prices as much as gasoline has from their highs from earlier this year. Farmers use diesel, and also transportation is in diesel as well. So a lot of this takes about 3 to six months to translate into grocery bills.I did speak to a produce producer who was telling me that the prices at shipping points, those are down. But that doesn't reflect on the wholesale prices or supermarket prices also, because that takes time. There's a lag there as well, because you also have inventory at supermarkets that you need to clear out first before you bring in those other products, guys.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Cramer's market predictions, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim Cramer. The investing landscape has widely transformed this year as recession fears pull investors toward previously overlooked defensive securities. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC, advises investors to invest in profitable companies that have strong shareholder returns. In addition to this, he also talked about loading up on high-yielding dividend stocks in one of his shows recorded in late September.In one of his recent shows in October, Cramer mentioned that tech stocks have fallen this year because of the tightening monetary policy. However, the decline in tech stocks opens new investment avenues for investors where they can take refuge in other sectors. According to Cramer, some of the industries that investors should focus on include fossil fuels, healthcare, travel, defense, and food and beverage.According to Cramer, the continuous interest rate hikes this year indicate that the trend will likely continue for the rest of the year. This eventually increases the risks of a possible recession. He further mentioned that though the rapidly rising treasury yields have put pressure on dividend stocks, they still offer better investment opportunities than the rest of the market. He mentioned that investors should steadily build their position in dividends to gain maximum profits.Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors this year as many companies reinstated and raised their payouts after the pandemic of 2020. According to the third quarter report of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set record payments in Q3 and saw an 8.5% growth from the same period last year. The report also highlighted that dividends are expected to reach their record by the next quarter. Some of the most popular dividend stocks include Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as they have raised their dividends for a long time.Story continuesIn view of the above-stated arguments and to further expand upon Cramer’s investment strategy, we will discuss the best dividend stocks according to Jim Cramer.Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim CramerOur Methodology:We selected dividend stocks from some of Jim Cramer's recent programs in which he recommended these securities.

Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks According To Jim Cramer. Suggested articles:12 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy15 Biggest European Pharmaceutical Companies10 Biggest Diamond Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

(NYSE:WM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 3.3% last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 5.7% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Waste Management. See our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Waste Management already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Waste Management's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Waste Management. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.5% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Waste Management, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$123m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Selling at an average price of US$245, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Stryker The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StrykerIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the VP &amp; CFO, Glenn Boehnlein, sold US$606k worth of shares at a price of US$261 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$243. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Stryker didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Stryker Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Stryker shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$268k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of StrykerI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Stryker insiders own 11% of the company, worth about US$10b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Stryker Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Stryker makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Stryker and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Sure, some indicators suggest that the central bank might loosen its stance. However, in the bigger picture, folks must deal with reality. Following an unprecedented expansion of the money supply, the Fed must control act aggressively.Don’t take my word for it. Instead, just listen to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who insists on a higher target policy rate. “We’ve got a ways to go to get restrictive,” he said in an interview with MarketWatch. That’s not great news for growth-oriented names. But it could spell good tidings (at least relatively speaking) for stocks to buy for rising interest rates.AFLAflac$72.09PGRProgressive$132.17SRESempra Energy$165.06PSXPhillips 66$109.09ABAllianceBernstein$40.30DFSDiscover Financial$107.66ARCCAres Capital$19.60InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAflac (AFL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn insurance specialist, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) represents the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the U.S. While the company underwrites a range of policy requests, it’s perhaps best known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage. This service pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness, per the company’s public profile.Fundamentally, AFL makes a strong case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates because of fears of unknown variables. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of a worldwide outbreak leading to mass pandemonium was either exclusive to history books or Hollywood dramas. Given that it became a harsh reality, people now take supplemental insurance coverage much more seriously.To be fair, Gurufocus.com labels AFL as significantly overvalued. On a year-to-date basis, AFL jumped nearly 22%. Also, in the trailing month, it’s up almost 9%. Nevertheless, AFL still trades at 9-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings, which sits below the sector median of 12 times. Combined with its fundamental relevance, AFL ranks as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Story continuesProgressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWell known for its quirky commercials featuring the fictional salesperson character Flo, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) represents the third largest insurance carrier and the number one commercial auto insurer in the U.S. Fundamentally, insurance stocks and benchmark rates generally feature a direct correlation: as one rises, so too does the other.Now, certain circumstances such as market volatility and other critical headwinds may disrupt this relationship. Nevertheless, as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates, PGR makes an excellent case for itself because of the underlying business. Simply put, according to Progressive’s website, nearly every state requires car insurance coverage. The lone state that doesn’t – Massachusetts – still requires proof of financial responsibility.In other words, Progressive cynically enjoys a captive audience. Further, with the post-pandemic new normal imposing ramped up dangers on the road, insurance becomes even more critical. Therefore, PGR easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Sempra Energy (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Most folks I talk to love the Golden State, particularly Southern California. With excellent weather year-round and plenty of stuff to do, it’s a dream experience for many. However, great experiences come at a cost. While many residents complain about the metaphorical sunshine tax, it’s actually a real thing. Enter Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE).Representing one of the largest utility holding companies in the U.S., Sempra commands a massive footprint of about 40 million customers. Further, these households tend to generate higher-than-average income compared to the rest of the nation. As well, because California represents a highly desired destination state – conservative talking points be damned – Sempra knows it owns a hostage audience.Because of this permanent demand structure, SRE cynically ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. While I get that people are moving out of California in droves, there are also plenty of higher-income folks moving in. Thus, SRE will continue to enjoy tremendous relevance.Phillips 66 (PSX)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comWith Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), investors will want to exercise caution through careful entry into the market. A multinational energy firm, Phillips 66 mainly specializes in the downstream component of the industry. This deals with segments such as refining and marketing. However, rising borrowing costs tend to be negative for commodities, including energy resources. Therefore, you may want to tiptoe into PSX shares.Indeed, the circumstances become more complicated because of the underlying market performance. Since the start of the year, PSX gained nearly 44% of equity value. Also, in the trialing month, it’s up 4.5%. In other words, interested investors may want to wait a bit until shares cool down before pulling the trigger.Nevertheless, the broader fundamentals should bode well for PSX, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. With possibly 90% of companies requiring a return to the office (at least partially), this circumstance will boost mobility statistics. Of course, mobility on the freeways isn’t free, thus benefitting PSX.AllianceBernstein (AB)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comIn prior InvestorPlace articles, I’ve mentioned the bullish case for AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), typically because outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rates AB shares highly. However, as a candidate among stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m sure many folks remain skeptical. After all, AllianceBernstein represents a global asset management firm. Its job becomes much more difficult during a deflationary cycle.And believe me, should the Fed continue to shrink the money supply via raising borrowing costs, this action is deflationary: fewer dollars chasing after more goods. Under this scenario, several publicly traded securities may stumble because of business erosion.Still, AB could be a surprise idea among stocks to buy for rising interest rates because of societal realities. AllianceBernstein caters to high-net-worth individuals, meaning that the enterprise uses only the best resources. It also only hires the best advisors. Combine the two and you have one of the few asset managers that can guide their clients successfully through this deflationary storm. Just imagine the powerful word of mouth that such a success story can generate.Discover Financial (DFS)Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a ""BUY NOW!"" button on a laptop keyboard.Source: ShutterstockAlthough Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) tends to be overlooked relative to its more popular competitors within the financial services space, DFS is well worth consideration among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. On an elemental and cynical level, Discover pads its bottom line when interest rates rise. Further, as economic pressures build, people tend to resort to credit to make ends meet.Again, it’s a cynical argument and I’m not celebrating this dynamic. Rather, I’m pointing out the harsh truth. For instance, after the level of consumer loans dropped to a multi-year low of $739 billion in April 2021, this metric skyrocketed to $928 billion this month. Interestingly, consumer loans hit over $859 billion just before the coronavirus pandemic capsized American society.Personally, it appears that rising consumer debt amid significant economic ambiguities represents a danger point. Still, for the near and intermediate term, it’s quite possible that DFS qualifies as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Bluntly speaking, DFS will benefit until it doesn’t.Ares Capital (ARCC)BUY spelled out on a computer keyboard representing stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOn a final note, if you want to take a pot shot regarding stocks to buy for rising interest rates, you could check out Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC). Billed as a leading business development company (BDC) with a focus on comprehensive financing solutions for middle-market enterprises, Ares might seem a risky venture under the current environment. After all, companies tend to fail during deflationary cycles.Nevertheless, Wall Street remains relatively warm to ARCC stock. No, it’s not in positive territory. However, with an 8% loss for the year – compared to more than 17% down for the S&amp;P 500 – Ares currently holds its own. As well, ARCC appears to have arrested its decline, fading just barely under parity in the trailing half-year period.Fundamentally, Ares rescue-financing business – which targets enterprises featuring a market capitalization of between $20 and $200 million – could be enticing. Because these companies don’t have the same access to capital markets as an established blue chip, Ares can forge a robust niche.It’s risky but sometimes, you need to take some wagers to enjoy big gains in this type of market.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

101,88e9a3d1-9604-3e07-9e50-ff6cd5ff8c16,GE,2022-12-04,General Electric (NYSE:GE) investors are sitting on a loss of 33% if they invested five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-nyse-ge-investors-130100281.html,1670158860,STORY,['GE'],"[While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) share price has gained 20% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 39% in that time, significantly under-performing the market.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.The modest 0.4% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. It could be that the revenue decline of 10.0% per year is viewed as evidence that General Electric is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for General Electric in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, General Electric's TSR for the last 5 years was -33%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that General Electric shares lost 6.0% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 14%. What is more upsetting is the 6% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. While the losses are slowing we doubt many shareholders are happy with the stock. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

For instance, after the level of consumer loans dropped to a multi-year low of $739 billion in April 2021, this metric skyrocketed to $928 billion this month. Interestingly, consumer loans hit over $859 billion just before the coronavirus pandemic capsized American society.Personally, it appears that rising consumer debt amid significant economic ambiguities represents a danger point. Still, for the near and intermediate term, it’s quite possible that DFS qualifies as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Bluntly speaking, DFS will benefit until it doesn’t.Ares Capital (ARCC)BUY spelled out on a computer keyboard representing stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOn a final note, if you want to take a pot shot regarding stocks to buy for rising interest rates, you could check out Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC). Billed as a leading business development company (BDC) with a focus on comprehensive financing solutions for middle-market enterprises, Ares might seem a risky venture under the current environment. After all, companies tend to fail during deflationary cycles.Nevertheless, Wall Street remains relatively warm to ARCC stock. No, it’s not in positive territory. However, with an 8% loss for the year – compared to more than 17% down for the S&amp;P 500 – Ares currently holds its own. As well, ARCC appears to have arrested its decline, fading just barely under parity in the trailing half-year period.Fundamentally, Ares rescue-financing business – which targets enterprises featuring a market capitalization of between $20 and $200 million – could be enticing.

105,c1799cef-1db6-369a-bdbf-9696af1985fa,ETN,2022-12-04,Possible bearish signals as Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) insiders disposed of US$4.0m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-eaton-corporation-130111742.html,1670158871,STORY,['ETN'],"[Over the past year, many Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton Eaton Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, April Boise, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$139 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$163, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 43% of April Boise's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Eaton shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Eaton Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Eaton shares. In total, Executive VP &amp; CFO Thomas Okray dumped US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Eaton insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$217m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Eaton Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Eaton stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since Eaton is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Eaton that deserve your attention before buying any shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Sure, some indicators suggest that the central bank might loosen its stance. However, in the bigger picture, folks must deal with reality. Following an unprecedented expansion of the money supply, the Fed must control act aggressively.Don’t take my word for it. Instead, just listen to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who insists on a higher target policy rate. “We’ve got a ways to go to get restrictive,” he said in an interview with MarketWatch. That’s not great news for growth-oriented names. But it could spell good tidings (at least relatively speaking) for stocks to buy for rising interest rates.AFLAflac$72.09PGRProgressive$132.17SRESempra Energy$165.06PSXPhillips 66$109.09ABAllianceBernstein$40.30DFSDiscover Financial$107.66ARCCAres Capital$19.60InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAflac (AFL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn insurance specialist, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) represents the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the U.S. While the company underwrites a range of policy requests, it’s perhaps best known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage. This service pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness, per the company’s public profile.Fundamentally, AFL makes a strong case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates because of fears of unknown variables. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of a worldwide outbreak leading to mass pandemonium was either exclusive to history books or Hollywood dramas. Given that it became a harsh reality, people now take supplemental insurance coverage much more seriously.To be fair, Gurufocus.com labels AFL as significantly overvalued. On a year-to-date basis, AFL jumped nearly 22%. Also, in the trailing month, it’s up almost 9%. Nevertheless, AFL still trades at 9-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings, which sits below the sector median of 12 times. Combined with its fundamental relevance, AFL ranks as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Story continuesProgressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWell known for its quirky commercials featuring the fictional salesperson character Flo, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) represents the third largest insurance carrier and the number one commercial auto insurer in the U.S. Fundamentally, insurance stocks and benchmark rates generally feature a direct correlation: as one rises, so too does the other.Now, certain circumstances such as market volatility and other critical headwinds may disrupt this relationship. Nevertheless, as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates, PGR makes an excellent case for itself because of the underlying business. Simply put, according to Progressive’s website, nearly every state requires car insurance coverage. The lone state that doesn’t – Massachusetts – still requires proof of financial responsibility.In other words, Progressive cynically enjoys a captive audience. Further, with the post-pandemic new normal imposing ramped up dangers on the road, insurance becomes even more critical. Therefore, PGR easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Sempra Energy (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Most folks I talk to love the Golden State, particularly Southern California. With excellent weather year-round and plenty of stuff to do, it’s a dream experience for many. However, great experiences come at a cost. While many residents complain about the metaphorical sunshine tax, it’s actually a real thing. Enter Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE).Representing one of the largest utility holding companies in the U.S., Sempra commands a massive footprint of about 40 million customers. Further, these households tend to generate higher-than-average income compared to the rest of the nation. As well, because California represents a highly desired destination state – conservative talking points be damned – Sempra knows it owns a hostage audience.Because of this permanent demand structure, SRE cynically ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. While I get that people are moving out of California in droves, there are also plenty of higher-income folks moving in. Thus, SRE will continue to enjoy tremendous relevance.Phillips 66 (PSX)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comWith Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), investors will want to exercise caution through careful entry into the market. A multinational energy firm, Phillips 66 mainly specializes in the downstream component of the industry. This deals with segments such as refining and marketing. However, rising borrowing costs tend to be negative for commodities, including energy resources. Therefore, you may want to tiptoe into PSX shares.Indeed, the circumstances become more complicated because of the underlying market performance. Since the start of the year, PSX gained nearly 44% of equity value. Also, in the trialing month, it’s up 4.5%. In other words, interested investors may want to wait a bit until shares cool down before pulling the trigger.Nevertheless, the broader fundamentals should bode well for PSX, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. With possibly 90% of companies requiring a return to the office (at least partially), this circumstance will boost mobility statistics. Of course, mobility on the freeways isn’t free, thus benefitting PSX.AllianceBernstein (AB)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comIn prior InvestorPlace articles, I’ve mentioned the bullish case for AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), typically because outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rates AB shares highly. However, as a candidate among stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m sure many folks remain skeptical. After all, AllianceBernstein represents a global asset management firm. Its job becomes much more difficult during a deflationary cycle.And believe me, should the Fed continue to shrink the money supply via raising borrowing costs, this action is deflationary: fewer dollars chasing after more goods. Under this scenario, several publicly traded securities may stumble because of business erosion.Still, AB could be a surprise idea among stocks to buy for rising interest rates because of societal realities. AllianceBernstein caters to high-net-worth individuals, meaning that the enterprise uses only the best resources. It also only hires the best advisors. Combine the two and you have one of the few asset managers that can guide their clients successfully through this deflationary storm. Just imagine the powerful word of mouth that such a success story can generate.Discover Financial (DFS)Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a ""BUY NOW!"" button on a laptop keyboard.Source: ShutterstockAlthough Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) tends to be overlooked relative to its more popular competitors within the financial services space, DFS is well worth consideration among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. On an elemental and cynical level, Discover pads its bottom line when interest rates rise. Further, as economic pressures build, people tend to resort to credit to make ends meet.Again, it’s a cynical argument and I’m not celebrating this dynamic. Rather, I’m pointing out the harsh truth. For instance, after the level of consumer loans dropped to a multi-year low of $739 billion in April 2021, this metric skyrocketed to $928 billion this month.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, sold US$4.1m worth of shares at a price of US$176 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$186. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 15% of Hugh Johnston's stake.Insiders in PepsiCo didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At PepsiCo Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of PepsiCo shares. In total, insiders dumped US$6.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes PepsiCo Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. PepsiCo insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$391m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PepsiCo Insiders?Insiders haven't bought PepsiCo stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, PepsiCo makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) share price is 106% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 32% in about a quarter.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was able to grow its EPS at 37% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 27% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 15% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Regeneron Pharmaceuticals better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBut note: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may not be the best stock to buy.

109,784daf99-d496-3bdb-b93b-148da5011369,CSCO,2022-12-04,"With 74% ownership of the shares, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-ownership-shares-cisco-systems-110030180.html,1670151630,STORY,['CSCO'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Cisco Systems, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Cisco Systems does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cisco Systems, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cisco Systems. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Cisco Systems, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$56m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Cisco Systems. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
