The Dataset, launched by its risk intelligence business Verisk Maplecroft, has been developed as an end-to-end solution for insurers, corporates, banks, and investors to identify exposures to current and future climate risks across global operations, supply chains and portfolios.', 'Created by an in-house team of climate scientists, and based on the latest climate model projections, the Climate Risk Dataset features newly released Climate Scenarios, which assess how physical risks, such as heat, precipitation, drought, and sea level rise, evolve over time across different emissions pathways. In addition, the Dataset includes global risk indices covering climate-related socio-economic vulnerabilities and an array of transition issues to deliver a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of climate risk the world over.', '“Navigating the direct and indirect impacts of climate change is an imperative for multinational organisations if they are to build resilience to a heating world,” says Verisk Maplecroft’s Director of Climate and Resilience, Dr Richard Hewston. “This is dependent on effectively identifying, managing, and reporting climate risk exposures – a complex task that needs credible data you can trust.”', 'The Climate Risk Dataset covers 32 hazards and issues globally. Its Climate Scenarios encompass 16 physical climate risks across seven time periods and three emissions pathways. This amounts to over 330 global climate hazard risk indices with subnational granularity to assist with the identification of risks to assets and specific locations. The Dataset also includes subnational socio-economic indices measuring the adaptive capacity of nations, the sensitivity of societies to climate change, and overall climate vulnerability, alongside national-level transition indices quantifying risks associated with emissions, climate litigation, carbon policies, and environmental regulations.', 'The depth and breadth of the data will help companies:', 'Perform global risk assessments across operations, supply chains and portfolios', 'Align with climate reporting standards, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)', 'Stress test resilience, insurance and investment strategies', 'Identify commercial opportunities in new and existing markets', 'Isolate areas of low resilience and develop effective mitigation measures', 'Understand legal and regulatory challenges stemming from the energy transition', 'Assess the socio-economic impacts of climate change worldwide', 'While many companies are beginning to create mitigation plans for physical threats, ‘cascading’ climate risks are largely going under the radar. With data covering over 170 environmental, political risk, and human rights issues, Verisk Maplecroft’s research into the interconnected nature of risk can also enable companies to identify where secondary climate impacts, such as food insecurity, migration, economic stability, and civil unrest, will emerge.', '“From exposure to climate hazards and their ‘cascading’ impacts, to responses to the energy transition and rising regulatory obligations, companies need to demonstrate, convey, and instill confidence in their current and future performance,” adds Hewston. “The Climate Risk Dataset has been developed to help them do just that.”', 'About Verisk\xa0 Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) is a leading strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry.

Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 7.21%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SWSSX's standard deviation over the past three years is 22.45% compared to the category average of 21.21%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 24.41% compared to the category average of 23.97%.

With a negative alpha of -7.09, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Holdings', 'Exploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise.

Going by our model, the company’s third-quarter cost of sales will likely total $4.8 billion, up 6.7% from the year-ago period.

Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 16%. Despite the moderate return on equity, Acuity Brands has posted a net income growth of 3.1% over the past five years.

The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AYI is currently mispriced by the market.', ""Acuity Brands' low three-year median payout ratio of 5.3% (or a retention ratio of 95%) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth. This should be reflected in its earnings growth number, but that's not the case. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""Additionally, Acuity Brands has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.5% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Acuity Brands has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."", 'The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $10.63 billion, down 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Thermo Fisher?', ""For Thermo Fisher, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Thermo Fisher will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Thermo Fisher would post earnings of $5.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.15, delivering a surprise of -5.16%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Thermo Fisher doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Thermo Fisher Scientific, it has a TSR of 120% for the last 5 years.

Stronger net interest income (NII), the difference between what banks earn from lending and pay out on deposits, boosted profits at US Bancorp and M&T Bank Corp, allowing both lenders to beat Wall Street analyst estimates despite increasing provisions for potential loan losses. A small-than-expected 16% drop in US Bancorp's profit was cushioned by a nearly 11% growth in its NII to $4.2 billion, Credit loss provisions, however, jumped 42% to $515 million.

The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18,203 million. The upside was driven by a 2.9% rise in identical sales, with retail price inflation, growth in pharmacy and increasing digital penetration contributing to the metric. Top-line growth was partly offset by lower fuel sales. Impressively, digital sales rose 19% year over year in the quarter.The gross profit amounted to $5,041.5 million, up 0.7% year over year. However, the gross margin contracted 30 basis points to 27.6%. We expected a year-over-year decline of 10 basis points in the gross margin for the quarter under review.Excluding the impacts of fuel and LIFO expenses, the gross margin rate decreased 37 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

Meanwhile, the adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points to 5.3% on a year-over-year basis. The decline in adjusted EBITDA can be attributed to the company’s fuel business and fewer COVID-19 vaccinations in the quarter.

We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 324%. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 22% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets."", ""In a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Microchip Technology has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. Since the stock has returned a staggering 154% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes.

In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.46%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Flowserve would post earnings of $0.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of +30%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

They dropped the FIFA name, which is because they just couldn't come to an agreement with FIFA, the organization. And so they're essentially moving forward with this same game under the FC title."", ""We also have Nintendo. They're launching a new Mario game at the end of this week, Super Mario Wonder. That should help goose some of the Switch sales going into the holiday season. Perhaps we'll see some bundles with that."", ""Sony is launching Marvel's Spider-Man 2. That's going to be massive for them. That's a game that's a follow on to, you guessed it, Marvel Spider-Man. And you'll be able to play as the two Spider-Men, Peter Parker and Miles Morales, and there may be some Venom action in there as well."", ""And then we also have the new game from Sega Like A Dragon Gaiden-- The Man Who Erased His Name. I just put this in because I'm really excited for it. It's formerly the Yakuza series. My wife has played a ton of them.

Additionally, starting in 2022 and on a comparative basis, for these measures other than net revenues and operating cash flow, PMI includes adjustments to add back amortization expense on acquisition related intangible assets that are recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to PMI’s revenue generation, as well as impairment of intangible assets, if any. While amortization expense on acquisition related intangible assets is excluded in these adjusted measures, the net revenues generated from these acquired intangible assets are included in the company\'s adjusted measures, unless otherwise stated. Currency-neutral and organic growth rates reflect the way management views underlying performance for these measures. PMI believes that such measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This hospital and health facility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.3%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $3.54 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Universal Health Services?', ""For Universal Health Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.73%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Universal Health Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Universal Health Services would post earnings of $2.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.53, delivering a surprise of +2.02%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Universal Health Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', ""Among the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, HCA Healthcare (HCA) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.99 per share for the quarter ended September 2023.

These matters within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PPG’s operations, as discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in Europe, the amount of future share repurchases, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, PPG inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of potential future and completed acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.', 'All information in this release speaks only as of October 18, 2023, and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information.

VTR owns a well-diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets. In the wake of the pandemic, the company’s senior housing operations portfolio (SHOP) has been benefiting from the healthy operating trends of the senior housing industry. Also, the positive outpatient visit trend and the increasing need for biopharma drug development opportunities have bolstered its outpatient medical and research portfolio’s growth. However, dependence on a few tenants and a high interest rate environment make us apprehensive.', ""The senior citizens’ population is expected to rise in the years ahead. As a result, the national healthcare expenditure by senior citizens, who constitute a major customer base of healthcare services and incur higher healthcare expenditures than the average population, will likely increase in the upcoming period. Ventas’ SHOP segment is expected to capitalize on this positive expenditure trend, boosting the segment’s growth.Moreover, the segment is witnessing favorable demand-supply fundamentals, which is likely to drive its growth over the next three to five years. Improving revenue and expense trends during the second quarter of 2023 led to a year-over-year margin expansion of 160 basis points.Therefore, given the favorable demographic trend for the senior housing industry and muted new supply in its markets, Ventas’ SHOP segment is well-prepared for a compelling multiyear growth opportunity. For 2023, our estimate indicates a year-over-year rise of 12.3% in the SHOP segment's net operating income (NOI) in 2023.Ventas’ outpatient medical and research portfolio, which includes outpatient medical buildings and research centers, is likely to gain from the rising outpatient visit trends of people aged 65 years and above. Given this age cohort's expected population increase in the upcoming period, the company’s outpatient medical segment’s performance is likely to flourish.Also, to further enhance its research portfolio, which is essential for delivering crucial healthcare services and research related to life-saving vaccines and therapeutics, the healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) is carrying out accretive investments. Such efforts augur well for the segment’s performance. We estimate a year-over-year increase of 5% and 5.7% in the company’s outpatient medical and research segment’s NOI in 2023 and 2024, respectively.Ventas maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample financial flexibility. It had more than $2.7 billion of liquidity and a net debt to further adjusted EBITDA of 7.0X as of Jun 30, 2023. In addition, credit ratings of BBB+ from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch, and Baa1 from Moody’s render the company easy access to the debt market at favorable costs. Hence, a robust financial footing is likely to continue supporting the company’s efforts to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities."", 'Competition from national and local healthcare operators may weigh on Ventas. The company’s operators contend with peers for occupancy, which could limit the company’s power to raise rents and affect revenues and profitability.Ventas’ triple-net-leased property segment is exposed to tenant concentration risk, with properties leased to Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred accounting for a significant portion of total net operating income in the three months ended Jun 30, 2023. Hence, in case of no lease renewal, a change in lease agreements or any adverse development concerning these three tenants could lead to a deterioration in the company’s financial condition and results.Further, given the prevailing high interest rate environment, this healthcare REIT may find it challenging to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. For 2023, management expects higher interest rates to impact its normalized funds from operations (FFO) by 16 cents per share.

Our results for the third quarter reflect solid execution against the challenging phase of this interest rate cycle, particularly as rates appear close to be peaking. Third quarter deposit levels were generally in line with seasonal expectations, but funding costs were significantly higher, putting pressure on net interest income. We're focusing primarily on those areas of the business that are most under our control. Namely trust fees and expenses.In those 2 areas, we're pleased with our performance. Trust fee revenue was up both sequentially and year-over-year. Expenses were well controlled, and we improved our capital position. Our Wealth Management business grew trust fees on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. We saw ongoing strength in the higher wealth tiers and within our Global Family Office segment, where momentum outside the U.S. continues to be brisk. Families with large and complex truck structures continue to be an area where we excel.Activity with business owners also remains robust, helping them optimize their complex personal affairs while they attend to growing their businesses is a consistent theme. We're also seeing early success with various new marketing approaches and referral sources. In particular, during the third quarter, we had healthy new business generation with clients with assets over $50 million.In Asset Management, we saw positive flows into our institutional money market platform for the third consecutive quarter. Relative to benchmarks, our tax-advantaged equity product performance remained strong within the quarter cementing its 1, 3 and 5-year track record of out-performance. Importantly, 2 recent large asset servicing wins contain asset management mandates for index fixed income and outsourced investment solutions. Reinforcing our combined strength as One Northern. Within Asset Servicing, we had good momentum in core custody and fund administration and our pipeline remains solidly within historical levels. Our front office solutions is resonating particularly well across regions and different client types. One notable front office solutions win in the third quarter was the $32 billion Abu Dhabi Pension Fund.Our ability to provide a comprehensive view across public and private assets was cited as a key differentiator. Importantly, we were also selected to provide global custody, liquidity management, performance in risk analytics and portfolio optimization. We also had good success in the U.S. asset owner space where we continue to take share. In closing, we entered the fourth quarter on solid footing. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample capital and liquidity, and our credit quality remains excellent. New business momentum is healthy and our pipeline is robust. Expense growth has declined each quarter this year, and I'm confident that we'll continue to build on this discipline. We're well positioned to navigate the current uncertain environment including the proposed regulatory changes related to capital and long-term debt and generate value for our stakeholders.I'll now turn the call over to Jason."", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Thank you, Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $328 million. Earnings per share of $1.49, and our return on average common equity was 11.6%. Our assets under custody/administration and assets under management were down modestly on a sequential basis but up sharply on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable markets and currency movements more than offset positive asset inflows relative to the prior period. Year-over-year levels benefited from favorable markets, currency improvements and asset inflows. On a year-over-year basis, currency movements had an approximate 90 basis point favorable impact on revenue growth, largely within our Asset Services division and a 100 basis point unfavorable impact on expenses. On a sequential basis, currency impacts were immaterial.Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was down 2% on both the sequential quarter and year-over-year basis. Expenses were up 1% sequentially and up 5% over the prior year. This reflects an expense to trust fee ratio of 115%. Down from 116% in the second quarter but higher than the 112% we posted in the third quarter of last year. Pre-tax income was up 1% sequentially, but down 20% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion, a 1% sequential increase and a 3% increase compared to last year.All other noninterest income was up 6% sequentially, but down 3% over the prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $469 million. Down 10% sequentially and down 11% from a year ago. Our provision for credit losses was $14 million in the third quarter.Overall, our credit quality remains very strong. We had small net recoveries for the quarter, and there was a modest increase in nonperforming loans. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $13.2 trillion at quarter end, down 2% sequentially but up 10% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees totaled $626 million. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of fees in the business were $428 million. Sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business activity, offset by weaker transaction volume.The year-over-year strength was due to solid new business activity and favorable market and currency impacts. That were partially offset by lower transaction volume. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $963 billion, down 3% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Similarly, because a significant portion of our fees are billed on a lagged basis, the sequential decline in AUM will impact our fourth quarter trust fees. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $137 million.Moving to our Wealth Management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients was $370 billion. Trust administration and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $486 million. Our average balance sheet decreased 4% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower client deposits. Client liquidity was essentially flat during third quarter. Average deposits were $102 billion, down $4 billion or 4% sequentially, in line with our expectations for this seasonably weaker quarter. The decline was seen largely in the interest-bearing channel as clients continue to reallocate cash position.Noninterest-bearing deposits remained stable, down less than $1 billion sequentially, and the mix held steady at 17%. At quarter end, operational deposits remained at approximately 2/3 of institutional deposits and institutional deposits comprised 75% to 80% of the total mix. Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet. The duration of the securities portfolio reduced slightly to 1.9 years. The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year. Loan balances averaged $42 billion and were flat sequentially. Our loan portfolio is well diversified across geographies, operating segments and loan types.Approximately 70% of the loan portfolio is floating and the overall duration is below 1 year. Our liquidity remains strong. Cash held at the Fed and other central banks was down reflecting the absorption of the deposit decreases, but highly liquid assets comprise more than 55% of our deposits and nearly 50% of total earning assets. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $469 million for the quarter, down 10% sequentially and down 11% from the prior year. NII reflected the impact of several dynamics. We saw some continued client migration into higher-yielding cash alternatives, but the pace moderated as we expected. Deposit cost increases were a slightly bigger factor with funding costs up 46 basis points over the second quarter.Due to the competitive environment, we repriced a small number of meaningful products to ensure we're protecting deposit volumes. We're not price leaders, but we're vigorously defending our deposits with an eye toward playing the long game. We expect to benefit from this strategy when rates decline. Client engagement also led to a combination of specific repricing on existing accounts and a shift to higher paying term deposits. There's no question that clients want to remain on our balance sheet. But sensing that the rate cycle is close to peaking. They've begun to stretch for duration. Our NII in the fourth quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior, which has been less predictable given the speed and extent of this cycle's rate hikes. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are $100 billion. Modest outflows are expected to continue, due in part to client efforts to optimize returns and to some known outflows related to M&A activity and other corporate needs.Pricing should remain under pressure with further NIM compression possible. We currently expect fourth quarter NII to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million. Factors that could swing the outcome include the pace of further deposit outflows, the level of price pressure, the extent to which we see -- we continue to see deposit mix shift and the offsetting impact from the repricing of the securities portfolio.As we look out to 2024, there are a wide range of scenarios under which net interest income could trend. Deposit pricing pressure, our securities maturity schedule, investment outlook and other factors provide upside that's not reflected in the current quarter.Turning to Page 8. As reported, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, down 4% sequentially but up 4% as compared to the prior year. Excluding unusual items in both periods, including those noted on the slide, expenses in the third quarter were up 1% sequentially and up over 5% year-over-year. I'll hit on just a few highlights. Excluding unusual items, compensation expense was down 2% sequentially. This reflected reductions in incentive compensation and head count actions taken year-to-date. The increase over the last year reflects 2023 base pay adjustments.Excluding unusual items in all periods, non-compensation expense was up 3% sequentially. Our expense-to-trust fee ratio improved 100 basis points sequentially to 115%, but remains higher than our targeted range of 105% to 110%.As a reminder, we began the year expecting to take at least 200 basis points off of our 2022 adjusted expense growth rate of 9%. Our first quarter adjusted results were meaningfully better, up 5.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted results were even better up 5.3% year-over-year. And our third quarter results were in the same range despite unfavorable currency impacts. For the fourth quarter, we expect continued improvement. Compensation expense is expected to be up $5 million. Benefits expense should be our normal fourth quarter lift of $3 million to $5 million. Outside services likely to be up approximately $10 million. Equipment and software should be up approximately $10 million relative to adjusted third quarter levels. And occupancy is expected to increase a few million dollars above adjusted third quarter levels.Other operating expense has many components, including market-driven categories that are not predictable, but it has tended to increase in the fourth quarter. All in, this would put our full year adjusted expense growth rate at approximately 5% or roughly 400 basis points lower than 2022 levels. Our financial model is based upon mid-single-digit trustee growth from a combination of organic growth and market appreciation. Against this backdrop, we hope to generate 100 to 200 basis points in trust fee operating leverage in normal macro environments.Our capital levels and ratios remained strong in the quarter. We continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimum. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach was up slightly from the prior quarter to 11.4% as capital accretion more than offset the unfavorable impact from higher rates on our securities portfolio. This reflects a 440 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.9%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter end, our AOCI was a negative $1.4 billion, a slight improvement over second quarter levels. We returned $159 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158 million. And common stock repurchases of $1 million.We slowed our buyback activity in order to reserve for the anticipated FDIC special assessment. We're well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements, that Mike referenced without significant changes to our operating model. And with that, Melissa, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)And we can go with our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.', 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""That was like the price is right. I like it. Okay. So I appreciate the range of outcomes for NII next year that you can control. So I'll leave that aside for a second. But you mentioned your expense-to-trust fee ratio, your target and what you can do in terms of operating leverage in a better environment or normal environment. I'm curious just what's the overall approach towards expenses as you enter budget season next year within that mindset of what your goals are? And how do you approach it with that much uncertainty around things that you can't control?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. Well, as we enter, this is the time of year where we're thinking -- trying to get a sense of where the launch points will be. And I walked through a little bit of a financial model for you guys to think about. That if we're -- over time, we'll get lift from the equity markets and we should also have low to mid-single-digit organic growth. If we can get 100 to 200 basis points in fee operating leverage, that sets us up really well based on where our pretax margin is for good EPS growth over time. And so that's the goal that we -- it's one of the metrics that we look at really closely. And we're still in an inflationary environment where it's harder to get that operating leverage if you're just looking at fees because the expenses are elevated and you don't get the benefit from higher rates on the trust fee line.But you can tell that we've spent an incredible amount of effort this year working the year-over-year expense growth rates down. And you go back to 2022 and printing a 9% growth. Coming into this year, we knew we had to do better than that, and we've been grinding that down each quarter, quarter after quarter. We first tackled it with working hard on labor, and you can see that's the biggest cost that we have. So we have to get that right. Headcount is down, and then another key element is technology. That shows up in equipment, software and outside services. That's still elevated above the rest of the company in terms of growth rate, but we've had a lot of accomplishments there, too and expecting to have that growth rate be lower next year than it has historically.And so we think we can have another year next year that's similar to what we did in this year, which is to work that -- could continue to work that year-over-year growth rate down."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""Exactly what I look for, you have tons of capital and you generate plenty also. But I'm curious, some of the big banks have articulated what they thought as is the RWA impact or all-in impact might be. I'm curious at your first glance -- what type of impact are we talking? I know that you mentioned it doesn't disrupt your model, and I agree. I'm just curious if you can help us box it in, in terms of (inaudible) impacts, if as is?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Sure. Yes, I'm going to give you a wide range of like 5% to 15% in RWA, and that will -- that's going to be impacted by a few different things. But one of the benefits that we have is the diversification of the business model. And so we've got -- obviously, the custody business comes with a lot of operational risk. That's really the most significant driver but we'll actually get some benefit from an RWA perspective in some of the loan treatments. Just given the nature of our underlying loans. And then there are some other dynamics that we have that should help on RWA as well on a relative basis.But it's -- we're thinking about it at this point, it could be anywhere from 5% to 15%. As we mentioned earlier, we feel really comfortable, and we see where our CET1 levels are and see where our liquidity is. And so we'll keep an eye on where our peers are. We'll keep an eye on what the business is doing, but we've got flexibility in other ways to manage that dynamic as well."", 'Operator', 'We can take our next question from Michael Brown with KBW.', 'Michael C. Brown', 'Good morning, everyone. So I guess I wanted to start on the custody and fund admin fees. They were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, I guess, a little bit softer than we expected. What are some of the key drivers that played out this quarter. And as you noted, the lower market levels present a bit of a headwind here for the fourth quarter, but you did talk about some positive dynamics on the new business front. So what are the puts and takes that we should think about over the fourth quarter and then heading into next year?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Sure. So first of all, the -- if you just look at the custody and fund admin line, and split it we talked about the fact that currency on a sequential basis was effectively a push year-over-year. It helped more than that roughly in the neighborhood of 1.5% to 2%. But if we just go back and look sequentially at how the quarter looked, the net new business was in custody and fund admin fees was a positive. It was low single digits, very low single digits, but positive. And then transaction volumes continue to be light. And we're starting to talk about that dynamic as something that might be more long term, just as our clients move more toward more indexing as opposed to active management.There's less trading activity, there's less reporting. There's less transitions. And so we did -- we're continuing to see a lower level of transaction-related activity. But the overall business is strong, again, net positive from an overall net new business perspective. And the pipeline, as Mike mentioned, looks strong."", 'Michael C. Brown', ""Okay. And then if we just change gears to the deposit side, it sounds like the pressure there still remains. Could you just maybe unpack some of those underlying dynamics by client type and maybe just touch on where the pressure is perhaps the greatest and maybe where there's a bit less of a challenge. And are you seeing some elements of the deposit base that are seeing stabilization here? Or is it really kind of across the board?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Definitely feel it's stabilized in a lot of ways. It's hard to predict where it's going to go because obviously, it's been a volatile cycle and clients are clearly trying to figure out what to do from here. There's a lot of clients that are terming out their deposits. We saw in the wealth side, just to get at your question of how it's separated by channel, the wealth side, we saw a significant increase in term deposits. So clients are saying this is an opportunity to move out of checking and into CDs.And a part of that is the nature of our clients where they have large amounts of deposits. And so they can take a component of their deposits and think about that more strategically and less about the need to maintain that liquidity just for day-to-day payments, and then in the institute but interestingly, on the wealth side, deposits are actually up if you think -- if you look [$630 to $930] they're up somewhat. And so it gives us an indication that the pricing actions we took were worked really well. Clients are -- they continue to see the strength of the balance sheet. They like to deposit on Northern Trust's balance sheet. So that increase was meaningful.On -- in the institutional side, that's what drove the period-to-period and most of the average decline -- and that comes to a lot of clients is moving to different types of either longer duration or higher-yielding liquidity types. Overall, liquidity across the company was flat. Across the channels cumulatively. And so clients clearly are just saying Northern is the right place to be. They're moving from one overall liquidity mechanism to another. And as we look out, I think it's interesting to see that the balance is thus far in the quarter have held in just over $100 billion. And frankly, that's higher, and it's still early in the quarter, but that's higher than what we would have anticipated at this point.And the $430 million to $440 million, just to give some context there that assumes that net interest margin would be relatively flat, up a couple to a few basis points, but deposits would have to come down an average in the $93 billion to $95 billion for us to get down to that $430 million to $440 million. And so at this point, thus far, again, it's varied -- we're 2 weeks into a 13-week quarter, the deposit levels are holding in higher than that."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.', 'Alexander Blostein', ""So just another one around deposits you guys seem to have been a bit surprised, I guess, by this latest move in terms of kind of the catch up that you played there you articulated at the conference in September and obviously today. Do you feel like you caught up to where institutional pricing is? Or do you still think there might be incremental migration or kind of the need to increase price more?And then again, on the institutional side of things, is there a particular client base or channel internationally that's driving this pickup? Or is that fairly broad-based? Because your competitor set there is fairly limited, right? I mean we know there is 3 or 4. And at the end of the day, that's where you compete with on the custody side. So I'm just kind of curious where we are in that process?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""It seems like we caught up. And we made -- if we get to what we thought we were going to be down about 5% in NII. We ended up down 10%. We saw that mid-quarter and hit right on the number what happened in the -- call it, the August time frame, we clearly saw that in general, the market was taking deposit pricing up, and we reacted to that. We're not again, we're not price makers. We're price takers. And so we reacted to that and it seems to very much have leveled out the deposit activity. And that's why you see things very kind of flattish.And then also into this quarter, stabilizing at levels we thought would be even higher. And so I think the big takeaway is it seems like the pricing is where it needs to be for clients to level things out. And the pricing actions that we took were in pretty small number but of big accounts. And you asked about geography, the bigger actions we took were in the U.S. custody book on the institutional side of the business and then in wealth, it was in MMDA. And so we took a targeted approach to increase those pricings in early, early reactions look like we got it, we hit the mark well."", 'Alexander Blostein', ""Got it. All right. Shifting gears a little bit, pretty constructive comments from you guys on the new business. We've heard that for the last couple of quarters. As you know, converting net to fees is always a little hard, and it's a bit opaque. So -- any way you can frame maybe the fee backlog and as we sort of work that through into revenues over the next, call it, 12 months, do you feel like you have enough scale in the business to onboard, especially some of these larger mandates without a material pickup in expenses. So in other words, to Glenn's point, it sounds like you guys are aiming for, I don't know, 3% to 4% expense growth in '24. Is that doable with potentially more net new business?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""It is. And we didn't give a number on the expense growth, just that we want to do better than what we did this year. And so with that backdrop, the growth in the asset servicing business, in particular, it's come with expenses. It's a less scalable business relative to wealth, which is obviously highly, highly scalable. That said, we were focused, as you can tell from what we've done this year, not just on top line growth but on managing the type of business that comes in. And so that's why head count was such an incredible focus for us this year, the compensation line, an incredible focus, and so as we look at what business to bring on board, there's going to be a very strong scrutiny on looking at what expenses come along with it.The business is committed to do that. They're -- it's they're leading that effort saying that they're going to be very diligent about identifying what business to bring on."", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Yes. And Alex, I would just add to what Jason is saying there is that's why we're driving so hard on productivity as well is because we have to have the capacity to invest in the foundation of the business and what we're building out, the investments we need to make. But then also, to your point, if you're going to bring on new business that has resources, you have to be able to offset a portion of that as well."", 'Alexander Blostein', ""Got it. Okay. That all makes sense. And sorry, I didn't mean to put words in your mouth on the 3% to 4%. It just sounds like less than 5%. So maybe you're still thinking. Okay."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.', 'Brennan Hawken', ""I would love to unpack a little bit because -- you walked through some of the -- it sounds like you walked through some of the underlying assumptions behind the $430 million to $440 million expectation for 4Q. It sounded like you were saying that it predicated a deposit base of 93% to 95% and NIM flat. Did I interpret that correctly? And does that suggest that you're sort of girding for further deposit declines even though they've been stable quarter-to-date?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Just to tweak the words. I mentioned that implies NIM would be up a few basis points, but the deposit levels you mentioned, are accurate. And so coming last quarter, we came into it thinking we were going to be down 5%, the market ended up being more competitive. And again, we've got to react to what the market is doing. We don't set it. And so coming into this quarter, we just -- we did prepare for a further decline in deposits, and that could easily still happen.So not walking that back, which is saying that early stages of the quarter are indicating the deposit levels are higher than that. And we've also got -- even as we look out to next year, we don't think about this $430 million to $440 million as the run rate of NII and there's reasons for us to believe that NII is going to go up from there. And just if you look at the runoff in the securities portfolio, and we're still trading securities that are yielding to and reinvesting at [5%] and security is yielding in the 2s and reinvesting it above that. And so without taking more risk or duration. And so there are things that we can continue to do. We've also had the balance sheet positioned very defensively.We saw the decline in deposits that was happening and frankly, the stress in the banking industry in the spring and in the summer, and we positioned very defensively. We wanted to -- we have the ability to do that based on the strength of the balance sheet. We can stay short, we cannot stretch for NII. But as we feel more confident about the stability of deposits, the stability of the industry, we can use non-HQLA capacity. And so there's multiple levers we have to work on NII.So although we're trying to give you as much color as we can about fourth quarter, the interpretation shouldn't be that that's necessarily something that you should annualize thinking about 2024."", 'Brennan Hawken', ""Okay. All that's fair. I guess the 2024 will depend on the competition for deposits. So we'll see how that goes. One follow-up here. You guys made reference -- and I apologize if you said it in the prepared remarks, there a couple of overlapping calls here this morning. You laid out a Visa gain in the press release, but I didn't hear it quantified in the commentary. Is it possible to quantify that impact?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. It's up $10 million to $15 million relative to second quarter. Second quarter was a slight loss. This was a slight gain. And that -- just a little bit of color the -- that relates to a derivative that we have associated with part of our Visa position. And as the -- our view of the length of that swap, extends or reduces that has an impact to the mark-to-market. And as there was news that was proposed by -- well, a news it was put out this quarter of Visa saying that they have a shareholder proposal to release half the shares. It reduces the amount of time in that swap. And so therefore, it changed the mark from what it normally -- what it otherwise would be."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ryan Michael Kenny', ""So just in thinking through the puts and takes to NII, you mentioned taking securities yielding to and reinvesting at [5%] here's update us on how much AFS and HTM roll-off you're expecting per quarter going forward. And as those securities mature, are you mostly reinvesting that into cash?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""I want to make sure I got the question fully. Can you repeat it for me? You just can't throw a little soft. I want to make sure I got it."", 'Ryan Michael Kenny', ""Yes. So as you as you're reinvesting securities from [2% into 5%], you let us know just how much AFS and HTM roll off you're expecting per quarter? And are you reinvesting that all into cash?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Sure. A lot of the reinvestment recently has been in cash. And -- but again, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, that's not necessarily where we'll be reinvesting it before. And as we look at the schedule, it probably averages the runoff averages about 2%, particularly let's just take the U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. And then overall, there's about close to a little over $1 billion a quarter across all the currencies that's maturing, that's reinvesting."", 'Operator', 'And moving on to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', 'Just one clarification on the other investment in -- or the other income that was $68 million this quarter versus $55 million in the second quarter. Should we take that $55 million and think of that as a more normalized run rate given the noise on the Visa swap gain?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes, I think Visa is going to -- at some point in time, I think the noise in that line item will just go away. And there's Visa did announce that they didn't make this announcement. And so that should have an impact on the swap at some point. And so I think it shouldn't be -- again, it has tended to be a negative, that negative will go away. And so the prior run rates are probably too low and the current run rate might be too high. The best way to think about it."", 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""Okay. Okay. Fair enough on that. And then just on the NII guide, just to clarify also the $430 million to $440 million. Is that FTE? And then -- well, let me just ask that first. That's FTE, correct?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', 'Yes.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""Okay. Okay. Great. And then just as we move into '24, some of the elements, obviously, a lot of wide ranges of what can potentially happen. But on the competition front, it sounded like that was fairly episodic this third quarter, it got resolved. And just sort of, I guess, your view on whether you think that might reemerge, of course, it's always tough to predict. But just in terms of the fact that you're able to defend it, with higher rates but keep those deposits, would that seemingly be a disincentive for other providers to try to grab those deposits and not actually get them. And then what would you think of -- maybe this is tough to answer to you, but what level of deposits is at risk of that competition within the custody and the wealth business?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""In the institutional business, let's start there. The -- a lot of those deposits are there for clients to be processing payments. And they not only have the end-of-day deposit needs, but intra-day needs as they have they can have intraday overdrafts. And so they've got to think about their liquidity, not just end of the day, but intraday. And we process a tremendous amount of payments across the system. And so that's why we always are talking about not just the traditional operational component, but the amount of dollars and velocity that we have in the asset servicing business, which is very high. The amounts that are more sensitive to rates tend to be very large clients that are making a decision on where to park large amounts of dollars and those tend to be negotiated.And that's kind of the top end, but that's also where there's lighter spread. In the wealth side of the business, clients are making decisions more from a product perspective, and they're moving between term treasuries, money market funds and traditional checking accounts. And we've seen increases in all non-checking account areas over this cycle. And we've seen CDs go from less than $1 billion to close to $4 billion. And that obviously has a really big impact when you think that, that's coming from a traditional checking account. Into a market rate CD there's hundreds of basis points of difference. And so if it gives you a little bit of a sense of -- on the wealth side, we've talked about 75% of the deposits overall that we have are in wealth. And -- I'm sorry, (inaudible) institutional and 25% in wealth. And so -- and then you see the type of movement that can happen if we're talking about $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion of movement of that $20 billion to $30 billion base, it's pretty meaningful.And but it's -- the good news, it has stayed with us, and we've done a good job of holding on to the deposits. Again, it's been deposits up this past quarter and overall client liquidity for the business flat from one quarter to another."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.', 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""Yes, I'm a little confused on the NII guidance. So you're looking to be down 6% to 8% in the fourth quarter to $430 million to $440 million -- and -- but you said don't take that as a run rate. And so what kind of run rate do you think you'll have? Because I guess you're guiding down NII 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So how much of that do you think you get back as you take those 2% securities and invest them in 5% and take all your other actions?And do you think the fourth quarter will be the low point or the NII inflection comes later? Or just A little bit more color on that, if you could?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Sure. Now, fourth quarter could be -- it could definitely be a low point and particularly thinking about some of the things that we mentioned, but just taking the securities runoff alone, the math gets to -- you get to over, call it, $10 million, $12 million, $13 million lift per quarter. Calling just from securities from just the securities maturing and reinvesting again in similar duration, similar credit profile and that's without us taking these other actions. And just as our clients are thinking about where are we in the yield in the overall rate cycle, we think about that as well.And we've -- again, we position we've had the balance sheet positioned in a pretty defensive manner. And this provides us an opportunity to start thinking about what do we do differently. But just the maturity schedule alone has kind of a, call it, a $50 million annualized lift to it. And that's just one of the levers that we have that we'll be working from."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""In light of just more headwinds, though, than you had expected? I know you said no more expense plans, but -- and you have kind of bent the cost curve, which is the expression, I guess, of the year. Any thoughts up tightening up expenses even more than you've already done?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. The productivity office, we launched just in this year from kind of a standing start, and we're going to get over $100 million within this $100 million of savings in this year, most of those are on a recurring basis. And so you see a lot of that reflected in the actions we took from a compensation perspective, but negotiations with consulting firms, how we're looking at demand for technology consumption, how we're managing real estate, and so we've pulled a lot of levers there and it couldn't have a higher sense of urgency on what we're thinking about from a productivity perspective but we should be getting above 2% a year in help from productivity. And we're not going to stop uncovering opportunities and having difficult conversations about what we can stop doing or how we can be thinking about things differently."", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Might definitely continued focus on productivity, as Jason is saying. So I just want to emphasize that point. There are still plenty of opportunities to functionalize, automate, centralize a number of different, I'll call it, more fundamental structural things that we're doing already, but just have longer time frames to implement them. in order to get those savings longer term and a lot around technology that enables that. So it absolutely has been a focus, but will continue to be a focus. Particularly as the environment is so uncertain and not necessarily knowing what the direction of whether it's rates or markets are going to be."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Can you guys -- can we take a step back, we're obviously on the weeds in the quarter-to-quarter stuff for all of the banks, understandably so. But when you step back if we're now after -- since the financial crisis, let's call it, 14 years of incredibly low interest rate environment with a little blip up in 2018, of course. But if we're now in a new environment for the next 3 to 5 years where the short end of the curve stays above 3% or 4%, maybe even 5% for nobody knows for sure. How does that maybe alter the way you guys have been running the business for the last 10 years in a 0% rate environment, to one now that is going to be 300 to 400 basis points higher at the front end of the curve? Or does it alter the way you run the business?"", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Gerard, it's Mike. I appreciate the question. And the answer is yes. It does alter the way that we have to look at the business. And just starting with some of your comments there just around low interest rate environment, higher interest rate environment, what aspects of that are cyclical versus maybe permanent changes. Jason mentioned some of the shifts in the way institutional investors invest and the implications on transaction volumes that may come with that. And as a result, beyond looking at the productivity of the business, which I think we've emphasized here, we also have to look at the pricing side of the business to ensure that we are being appropriately compensated for all the high value-added services that we're providing, I'll take it to all our clients because it really isn't specific to just institutional clients or wealth clients.But if there was an expectation that you were managing a certain level of deposits as a part of an overall relationship, that was a part of the value you were receiving for all the services you're providing. If that's going to be different for some time period, then you have to be compensated in different ways. Now you know our model well enough to know it's not a consumer product or something where you change the pricing daily or even monthly. So it's something that you have to work through the longer-term way that your services are priced and that's the way relationships work. I mean we're always looking to retain relationships, but also very focused on expanding them. And the more we can do with the clients, the better the overall economics.So my point, which I think you're on to it is we do and have been looking at this holistically, both on the revenue side and on the expense side so that we can continue to look at meeting the financial targets that we have."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Very good -- and then as a follow-up, Jason, talking about, obviously, you're approaching your budgeting season, and I'm not asking you to obviously tell us what's going on yet. But can you frame out for us a year ago this time, when you were doing the budgeting for 2023 and you've -- as you pointed out, you guys have made progress in reducing the expense rate of growth. But can you frame out for us the outside factors that you were dealing with last year at this time, whether it's wage inflation or just inflation in general versus today, is it a little easier today or not just as tough the outside factors haven't really changed, and it's going to be a tough environment to put together a budget?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Last year, we were in a heavy, heavy inflationary environment that was hitting us in not just our labor costs, but also we were defending from others trying to take our talent a lot was one of the talking points that we had at the time. That had implications and we were just spending time on that as well. And then we were seeing inflation come in technology costs in a lot of different ways. So every budget year is really, really difficult. I have to say that the macro headwinds last year, I feel we're heavier than they are this year."", 'Operator', 'It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Childe at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.', 'Jennifer Childe', ""Thanks, Melissa. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Peters; Co-CEO, President & Director; Netflix, Inc.', 'Spencer Wang; VP of Finance, Corporate Development & IR; Netflix, Inc.', 'Spencer Adam Neumann; CFO; Netflix, Inc.', 'Theodore A. Sarandos; Co-CEO, President & Director; Netflix, Inc.', 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen; MD in Equity Research; BofA Securities, Research Division', 'Spencer Wang', ""Good afternoon, and welcome to Netflix Q3 2023 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEOs, Ted Sarandos; and Greg Peters; and CFO, Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. Jessica, let me turn it over to you now for your first question."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""Thank you. So let's start with the you, Ted. Now that 1 strike is over, the writers guild, what are the implications for your business?"", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""Thanks, Jessica. Let me first say, we want nothing more than to resolve this and get everyone back to work. That's true for Netflix. That's true for every member of the AMPTP. It's why our member CEOs have prioritized these negotiations above everything else we're doing. We spent hours and hours with SAG-AFTRA over the last few weeks, and we were actually very optimistic that we are making progress. But at the very end of our last session together, the guild presented this new demand that, kind of on top of everything, for a per subscriber levy unrelated to viewing or success, and this really broke our momentum, unfortunately. But you should know, we are incredibly and totally committed to ending this strike. The industry, our communities and the economy are all hurting. So we need to get a deal done that respects all sides as soon as we possibly can. In terms of the impact, these are the times that I'm glad we have such a rich and deep and broad programming selection. We -- programming costs themselves rise nearly every year, primarily driven by competition. Competition for talent, competition for shows and films. And you can see we've managed successfully through that year on year on year. And the same is true for -- during COVID when we were able to manage the slate through a prolonged and pretty unpredictable production interruptions. So -- but I really think we're not really that focused right there on how this impacts much, except for our biggest opportunity, which is to continue improving the quality of the slate. We're focused on that day in, day out, year in, year out. And I'm incredibly pleased with Bela and the team and the progress that they're making. So if you'll indulge me for just a second, I just would draw your attention to the Q4 slate as an example of that, headlined by the return of The Crown for its final season. This is one of the most ambitious television shows in the history of television. We have a new season of Big Mouth, a history -- a new season of Elite, the launch of Berlin, which is a spin-off from our La Casa de Papel, our Money Heist franchise, a new limited series like All the Light We Cannot See from Shawn Levy. That's incredible. And Bodies from the U.K. And that's just on the TV side. And on the film side, one of our strongest quarters ever. We have this enormous sci-fi spectacular from Zack Snyder, Rebel Moon; a new film from David Fincher, The Killer. And these films that just lit up the fall film festivals recently, like May December from Todd Haynes; and Bradley Cooper's Maestro; the doc feature, American Symphony. That's all coming in Q4. And for family too, we've got a new animated feature from Adam Sandler, we've Leo, that's hysterical; Chicken Run 2, which is a sequel to the most successful stop-motion animation film ever; and a new series from the CoComelon world called CoComelon Lane; Family Switch from Director McG, which stars Jennifer Garner and Ed Helm. So it's an incredible slate, something new and exciting for all taste all moods, all ages, and we're just super proud of the team that they've been able to manage through this and still deliver so much to it for our members."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'One more on strike-related -- like, just the aftermath, you discussed at a recent conference, giving talent more transparency. Could you talk about what that looks like? What are the new metrics talent will be paid on? And is it even standardized across the industry?', 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""Yes. Look, what I talked about there was heading towards a world where -- that -- where streaming data will be much more readily available. Remember, data -- streaming itself is not that exotic anymore. We've been doing it for 15 years. So we -- in the beginning, we thought there was a hard kind of apples and oranges comparison to ratings and streaming. And I think we've gotten to a place where it's mostly about engagement and that does capture the value of watching and that things will become much more transparent the way TV has always had ratings and music has always had billboard and the theatrical has always had box office. So it'll be much more common for the data to be fully transparent. What I didn't mention though is that part of that -- of our reason for not publishing early was part of our promise with creators. At the time we started creating original program, our creators felt like they were pretty trapped in this kind of overnight ratings world and weekend box office world defining their success and failures. And as we all know, a show might have enormous success down the road and it wasn't captured in that opening box office. So part of this was the relationship with talent, not just the business aspects of it. And I do think that over time, people are much more interested in this. We're on the continuum today of how much data do we publish. I think we've been leading the charge, starting everyone down the path of a top 10, publishing our top 10 list and our annual wrap-up list and everything that give a lot of transparency to the viewing. And I just expect it'll be more and more transparent."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""Great. Let's move on to paid sharing. Have you identified most of the borrowers? And can you provide any help in how much more is left to go and the challenge in completing the crackdown?"", 'Gregory K. Peters', ""Sure. I'll take that one. And I'll start by saying we're just incredibly pleased with how it's been going. And you can see the progress from our membership growth in Q2. Now in Q3, you can see it embedded in the revenue outlook for Q4. I think paid sharing represents the kind of difficult challenge where we needed to balance both important relevant consumer considerations with the importance of ensuring that our business got reasonably paid when we deliver entertainment. And it's an example where we leveraged core execution capabilities that we've been building for over a decade, sort of how you develop good product experiences, how do you solve hard problems through them, how do you have an iterative model where you listen to consumers to tell us what's working and what's not, so we've been excited about that. But because it's such a challenging problem, such -- we're shifting essentially consumers' expectations and what they expect from us, we've always thought that making this change should be done in a steady, considered way. And so our plan has been to stage out this rollout. We've been delivering our product experience to different borrower cohorts according to that plan. And as a result, I think as you're alluding to, there are a number of borrower cohorts, which has, as of today, have not received part of that experience. And just to explain that a bit. I mean, part of the motivation to stage it out is based on technical considerations. So this is our ability to build features and improve model accuracy over time in a way that allows us to ensure that we're accurately developing and applying our interventions in as effective and as positive a way for consumers as possible. Part of that has been just to stage things out based on borrower behavior. So we want to show up with the right product experience at the right moment that's more likely to convert a borrower over rather than have them spin off. So we want to think about that from maximizing long-term revenue. So we're going to continue the rollout for the next couple of quarters, and I think folks are trying to figure out how much how much juice is left there. And I would say we anticipate that we will have incremental acquisition, incremental adds for the next several quarters. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters. I think also worth noting that, that was on top of also very healthy organic, meaning not driven by paid sharing growth. So we anticipate seeing that for the next several quarters to come. And then just stepping back, there's a set of borrowers that we're not going to convert. We haven't converted yet. We're not going to convert over the next couple of quarters. But that really represents how we think about paid sharing going forward, which is it's now become part of just our standard way of operating. And we have many hundreds of millions of qualified households out there. They're smart TV households that we want to win over, over the next several years. And those borrowers we're not going to convert in the next couple of quarters represent that same group. So we got to go after them the same way we're going after people who have never signed up for Netflix, which is having an incredible content offering, an incredible value and get them so excited that they just have to sign up."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'Right. Moving on to the recent advertising restructuring. Can you talk about why you made the management change and what you would like to accomplish?', 'Gregory K. Peters', ""Yes. First, I'd say Jeremi has done a great job getting us essentially from 0 to where we are today. She'd laid the foundation for the ads business. She's hired and built a burgeoning team of leaders who, in turn, now are hiring the teams and people who are going to take the business forward. But it's an important time and I think a great time for Amy to come in and extend that great work, to build on that foundation and drive our ads business to the next level. And why am I so specifically excited about Amy in the role. First of all, she's a high Netflix tenure employee. She's been with the company for over 7 years. She's demonstrated really positive impact and great results in several different roles, but most recently as part of the studio and leading a big global team that is scaling very, very, very quickly, which sounds familiar when you think about what -- where we want to take our ads business. Second, she's got broad entertainment experience, ranging from content licensing, distribution. She's got business development, finance strategy at Netflix and in prior roles. So I think when you think about that assemblage of skills, and you think about the existing ads leadership team that we have that has got a rich, rich history in ads in general and connected TV, especially if you think about somebody like Peter Naylor, who started selling connected TV at Hulu. That's a strong team to take our ads business to the next level. And if -- and maybe I'll just -- if you -- I want to maybe just restate what we think the promise and the opportunity and sort of where we're at on ads business is. And so first of all, just starting off with, this is a $180 billion opportunity when you think about linear TV, you think about connected TV, not including YouTube, not including China and Russia. And we think we're in a great position to win some of those dollars. We've got great content. The brands want to be next to. We're a safe place for brands to exist. We got great engagement from our members. That's a really strong foundation to work with. But we got a lot of work, and we know we have a lot of work to fulfill that potential. Among that work, we've said it many times, I'll say it probably many times going forward. But scale is the #1 priority. We're making good progress there. This quarter, we grew our ad plan membership 70% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. That's on top of the last quarter where we grew at 100% quarter-to-quarter. We now have 30% of our new sign-ups choosing our ads plan in our ads countries. And we've done it by making the ads offering more competitive. We've gotten to over 95% content period with our non-ads plans. We've improved features like a number of streams, the video resolution. We're going to keep doing that. We're adding downloads now. So we'll keep that good trajectory going and keep focusing on it. Second big priority for us is delivering features and products that advertisers want. We've heard again and again, I've heard it this week, ad week from advertisers, top of that list is measurement. We've launched our measurement partnership with Nielsen in the United States this month in October. So we're excited about that. We've got a long list of other partners across other countries that we've got to deliver that same capability in, so we're excited about getting that out. We're also excited about new products. So we've rolled out our top 10 media buy. We're going to roll out our binge ad product later this year. We're launching more ways to buy programmatically through Microsoft that gives more buyers more ways to access our inventory. So we've got a lot of work to do here on all of those fronts, but we've always said this is a multiyear build, a multiyear progress. We got a lot that we've got going on, and we're excited about the future to come."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""So now that you've phased out basic for new subs and you're getting extra members or paid more per sub from password sharing crackdown you've introduced advertising in 12 countries, could you talk about the outlook for ARM in '24 and beyond?"", 'Spencer Adam Neumann', 'You want -- you guys want me to take that one?', 'Gregory K. Peters', 'Go ahead, Spence.', 'Spencer Adam Neumann', ""All right, you winded up for me. Thanks, Jessica. So I would say just generally, when we think about '24 and beyond, think about it as our revenue growth profile in general. And we talked about this recently. We expect a more balanced mix of membership and ARM growth in '24 and beyond '24. So just looking at '24 specifically, as Ted talked about, we expect to have a great slate to drive the business forward. And we expect to continue to do things like add extra members, grow our advertising revenue, as Greg discussed. And in addition, have some pricing adjustments. You saw that in our letter. All those things will drive ARM. So '23 was a pretty unusual year where essentially all of our growth came from member growth. And going forward, more broadly, not just '24 and beyond, we'll grow our business by continuing to kind of improve our service, increasing engagement, increasingly satisfying current and future members. And now that, as Greg discussed, we've got and account sharing solution, we have a more clear path to more deeply penetrate that big addressable market of 0.5 billion connected TV households and growing.And with our continued plan evolution, pricing sophistication and all that hard work growing our ads business, we'll keep getting better at monetizing that big and growing reach and engagement. So we believe we've got a long runway for growth in both kind of more membership and higher ARM over time in a more balanced way than what you saw this year, which was, again, a pretty early year."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'And then you touched on -- Greg touched on scale and advertising. How do you get to scale? Is it all through pricing, like, pricing changes? And what would you consider scale?', 'Gregory K. Peters', ""Yes. I think it's important to note that scale isn't -- it's not a binary condition, right? So it's not like you suddenly add 1 more member and you become a must-buy situation. So we become increasingly competitive with increasing reach. It's also, I think, worth noting that it's different in different countries. And it's largely based on what's the competitive channels and what's that competitive dynamic. So having said that, though, we carry several relevancy targets on a per country basis, think about this as essentially percentage of market penetration that helps us focus and drive the rate of growth that we desire. And we've got more work to do to get those. So, I mean, like, we're not satisfied with the scale that we're at in any country that we're in. We want to be bigger, and we know we can be bigger. I think there's a variety of techniques that we can employ to do that pricing and thinking about how do we factor in what's optimal pricing for ads, no ads. That's part of what we're doing and thinking about plan evolution. Part of it is what I mentioned before, which is feature set, right? These are the things that consumers want to sign up for. Part of it, too, is actually just educating consumers. I think what we are seeing is, in some of our countries, consumers think about an ads experience mostly anchored and linear in what their expectation around ad load, frequency rates are. And to some degree, actually, some of our streaming competitors haven't done maybe as great a job in building an ads experience, which informs that expectation as well. The part of it is just educating consumers about what the actual Netflix ads experience is so that they can think about what's the right choice for them. Do they want a lower price with ads and what we think is a great ads experience for consumers really, or do they want to pay more and skip ads. So it's all those things coming together that ultimately drive us to the several multiples of scale that we're at today that we'll be satisfied with."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""One last one maybe on advertising before we move on to margins. But you mentioned a lot of the innovative offerings that you plan on and some of it's sponsored. Just -- it's very unique. It's different. When do we get to a point or when will you have a point where it's targeted, addressable, so it's really relevant for consumers and so they would want to see the ads?"", 'Gregory K. Peters', ""Yes. So we're working with Microsoft right now on targeting, so you'll see that roll out in the near future. And that, I think, is the first step of how we think about increasing targeting relevance through both a combination of product sets. So what are the types of ad products that brands can buy that yield increasing relevance as well as improving our sort of sophistication on what we might call targeting from a digital perspective, which is basically matching consumers who are most interested in that particular brand's message."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""Right. So Spence, I guess this one's for you on margins. But could you elaborate on areas like ad tech, content spend? Well, you did talk about content spend in your letter, but any other meaningful investment areas, something that maybe we're not thinking about?"", 'Spencer Adam Neumann', ""Sure. So let me step back a bit with some quick context. So first, Jessica, we set margin targets. They're our best judgment of how kind of best to grow the long-term value of Netflix, and we're trying to balance investment for future growth with near-term profits. So for instance, after investing heavily to launch Global in 2016, Global Netflix, we wanted to take a disciplined approach to building profitability as we grew revenue because we felt, one, it was a good way to build that profit muscle across the company; and two, we understood that investors were -- they've been pretty patient with us, so we wanted to demonstrate the scalability and the health of the business model. And so that took us from -- it was, like, 4% OI margin, our operating income margin business in 2016 to our current roughly 20% margin. So we think a pretty good indicator that ad scale streaming can be a quite good business. Now stepping back, there's no change in our financial objectives and also no change in our long-term margin expectations, including the fact that we see a -- and we don't think we're anywhere near a margin ceiling. We've got a long runway of margin growth. So again, no change in our objectives, no change in our long-term margin expectations. But our current profitability and scale, we think it's prudent to balance that historical pace of margin improvement with growth investments. So you asked about growth investments. We think we've got a lot of places where we can continue to invest, plenty of room to invest further in our existing content categories. We're a small share of viewing in every country in which we operate. Plus building out those ads capabilities that Greg talked about, our live offering and new content categories like games, so there's plenty to do. But all that said, we'll continue to drive healthy margin expansion. We expect roughly 22% to 23% operating margin in '24, assuming no material swings in FX. So that's up from our current expectation of 20% this year, which is at the high end of the range that we targeted in the beginning of the year. So again, Jessica, just like we did in the past, going forward, we'll take a disciplined approach to balancing margin improvement with investing into our growth. We actually put a chart at the end of the letter that shows how we managed that balance historically, growing content investment, profit margins and cash flow. And you should expect that we'll carry that same discipline going forward as we invest and grow into that big opportunity we have."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""How does licensing content from third parties play into your overall content strategy? It seems like you've had incredible success with third-party content and -- I mean you always have, but in the last year, things like Suits or Band of Brothers, and you mentioned it in the letter, but if you could just talk about the third-party licensing."", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""Yes. Yes. Licensing third-party content has always been part of our strategy, and we've -- something we've been really great at being able to do is match that audience. I think Suits is a great example of the impact of the Netflix effect that we can have because of our distribution footprint and our recommendation system, we were able to take suits, which had played on cable and had played on other streaming services and pop it right into the center of the culture in a huge way, not just in the U.S. but all over the world. According to the Nielsen charts, Suits was the #1 watched streaming series for 13 straight weeks. That's like -- that is a record for Nielsen. So this continues to be important for us to add a lot of breadth of storytelling to our consumers of a wide range of taste. And we can't make everything, but we can help you find just about anything. That's really the strength. And I do think that looking -- you mentioned Band of Brothers, but in that HBO deal, we had Insecure, we had Ballers. They came out and they were very successful in Netflix, and they popped into the top 10 on their originating network for the first time. So that was on their streaming service, which is really powerful. And I think we have more to come with Six Feet Under and True Blood coming and not just on the TV side, but we're also proud to be able to bring movies like Super Mario Brothers and Spider Man across the Spider-Verse from our other suppliers. And in one way or another, we're in business with nearly every supplier, including our direct competitors. And I think that we bring a ton of value to them. And I think when you think about what happens when that show runs in and becomes a huge success on Netflix, it has lasting value. I mean, look at the value we created that still continues today for shows like Friends and The Office and Full House and Gilmore Girls and all these other shows that really found an audience on Netflix even after they have more or less played out through traditional models."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'Spence, one more on margins for you, but you said in September that long-term margins will be, I think the way you said it was similar to other networks, which historically have been in the 40% to 50% range. Could you help us think through the ramp in margins over time?', 'Spencer Adam Neumann', ""Jessica, I'll probably disappoint you as I have in the past on this. We're not going to put a long-term number out there. As I said, we don't see any ceiling, any near-term ceiling to our long-term margin potential. We've talked in the past about how we're going to feel our way through to those kind of long-term steady-state margins, but we think we have a lot of things working in our favor. We have a very scalable business model. You see that play out over the last handful of years and continue to do so as we produce content all over the world for big local impact, but also with the ability for those stories to through great subs, dubs, discovery to reach more and more people and to be enjoyed around the world. So it's a very scalable content model. It's a global network at scale that has -- in many ways, has not been seen with legacy entertainment networks. So we think we've got a long way to go. As I just talked about, we want to balance those increasing profits in the near term with investing into that long-term opportunities. So still a lot of runway that's a set of benchmarks. You can look at it. There's others as well. But suffice to say, we think we've got a long and healthy runway in terms of growing margins."", 'Spencer Wang', ""One thing I would add to that, Jessica, also I totally agree with what Spence said, which is, again, a lot of opportunity to grow margins, but profit dollars also matter, too, right? So as we expand into big new addressable markets like advertising that Greg alluded to or gaming also, right? So those open up big new sort of areas for us to expand into. And then we intend to grow margins, too, but we also want a lot of profit dollars as well. So we're not narrowly optimizing just for a percentage margin."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'Right. Of course. You announced some price changes today in premium and basic in several countries and more to come, can you provide a current view of price increase or time frame for the standards here?', 'Gregory K. Peters', ""Yes. So as you know, our focus on plan evolution over the last 18 months has largely been about paid sharing. And now that we've rolled that out, we broadly see the benefits. As I outlined in the letter, that's become a normal part of our business, which then allows us to return to our core approach to pricing. And that approach, that philosophy has not changed. We look to wisely invest the money that members pay us, deliver back to them more amazing stories, more entertainment value. And then when we think we're doing that, we'll occasionally ask them to pay a bit more to keep that virtuous circle spinning, so hence, the changes that you noted that we've announced in the letter. I think it's also worthing that we seek to have a wide and even wider over time range of price points with the corresponding set of features, of course, that allows entertainment fans from around the world that have different needs to be able to access the great storytelling that our creative partners are doing at a price point that works for them at a feature set that works for them. Part of that widespread is a low entry price point, and that's why we're keeping that low entry price point static as it is. So we think that this $6.99 in the U.S., GBP 4.99 in the U.K., EUR 5.99 in France. It's just an incredible entertainment value. And if you think about the breadth and the variety of storytelling that we're offering, whether that's compared to our streaming competitors, compared to traditional pay TV, certainly, even the price of a movie ticket, we think that's just an amazing offer. And our goal and plan is to continue to be a great entertainment value. And beyond that, we're not going to comment on other price changes or other changes on tiers. We'll sort of find our way based on that philosophy and see when the right time to ask customers to pay a little bit more would be."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'One more question on the pricing, though. Would you -- given the price increase for just premium and basic not standard, do you expect any -- or advertising tier, do you expect any movement between the tiers as a result of these price increases?', 'Gregory K. Peters', ""I think pricing always results in a bit of movement between the tiers. More of that movement is how people are signing up. So we see that as more what it influences. But also, it'll influence plan changes as well. But generally, plan changes tend to be -- our plans tend to be relatively sticky. So I would imagine that there is a -- that momentum will continue."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""So your letter today says that -- you stated that you will spend $17 billion in '24 on content spend, up from $13 billion in '23. Obviously, that was somewhat strike impacted. That is how should we -- how can you help us think through how content spend will grow beyond '24. What is normalized growth?"", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""Well, you see that we've done is we want to grow the content spend just about half a step ahead of the -- ahead of revenue to create the value proposition for our members. So the more we put into it, and a lot of it is tied to the ability to create hits out of that pool. And I would say one thing if I could, if you don't -- this past quarter, we had this really remarkable story about something that we could do. But Spence talked a little bit about the kind of scale of the content spend, but this show One Piece. One Piece is something that is a very unique property. It was created 26 years ago by Eiichiro Oda. It is over 1,000 episodes of the animated series based on the Japanese Manga. It's nearly sacred IP. And we were able to -- with our Japanese creative teams and our American teams getting together, working with our partners at Tomorrow Studios and the showrunner, Steven Maeda to adapt this into a show that the world fell in love with. And when I say to that, it's -- we've got -- this show is #1 in 84 countries around the world, which is something that Stranger Things couldn't -- didn't do, that Wednesday didn't do.And it's so rare for an English show to be that popular in Japan and Korea, Brazil and in the U.S. at the same time. And the other fun part of it is Iñaki Godoy, who stars in the show, it was one of the most difficult casting challenges in the history of our original programming was who's going to play Monkey D. Luffy and he was right under our nose, right in our talent family.We discovered him a couple of years ago, met him in this great show at our Mexican series called Who Killed Sara, and then we were able to cast him in this and now he's a global superstar. So this is that kind of thing you could do well, a thing that's hard to copy and gives us kind of competitive running room from our competitors, being able to do that more and more. I don't mean -- when I say that, I don't mean making things more global, I think making things that really resonate for the core audience. And usually, local audiences want very local content. And in this case, the local audience is the fan of One Piece, which was very discriminating, and we had to please them first, just like our original shows in Spain have to really please the Spanish customer first. So we can do this. We spend the money well. We have impact with the spend, and we grow it as we grow revenue."", 'Spencer Adam Neumann', ""Maybe -- sorry, go ahead -- Jessica. I was just going to build kind of a little bit on Ted's point on the kind of trajectory of content spend. So -- and we talked about this a little bit in the past. So first, in the letter, we talk about that after '24, we hope to get cash content spend back up to you at or near that $17 billion level. The biggest swing factor is going to be when the SAG-AFTRA strike resolves. And so that'll get us to a cash to P&L ratio kind of closer to 1:1.1x. And so we're not putting a specific number out there for free cash flow in '24. What that gets us to, when you think about the combination of our revenue growth outlook, our margin guidance and target cash content spend, we'll deliver substantial free cash flow in '24. And then going beyond that, we do expect to tick up our content investment over time as we also prove out sustained healthy revenue growth. So assuming -- we talked about it, I think, in the last call. Assuming no big expansions, we'd expect our cash to P&L ratio of content spend cash to content amort in the P&L to be roughly 1.1x. So that's kind of one way folks are thinking about how to model our growth in content spend. If we -- as we grow our revenue, as we improve our profitability, we should see both increasing content spend but also free cash flow growing nicely over time."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""And then just 1 last -- just a follow-up for Ted though. There's so much going on in content right now. Can you maybe talk about investment priorities? Like, how do you think about whether it's local language film, TV? You've made a lot of deals with some third-party film companies, television companies. Could you give us some color on how you think about content spend?"", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', 'Yes. We always have a lot of plate spinning because our members have got such different tastes and different desires. And we\'re trying to please them all and like I say, trying to find that person who really fell in love with us for Prestige TV and then discovered Love is Blind. That\'s a pretty common household to be honest with you.So we\'ve got to be able to be good at so many different things. And our partnerships, I\'m assuming you\'re talking about Skydance in this case, is -- it really helps us find and keep up that scale as we grow. So we\'re really thrilled with our success in animated features. It\'s a very long cycle of development and production. Sometimes it could take a decade to deliver a really great animated feature film. And as you know, we move pretty fast, and we\'ve been moving pretty fast. And no single company has ever really successfully launched more than 2 animated features in a single year. So we wanted -- that deal helps us to complement the work that we\'re doing, like you saw this year with Leo and Chicken Run coming out and Nimona that already came out. So we\'ve got a very -- there\'s a ton of appetite. If you look at the top 10 animated features of since Nielsen\'s been tracking movie watching and 7 of them are animated features. So there\'s a lot of appetite for animated features, and we\'re committed to that part of the business. And we do that through a combination of licensing, partnerships and original production and original creation, and not just the U.S. but all over the world. So we have to find that right balance of invest, finding the right product market fit, which helps us grow those territories, and most importantly, helps create a value proposition for consumers, and they could say, ""Hey, that -- what I pay for Netflix, I can pay a little bit more because I get so much value there, and I\'m spending so much of my time there."" So if you think about the -- for the last 37 of the last 38 weeks of this year, Netflix has had the #1 streaming series on -- of all -- in all of streaming. And for 31 of those 38 weeks, we\'ve had the #1 movie, too. And in any given week, we might have had the #1, 2 and 3. So we really -- we\'ve got a lot going on and we\'ve got to stay focused on continuing to improve the value proposition to consumers, which drive the numbers that we\'ve been talking about on this call.', 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'Spence, you announced a very significant increase in your buyback today. Should we think of the $2.5 billion buyback in the third quarter as sort of a run rate moving forward?', 'Spencer Adam Neumann', ""I wouldn't kind of read through to that, Jessica. We had kind of slowed down as we -- as the business slowed down and we wanted to -- we talked about the fact that we had less than typical forward visibility into our forecast over the past year or so as we were looking to reaccelerate the business and also roll out paid sharing. And now much of that is behind us, as we've said, and we've got a better view going forward and so we ramped up our repurchase because we had built up some cash on the balance sheet as well. Our target minimum cash is roughly 2 months of revenue. So plus or minus $6 billion of cash that we look to hold on our balance sheet, and we've gotten ahead of that, are still a little ahead of that. So -- but that's really what we're managing, too, is to: one, primarily drive the business forward, grow the business, expand our cash flow; and then as cash -- excess cash builds on the balance sheet, to return it to shareholders. So we put a pretty specific target out there of roughly 2 months of revenue in the form of cash on the balance sheet, and that's the way I think you should think about what our pacing will be over time."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', 'Moving on to gaming. It feels like almost like the way you described advertising, like a walk, crawl, run approach. What is a near and midterm strategy in gaming?', 'Gregory K. Peters', ""Well, let's start with the big prize. I think that's the better way to look at it, which is games is a huge entertainment opportunity. So we're talking about $140 billion worth of consumer spend on games outside of China and outside of Russia. And from a strategic perspective, we believe that we can build games into a strong content category, leveraging our current core film and series by connecting members, especially members that are fans of specific Ips, with games that they will love.I think it's worth noting that if we can make those connections and as we make those connections as we're seeing, we're essentially sidestepping the biggest issue that the mobile games market has today, which is how do you cost effectively acquire new players. So that's the real proposition. We think if we deliver that, we give members great games, entertainment experiences that they love at sufficient scale, then we leverage back into the core business. We increase engagement. We increase retention. We Increase value delivered. Those all drive our core business metrics. And I think it's actually just a very natural extension of what you were just talking with Ted about. If you think about the range of content that we're offering, the variety of content and entertainment that we're offering, games just adds 1 extra layer to that variety and that depth. And we're also seeing, I would say, back to moving it more to your short term and midterm. We're also seeing performance metrics that support that this fundamental strategic hypotheses are sound. So games engagement right now on our service drives core business metrics in a way which is incremental to movies and series.So -- but the main challenge ahead of us, to get to your midterm, is that our current scale and, frankly, our current investment level are both very, very, very small relative to our overall content spend and engagement. So now our job is to incrementally scale to the place where games have a material impact on the business. We've got ambitious plans there. We want to really grow our engagement by many multiples of where it is today over the next handful of years. And we can see how to get there. Looking a layer deeper at the title level, we see -- some titles are really working for our members, and they're working for our business. If we can do more of those, we know we can scale into that proposition. We've got to do that through better title selection based on everything that we're learning. We got to do it on better product features to maximize connection with the audience for any given title. And we have to do it by gradually improving consumer awareness, which is we've seen as when we launched other content categories. You can think about unscripted or you can think about film, that broadly lifts overall engagement metrics as consumers learn that we're a place to go to, to find games. I'm excited about what we got going on in Q4. We're going to launch some big, high-profile titles which sort of keeps that drumbeat going. We got Dead Cells. We've got Football Manager 2024. We've got Money Heist. Think about connections with our IP that's coming in Q4 as well. That's Casa De Papel for folks who have -- saw it in that language. We also have Virgin River coming in Q1. So as you pointed out, this trajectory is not dissimilar from what we've seen before, when we've launched a new region. Think about Latin America or we launched a country like Japan where traditional Western media companies have struggled or we launched new genres like unscripted. We've got to crawl, walk, run and we build it, but we see a tremendous amount of opportunity to build a long-term center value of entertainment, more entertainment value for our members."", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""That's a great experience for the super fan to get themselves in the universe in between seasons of a show. It's really exciting."", 'Spencer Wang', 'Jessica, we have time for about 2 last questions, please.', 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""Okay, great. I'll get to it and so the first of the 2, sports. You're creating the Netflix Cup Tournament to be your next month. Is this a change in your sports strategy at all? Or how should we think about that?"", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""Yes. I knew this was coming, Jessica. We are in the sports business, but we're in the part of the sports business that we bring the most value to, which is the drama of sport. So look at the success we've had with Drive to Survive. Look at the success we've had with Tour de France, Quarterback, Full Swing, Untold, most recently with Beckham. David Beckman is one of the biggest stars in the world and his documentary on Netflix brought him almost 0.5 million new social media followers in a week. So we are having a big impact on sports through the thing that we're most great at, which is the drama of sport. The Netflix Cup is a live event that actually brings together the cast of Drive to Survive and Full Swing and puts them into a live golf tournament that we are going to stream live on Netflix on November 14. And it's -- I think about it as a great way of extending those great drama of sport brands that we've created. But no core change in our live sport strategy or licensing and live sports. We are investing heavily in increasing our live capabilities so that as we -- as the demand grows for that and we find different ways, the liveness can be part of the creative storytelling, we want to be able to do that at a big scale."", 'Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich Cohen', ""There was some news also today, I guess, on comedy. But my last question, to stay with where Spencer is, you've talked a little bit more recently about your ancillary businesses, including the Netflix House. Can you talk about what that looks like over time? And will it be a big investment area? But more importantly, will it be a contributor?"", 'Theodore A. Sarandos', ""Yes. Look at the -- this initiative lives inside of our Consumer Products and Experiences Group. Today, they run these successful businesses where they travel these live experiences all over the world and fans engage in them in ways that would shock you. People love these things so much, they show up. Dozens of people have proposed marriage in the -- at the Bridgerton Ball. It's really important, in a way, to kind of deepen fandom, a way to express fandom. You kind of see it on a large scale with theme parks. These build-outs are not going to be like a theme park, both in that they won't have that gigantic CapEx. And they also -- we expect that fans will go multiple times a year, not just once every couple of years. And it's a way to take a business that's really good at growing our brands and strengthening our brands.And today, it doesn't -- has a big start-up and shutdown costs as they travel around and put them under 1 umbrella where we can add a little technology and make it a really phenomenal experience from being as part of the Money Heist, Escape Room or the Stranger Things experience or the Squid Game challenge, all those different things that people can do live together and have a lot of fun. And they can also go to the Netflix Bites and have food experience with all the Netflix food brands. So it really kind of strengthens the brands and strengthens the excitement about the things people are watching on Netflix and falling in love with. It gives them a place to go and express it. It's not a material investment relative to the court, to the big business that we're all in. But it's a great way of building it, like our consumer products business."", 'Spencer Wang', ""Great. Well, great well, Jessica, thank you very much for your questions, and we appreciate everybody tuning into our earnings call. And we're looking forward to chatting with you all next quarter, if not sooner. Thank you.""]"

The company is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. The U.S. Navy procures these submarines in multi-boat blocks at a two-per-year rate.This reflects the strong demand that the Viginia-Class submarine program enjoys in the marine warfare space, which results in solid order inflow from the Pentagon, like the latest one. Such orders should bolster GD’s future revenue generation prospects.', 'Increasing geopolitical tensions across the globe and maritime disputes are anticipated to drive investments in submarines, which are considered one of the most critical elements of a country’s naval force.The global submarine market is valued at $30.0 billion in 2023 and is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate of more than 4% during 2023-2033, as predicted by GlobalData’s report. During this period, the market is expected to be dominated by the nuclear-powered attack submarine segment (SSN).Such solid growth projections should boost GD’s top-line performance in the coming days, with its Marine Systems unit being one of the leading designers and builders of nuclear-powered submarines.In recent times, the company has been offered multiple submarine contracts from the U.S. Navy. In October 2023, GD won a $967 million contract modification for Lead Yard Support and Development and Design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'NRG Energy in Focus', ""Based in Houston, NRG Energy (NRG) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 32.06%.

This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.93% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.7%."", ""Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. Over the last 5 years, NRG Energy has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 77.73%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 39%, meaning it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Earnings growth looks solid for NRG for this fiscal year.

It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout."", 'High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.', 'Many analysts now believe the market volatility and uncertainty that started in 2022 is far from over. The Federal Reserve is still in a wait and see mode when it comes to rate hikes. Investors are continuing to look over their shoulders for incoming data to gauge the state of the consumer in the country and whether inflation is really cooling as many optimistic corners of the market like to suggest. In this environment, dividend stocks remain relevant as history shows dividend equities always perform better during troubled times. Consider this, in just two weeks in February 2023, investors poured a whopping $272 million into U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds that buy dividend-paying stocks, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. These funds saw inflows of $48 billion in 2022. However, when 2023 started off with a bang thanks in part to the AI boom and rise of tech stocks, these funds saw an exodus of $835 million. But amid expectations of more rate hikes and recession in 2024, dividend stocks are expected to continue to gain relevance and traction.', 'While short-term volatility and market uncertainty is fueling dividend stocks’ attraction, the fact remains that having a long-term investment horizon boosts the returns of dividend investing. For example, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of S&P 500 companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend increases, has outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 75% since 1989. A T. Rowe Price report from March 2023 said that when a company is consistently raising its dividends, it’s evident that it’s handling its cash and business properly and its future prospects are bright. However, the report pointed to a pitfall of dividend investing. It’s easier for investors to get lured into high yields. But the report said that if a company has a low but growing dividend, it should be considered for the following reasons:', '“Avoiding low‑yield stocks without a careful evaluation of the companies’ prospects comes with pitfalls. Low yet growing dividends may point to companies that are on a path of earnings expansion, with cash flows that are starting to exceed their capital expenditure needs. These stocks may ultimately generate sizable total returns through dividends and earnings growth combined. Understanding their commitment to shareholder returns and emphasis on dividends is especially important when assessing these companies.”', 'Image by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology', 'For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with dividend yields of 3%, average Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts and price targets 50% higher than their current prices.

General Assembly to discuss how to accelerate action on the sustainable development goals, including reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality, Nathan discusses the role the private sector can play in delivering services in a commercially sustainable and scalable way and how people can harness digitization and their own data to improve their lives and livelihoods.', '""We\'re peeling back the layers to a problem and creating solutions,"" Nathan says. ""Digitization is helping to bring critical services and brighter opportunities to people in developing markets - and Mastercard is working to bridge the stiff digital divide.""', 'For this episode and more Mastercard podcasts, see our Spotify page', 'About Community Pass:', 'Nearly half of the world today struggles to meet their basic needs - including access to food, education and basic healthcare. Technology has brought profound change to much of the world. Yet digitally excluded individuals in remote communities face challenges breaking the cycle of poverty - especially with the lack of infrastructure. They are often served by a range of disjointed service providers and lack a consistent process to access education, aid, micro-commerce and healthcare services and to build financial resilience. Community Pass facilitates life transactions for the digitally excluded and underserved.', 'With no consistent ID or credentials, onboarding and servicing digitally excluded individuals is often manual, inefficient and expensive. Community Pass is a shared, interoperable digital platform that disparate service providers can use to effectively increase access and reduce the cost of delivering essential services. Community Pass creates a unique digital identity for each individual user, which enables the individual to access critical services provided by multiple service providers - such as banks and NGOs - on the platform. With Community Pass, service providers will have access to key features that enable digital transactions: a functional identity, a shared wallet, a digital acceptance device and a secure and safe data platform.', 'User Benefits', ""Community Pass promotes sustainable economic development by welcoming digitally excluded individuals into the formal digital economy. Leveraging Mastercard's best-in-class data privacy and protection by design standards, Community Pass digitalizes life and financial transactions to connect individuals to what they need: food and humanitarian aid, education and basic healthcare, digital savings, and the ability to support one's self and their family on the path to prosperity."", 'Key Features', 'Community Pass enables service providers to expand their access and reach, reduce costs and realise new revenue opportunities. Its shared infrastructure can be used across multiple products and by different types of providers, such as financial institutions, ag-techs, health techs, mobile network operators, development organisations and governments.', 'To learn more about Community Pass, visit our website.', 'Check out more content from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mastercard on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: MastercardWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Mastercard', 'View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/794592/mastercard-audio-podcast-building-the-digital-rails-to-go-the-last-mile']"

Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program.', 'This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy.', ""Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1 LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in-flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability."", 'In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSC missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1 LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSC. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future.', ""International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong. As demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSCs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another longstanding major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents."", ""The TRIDENT II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid."", ""After a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-REx. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?"", ""Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses."", ""On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy."", 'Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15 through 17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina.', ""The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon. Today's latest version, the Block 772 will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within tactical strike missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments."", ""Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production launch as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record."", 'This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, fleet ballistic missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million transport layer tranche two award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking.', ""With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario."", ""These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress."", ""On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And at free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth and free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first three quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow."", ""We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A."", 'See also The 30 Most Underpaid Jobs in America and 16 Best Investing Podcasts in 2023.', 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.', 'Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Doug.', ""Doug Harned: I wanted to see if - just could I understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now the TR3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have like total confidence in that time frame. And what I'm trying to understand is as you continue to produce F-35s, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenue should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production recognition of revenues, earnings and cash flow, should that date move around, how should we think about the timing here?"", ""Jay Malave: So Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. And so that will - could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15 to 17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15 to 17 than we did on Lot 12 through 14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one."", 'Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', ""Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Jay, I think recently, you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for '24. But I think one of the issues that kind of you mentioned has been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that impacts could impact next year? And any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins? Thank you."", ""Jay Malave: Sure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really - it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins."", ""So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that - as far as any others, look, we - if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024."", ""Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force filed experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there."", 'Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', ""Kristine Liwag: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35 and current partners like Israel, have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?"", ""Jim Taiclet: So Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our Joint Program Office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the Joint Program Office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other..."", ""Jay Malave: Yes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer."", 'Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.', ""George Shapiro: Yes. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%? And I'll sneak in one other one, which is in RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur? Thanks."", ""Jay Malave: Okay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are - and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery - program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%."", 'Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein.', 'Jim Taiclet: Lois, are you still there?', ""Operator: Yes. One moment. We're opening his line. I'm sorry, the next person that we will go to is David Straus from Barclays. Please go ahead."", 'David Strauss: Hi, good morning, everyone.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning, David.', ""David Strauss: Jay, I think the IRS came up with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I want to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it's supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of - or a higher associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns? Thanks."", ""Jay Malave: Sure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension, I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year."", ""We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of two things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since - from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contribution, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025."", ""And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point."", 'Operator: The next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', ""Ken Herbert: Yes, hi. Good morning, Jay and Jim. Maybe, Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal '24 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the '24 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact me? Maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment?"", ""Jay Malave: Sure. So year-to-date, 0we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there."", ""But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean. It does - you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase."", ""Operator: The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard, and he's from Vertical Research. Please go ahead."", 'Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Rob.', ""Rob Stallard: A question for Jim or Jay. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing U.S. budget uncertainty and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?"", ""Jay Malave: It's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last two years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year."", 'Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.', 'Richard Safran: Thanks. Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you?', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning.', ""Richard Safran: So if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume to get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year is, what was - how you see backlog growth and the book-to-bill is better than 1?"", ""Jay Malave: Richard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024."", 'Richard Safran: Thanks.', 'Jay Malave: Welcome.', 'Operator: The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu: Can you guys hear me?', 'Jim Taiclet: Yes. We can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning.', ""Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask Jim and Jay, you're a pretty confident management team just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed given the backdrop is seemingly better, is it just a budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you can just comment on that."", ""Jay Malave: Well, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We - I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis since starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January."", ""Jim Taiclet: In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly. And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time."", ""And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term."", 'Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.', 'Seth Seifman: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning.', 'Jay Malave: Good morning.', ""Seth Seifman: Maybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year, did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of solid rocket motors, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs? Thanks."", ""Jim Taiclet: I'll talk to solid rocket motors and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important."", ""So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on."", ""Jay Malave: On the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental. Pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January."", 'Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.', ""Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Jay, a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're seeing on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? Or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talked about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years?"", ""Jim Taiclet: So digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like Defense of Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD."", ""So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future."", ""Jay Malave: Okay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year."", 'Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Noah Poponak: Hello, everyone.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning.', 'Jay Malave: Hi.', ""Noah Poponak: Jay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins, and you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year next year or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses? And then I just wondered if you could talk about how - a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs here with prices fixed a little while ago. Was - is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you - my understanding is you also no bid missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor? Or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?"", ""Jay Malave: Well, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really two different programs. I think you're referring to the standard Stand-in Attack Weapon award, and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively."", ""And hence, we're starting - we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are - this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the - we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me."", ""Jim Taiclet: And Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take - we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program, this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done. We would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things."", 'Maria Ricciardone Lee: Okay. And Lois, I think we have time for one more as we approach the top of the hour.', 'Operator: Thank you so much. And that question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.', ""Jason Gursky: Yes. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you would do us a favor, just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplemental, what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all? And then Jay, related to international here, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else be equal, see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business? Thanks."", ""Jim Taiclet: Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government, what, when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles."", ""So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine."", ""Jay Malave: And on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited - at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS."", ""Maria Ricciardone Lee: All right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts."", ""Jim Taiclet: Sure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well."", 'So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.', 'Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conference, and you may now disconnect.']"

With mortgage rates soaring to a 23-year high, the industry is experiencing its lowest levels of sentiment since January 2023. According to the National Association of Home Builders (“NAHB”) report released on Oct 17, the Monthly Housing Market Index (HMI) reading paints a bleak picture for the market.', 'Builder confidence in newly built single-family homes fell by four points to 40 in October, marking the third consecutive monthly drop in sentiment. All three major HMI indices declined, with the index for current sales conditions dropping four points to 46, the sales expectations in the next six months plummeting five points to 44, and the gauge for traffic of prospective buyers dipping four points to 26.', ""One major factor contributing to this decline is the surge in mortgage rates, which have remained above 7% for the past two months. Higher rates are deterring potential buyers, particularly younger ones, who are finding themselves priced out of the market. Additionally, the increased cost and availability of builder development and construction loans are hurting the supply, further damaging housing affordability.According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.57% for the week ending Oct 12, 2023. This was an eight-point increase from the previous week. The last time rates were this high was in December 2000. This surge was driven by the Federal Reserve's higher-for-longer monetary policy stance, strong third-quarter economic growth, and concerns over government budget deficits.The housing affordability crisis remains a significant challenge. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz highlighted that the solution lies in adding attainable, affordable supply. Increasing housing production is vital in tackling shelter inflation, which was responsible for over half of the Consumer Price Index's rise in September. Additionally, this would align with the Federal Reserve's mission to bring inflation back down to 2%. However, monetary policy uncertainty is adding to the affordability issues in the market."", 'To combat the impact of high-interest rates, many builders are slashing home prices to stimulate sales. In October, 32% of builders reported cutting home prices, a rate unchanged from the previous month but the highest since December 2022. The average price discount remains at 6%. Furthermore, 62% of builders offered sales incentives of all forms in October, up from 59% in September, tying with the previous high set in December 2022.', ""The decline in builder confidence in the face of soaring mortgage rates is a concerning trend for the homebuilding industry. Challenges stemming from higher rates, monetary policy uncertainty, and an affordability crisis are putting pressure on builders. The industry must navigate these obstacles to continue providing housing solutions for a growing population.The hope for a rebound in sentiment largely depends on the trajectory of these rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Until then, the market is likely to see builders continuing to make price cuts and offering incentives to entice buyers.In this challenging environment, potential homebuyers may discover chances to acquire a new residence at more budget-friendly rates. However, the industry's journey to resurgence critically relies on steering through the tumultuous waters of elevated mortgage rates and economic unpredictability. The housing market's future will continue to be intricately linked to the choices and initiatives of the Federal Reserve in the forthcoming months."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Notably, homebuilders like Lennar Corporation LEN, D.R.

By comparison, real GDP actually expanded at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 while unemployment is at just 3.9%. Nevertheless, workers and investors still have to deal with inflation and the housing crisis, which are bound to lead to dissatisfaction.', 'Investing in this environment is difficult but not impossible. Indeed, Munger, Buffett and other billionaires are beating the economic gloom with savvy investments. Following their lead could help you supercharge your finances during tough economic times — and hopefully help improve your perspective on the state of affairs in the process.', 'The housing crisis is a genuine issue. And Berkshire Hathaway is betting on the solution. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households created than housing units completed. This gap is one of the key reasons for the housing unaffordability that’s already throttled many American cities and is rapidly spreading to others.', 'Naturally, this creates intense pressure to build more homes. That’s why Buffett and Munger added stakes in some of the largest homebuilders to his portfolio. During the second quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway added D.R. Horton (DHI) , NVR Inc. (NVR) and Lennar Corp.

During the Great Recession of 2008, the number of visits to hospitals and purchases of pharmaceuticals didn’t drop.

This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will start by reviewing the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions."", 'Joaquin Duato, our chairman and CEO; John Reed, and Ahmet Tezel, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech R&D leaders, as well as Erik Haas, our VP of Litigation, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. As a reminder, on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced the final results of the exchange offer and completion of the separation of Kenvue Inc. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Additionally, going forward, the pharmaceutical segment will be referred to as innovative medicine.', 'Starting with Q3 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8% versus the third quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 6.4% as currency had a positive impact of 0.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 11.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 0.7% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 0.9 points. It is important to note that operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.9% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S., and 0.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings.', 'For the quarter, net earnings were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.69 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.62 a year ago. Excluding after-tax and tangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing increases of 14.1% and 19.3% respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.9%. I will now comment on business sales performance. Unless otherwise stated percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2022 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation.', 'Beginning with innovative medicine. Worldwide innovative medicine sales of $13.9 billion, increased 5.1% with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 4.3% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.2%, with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and growth of 4.3% outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from a recently launched products with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 20.7% and 27% respectively, due to continued share gains and market growth.', ""Within immunology, we saw growth in STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 15.8% and 21.5% respectively. This growth was predominantly driven by favorable patient mix and market growth. Turning to newly launched products, we continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth and other oncology. We expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total innovative medicine sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA and REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales, due to competitive pressures. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased 10% with growth of 11.6% in the U.S., and 8.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 10.4% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4 points."", ""Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth, excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6%. On a pro forma basis, utilizing sales in the prior year from Abiomed as a standalone company, MedTech's growth for the quarter would be 6.4%. MedTech was negatively impacted across all platforms by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 60 basis points in volume-based procurement in China, primarily in five MedTech platforms: Spine, Trauma, Endocutters, Energy, and Electrophysiology. As communicated last quarter, we saw the return to more normalized seasonality with moderate deceleration in the third quarter. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 48.1%, which includes $311 million related to Abiomed."", 'This reflects growth in Abiomed patient procedures in the high-teens and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology in surgery. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to this growth with a double-digit increase of 20.3%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OPTRELL Mapping Catheters. Operational growth of 3.2% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 5.4% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision.', ""Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve. Global vision growth was negatively impacted by 100 basis points, due to the Blink divestiture. Orthopedics operational growth of 2.6% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products, such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions, and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China in Spine and Trauma. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin was flat due to favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit costs in the innovative medicine business, partially offset by commodity inflation, unfavorable product mix, and restructuring related to excess inventory costs in the MedTech business."", 'Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 40 basis points, driven by increased expenses across the enterprise. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 16.2% of sales this quarter. R&D was leveraged by 120 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments in the innovative medicine business. Additionally, IPR&D impairments were $206 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income was $182 million in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt balances.', 'The other income and expense line was an expense of $499 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $226 million in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on public securities partially offset by the lower COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs and lower litigation expense. Restructuring in the third quarter was $158 million, primarily related to the innovative medicine restructuring program announced in the first quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.4% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a non-deductible, non-recurring pre-tax charge that occurred in the current quarter. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year.', ""As a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson is presenting the consumer health business financial results as discontinuing operations, including a gain of approximately $21 billion. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax and separation-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35.3% to 37.6%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and innovative medicine, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and commodity inflation in MedTech."", ""Innovative medicine margins improved from 41.4% to 45.4%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and R&D portfolio prioritization. MedTech margins declined from 25% to 24.7%, primarily driven by commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix partially offset by a divestiture gain. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?"", ""Joe Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson & Johnson with a sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech. What has remained consistent is our Credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137-year legacy of tackling the world's most complex healthcare challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world. As we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of healthcare. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future. Before we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business."", ""The first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation, which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted timeframe and under budget, while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders. Through the separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue Debt Offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. We maintained our current quarterly dividend per share and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility. We will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024. Another item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act."", ""We continue to believe the IRA's price setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients. As we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by of us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS' drug price setting scheme to continue supporting patients' access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer. Moving to segment highlights in the quarter, as Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter, while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth. Within the innovative medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma."", 'And U.S. FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class, bi-specific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Regarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late breaking abstracts, including three featured in the Presidential Symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three Phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including MARIPOSA, MARIPOSA II, and PAPILLON. Additionally, updated data from the Sunrise 1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer will be shared, as well as the first ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGFR mutations. We also look forward to presenting Phase II data for Nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in November, and have already launched a Phase II combination study NRA.', 'Lastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. This includes the initiation of the ANTHEM Phase 2B study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month, and the Phase III clinical program titled Iconic for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expected to begin in November. Moving to MedTech, notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform. We received FDA clearance from multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson & Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy-related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures.', 'It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams. In pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE mark for our VARIPULSE Catheter. We expect the completion for our U.S. VARIPULSE study to occur in the fourth quarter. We are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STSF dual energy catheter, capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device, and Omnipulse, a large tip focal catheter. Beyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the Abiomed Impella ECP clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high-risk PCI procedures.', ""Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small bore access and closure techniques. While not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our orthopedic business. As part of this two-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. We anticipate some short-term modest revenue disruption in orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability."", ""The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the $5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute a strategic and disciplined approach utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth, and executing share repurchases when appropriate."", 'Moving onto our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first nine months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full-year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%, or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%. Just a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue. While we do not speculate on future currency movements utilizing the euro spot rate as of last week at 1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million resulting in a full-year impact of negative 1% or $800 million.', 'Looking across the P&L, adjusted pre-tax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained, ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Due to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million. And finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 to $10.08 or 12.5% growth at the midpoint, and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13 or 13% growth at the midpoint.', ""Since January, We've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and $0.25 on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing $0.10 for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023. Now I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024, and our teams are actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider. For innovative medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all while advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings, and approvals ahead of us."", 'This includes data presentations and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our Phase III study of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis, and readouts from two Phase III or ELITA trials in early-stage prostate cancer. We do not expect the entry of STELARA Biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid-2024 in Europe. For MedTech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all MedTech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness, while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, Abiomed, and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels.', ""With respect to tax, as you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's Pillar 2 Directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD Pillar 2 framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1st, 2024. As a result, we currently estimate it up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024. In addition, the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of U.S. incentives for innovation and will result in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Regarding share count given the Kenvue separation, the full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson & Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials."", ""And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate $0.15 negative currency impact on 2024 full-year adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our strong performance during the first nine months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our innovative medicine and MedTech pipelines, and the long-term strategy of Johnson & Johnson at our upcoming Enterprise Business Review on December 5th at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule, will be shared shortly.

Your line is now live.', ""David Risinger: Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the strong financial performance. So my question is on benchmarking MARIPOSA results, please. Could you share your thoughts on key considerations, including AstraZeneca's recent FLAURA2 results, which included a nine-month PFS benefit? Thanks very much."", ""John Reed: Hi. John, Reed here. It's great to join the call. This is my first time as a newcomer to J&J, and before I answer your question, David, I would just like to say I have to tell you I'm really enjoying being a new member of the J&J team. I've really been impressed with the culture inspired by our Credo with the caliber of our talent our people here at J&J and with the really strong performance of the pipeline. We've already launched two NMEs this year, Akeega for prostate cancer and TALVEY for myeloma, continuing our tradition in bringing new therapies in those agents, and we're positioned to deliver an average of more than two enemies per year between now and the close of the decade 2030.

So we're embargoed until then. Abstracts will be available on [Wednesday] (ph). I can only say that the RYBREVANT Lazertinib combo did perform well head-to-head against Osimertinib. Our regimen is a chemo-free option for patients, which we think is important, and we'll present those data at ESMO."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question today is from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live.', ""Matt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So I think most folks may look at the orthopedic results in medical devices as maybe being a little bit softer-than-expected. And I know that's not everything by a long shot for J&J, but given the expectations for continued strength heading, I think, into Q3, if you could talk maybe a little bit about your comment on more traditional seasonality and thoughts on the sustainability of that strength, as well as the sort of divestiture and sort of realignment plan, Joe, that you described. Thanks."", 'Joaquin Duato: So thank you for the question. And yes, I mean, our results in orthopedics were 2.6% growth overall. And part of it, as you mentioned is driven by seasonality. As we have commented, we are in a journey of improvement in orthopedics. We want to be number one and number two in every segment we compete. And that is a place where we are not there yet, but we are very confident that we are going to continue to make improvements by investing and by growing in the highest growth segments. We have made improvements in our portfolio, for example, on the knee side. We have a more complete portfolio now on the revision side, on the cementless side. We are launching now our VELYS orthopedics total robot, total knee surgery replacement in Europe.', 'And we already have about 30,000 procedures that have been performed with our VELYS robotic system. Overall, we are increasing our penetration also in the ASCs, which is a fast-growing segment, and we see our performance continue to improve in the U.S. and globally. In this particular quarter, we also had some impact due to the impact of value-based procurement in China and also because of the impact of the Russia sanctions that was mentioned already in the previous remarks. So overall, in orthopedics, we are determined to continue our journey of improvement. We are focusing in having the right portfolio. We have a very strong team in the field, and as Joe has announced, and Joe can comment on that, we have a plan to be able to continue to improve our margins in orthopedics.', ""Joe Wolk: Yes, just very quickly, Matt, thanks for the question. With respect to the restructuring program that we announced specifically in orthopedics, we're looking to exit those less profitable markets and product lines. So we'll have some clearly inventory write-downs as a result of that. Over the next two years, there will be some modest revenue disruption, but we actually do think these actions not only accelerate growth going forward, but will improve profitability."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.', 'Chris Shibutani: Great. Thank you very much. Can you provide us with some insight into updates on the TALC litigation process? And then secondly, if you could just comment, Joe, you used the word voracious last time with your appetite for business development opportunities. How does that word stand still in terms of your appetite on the floor? Thank you.', ""Joe Wolk: Hey, so Eric, why don't I turn it over to you to discuss the TALC litigation matter and then I'll come back and answer Chris's second question."", ""Erik Haas: Great. Thanks, Joe. The short answer is that we continue to pursue the four-pronged strategy that we communicated back in July. So let me quickly summarize those four prongs and highlight the salient developments and perhaps anticipate some follow-up questions about TALC. So the first prong, we are pursuing the appeal through to the Supreme Court of the United States of the July ruling by the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court that dismissed LTL's bankruptcy case. Notably, our appeal recently was joined by counsel representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants. Also, thereafter, the bankruptcy court certified the case for a direct appeal to the third circuit, bypassing the district court, because the bankruptcy court found that the appeal raises matters of significant public interest, the resolution of which would material advance the progress of the case and we fully agree with that assessment."", 'The appeal challenges both the validity, as well as the application of the novel standard that was imposed by the third circuit that requires a showing of, “immediate financial distress” to proceed with the bankruptcy case. That immediate financial distress requirement, which the third circuit did not specifically define, is nowhere in the bankruptcy code and is contrary to the standards that are implied -- employed by other circuits. Moreover, under any reasonable interpretation of that standard, we believe the record has fully established that LTL faced immediate financial distress due to the large volume of TALC claims that were asserted against it. In terms of timing, the third circuit could rule at any moment whether it will take the direct appeal or not.', ""If it does, we expect briefing to take place over the next couple of months with a decision in the early 2024 timeframe. And because we do anticipate the third circuit will primarily affirm the application of its standards, we will immediately thereafter request the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split and decide if the third circuit's novel approach is an appropriate standard for deciding a motion to dismiss. We do not think it is. We hope to squeeze the cert petition to the Supreme Court into the first term in 2024, but if not, we will raise it in the second term. Working with the council, representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants more than we had previously that were along with us. Along with the -- in addition to the future claims representatives and together with the council and the future claims representatives were pursuing a consensual resolution of the TALC claims through another bankruptcy."", ""And that is exactly what the bankruptcy court, the New Jersey bankruptcy court urged and strongly recommended that we do in its decision that actually dismissed the case. And the New Jersey court made those recommendations having found that LTL had made remarkable progress towards an equitable and efficient resolution to-date. So we are continuing on in that process. In terms of timing on the second prong, the consensual resolution is on the same trajectory as the initial bankruptcy plan with a vote expected in the next six months to determine whether the requisite super majority of claimants support the plan. Third, while those negotiations are proceeding, we will continue to vigorously defend the meritless TALC claims in the tort system. As you may have seen just this last week, we had a significant favorable ruling in that regard with the New Jersey's appellate court in the Barden case reversing a $223 million verdict against the company."", ""The appellate court reversed because it determined the opinions of the leading plaintiff's experts were unsound, were unscientific, and were unsubstantiated. And it is that baseless nature of those expert opinions why we have prevailed in the vast majority of the cases that have been tried to-date. In terms of timing of the litigation, there are two additional mesothelioma cases that we expect will be tried this year with more to come in 2024. As with the Barden case, it's important to keep in mind that the ultimate resolution of those matters often is determined at the appellate level, not at the trial level, which is the place which occurs in the forms that the plaintiff lawyers choose. Finally, we will aggressively challenge the abuses of the judicial system by the mass tort plaintiff's bar and its experts with their own affirmative litigation."", ""We mentioned last time that we brought two actions against the plaintiff's bar's lead experts for defaming our TALC products with publications premised unknowingly false propositions. And those are moving forward. They've been fully briefed with respect to the initial case motions and in terms of timing, we expect a ruling shortly from the Federal District Court in New Jersey, whether those matters may proceed to the discovery phase. So that's a quick summary. I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have regarding the strategy."", ""Joe Wolk: Great. Thank you, Eric. Chris, regarding your second question, you know, if J&J had a nickel for every time voracious was quoted back to me since the second quarter earnings, we probably could have taken up guidance even a little bit more. And while that's often associated with wanting or devouring great quantities, I think it's really the second definition in webster's where having a very eager approach to an activity is the construct in which I meant that term in the second quarter. So I could have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, my predecessors could have said that. We routinely, almost weekly meet on new opportunities that may complement our existing portfolio or our future pipeline in both MedTech and Innovative Medicines."", ""And the current moment is no different. In fact, we're in a very good position, given the low levels of net debt, the cash we were able to raise to fulfill one of our capital allocation priorities, which you're probably very, very familiar with at this point in time. But we're not going to compromise our principles in making sure that it's a strategic fit. So it fits into the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities, or the global reach that will add value to that asset in our hands versus someone else. And we're going to make sure that we're disciplined in that approach financially by ensuring that we have a return that's commensal with the risk that we're bearing on behalf of shareholders. So we'd much rather have an okay deal pass us by, then make a bad deal."", ""And that's kind of the principles that we'll live into. There's no deal that's too big, give it our credit rating, as well as our financial strength and annual cash flow generation. But as you know, we've had great success doing smaller, earlier-stage deals as well. We're agnostic with respect to whether it’d be the next one being MedTech or Innovative Medicines, we are simply looking for the best qualified deal that meets both strategic and financial parameters. So hopefully that answers your question. Next question, Kevin?"", 'Operator: Our next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live.', ""Geoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I'll stick with one. So on CARVYKTI, can you talk about the commercial backdrop, just with respect to new centers or prescribers and related on manufacturing? You guys have any update on the vector constraints and maybe when that could be relieved? Thank you so much."", ""Joaquin Duato: Thank you, Geoff. And as you have seen in the progression quarter-over-quarter of CARVYKTI, we continue to have on one hand strong demand and on the other hand, progress in our manufacturing. We're also very encouraged by the data that came out with CARTITUDE-4 that eventually we make CARVYKTI also a medicine in early absence of therapy. So when it comes to our manufacturing progress, I'm going to let John explain what are we doing in order to be able to supply the strong demand that we are seeing in CARVYKTI today. Overall, what you can expect, Geoff, is that we -- you will continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in 2023 into also 2024."", ""John Reed: Yes, to follow up on Joaquin’s comments, we've been progressively adding more and more capacity. That's included at our original launch site in New Jersey, but we're close to having an additional manufacturing site up and rolling in Europe, in Belgium, and also have recently increased our capacity by using some excess capacity that Novartis had to further bolster the number of slots that we can accommodate. One of the traditionally rate-limiting components of the therapy has been the lentivirus component, and there we've made really outstanding progress in-house, mastering that technology, increasing the scale at our factory in Switzerland. And we're in the process -- we're building, I think it will be available next year, another factory in the Netherlands to support the lentivirus component, which has sometimes been one of the rate limiting aspects."", ""So altogether the capacity continues to ramp up and we continue to perfect the technology I would say. Same thing with the number of centers that are qualified to administer the therapy and we're also making progress on the number of countries where CARVYKTI will be available. So very excited, obviously, about the momentum with that. Really, that best-in-class CAR therapy, the CARTITUDE-4 data as you know, showed unprecedented progression-free survival benefit, a hazard ratio of 0.26, overall response rate of 99%, 86% complete response. Very durable for a one and done therapy that was well tolerated. The Grade 3 or above cytokine release syndrome was only 1.1%. So this is really, I think, now emerging as the preferred second line therapy. And we hope to do more such as bringing the front line as a possible alternative to stem cell transplant."", 'Joaquin Duato: And, you know, Geoff, to your point, in multiple myeloma new product launches, we are also very encouraged by the launch of TECVAYLI and also the recent appointment of TALVEY. The progression of these medicines is exceeding our internal expectations and we already have about 2,000 healthcare professionals in the U.S. that are REM certified to be able to administer TECVAYLI and TALVEY. So very encouraging progress in these two medicines in multiple myeloma. And we expect to be able to break out TECVAYLI sales beginning in 2024.', 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.', ""Josh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to ask on STELARA and the biosimilar competition in the U.S. now expected in 2025. That's not new news, but I wanted to check in on how beneficial is the extra year for the innovative medicine and businesses defense strategy. I guess focusing on just the potential for TREMFYA to take share from STELARA and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease indications? And does this time make sure you provide more confidence and potential to hit the constant currency revenue target set for 2025 for the pharma unit? Thanks."", ""Joaquin Duato: Thank you for the question. Certainly we have always been very confident in being able to hit our $57 billion target in 2025 for pharma. As I have explained before, there are a number of factors there, the first one and most important is the growth that we're having in our key assets, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, UPTRAVI, our long-acting injectables, and especially DARZALEX, we continues to have a tremendous trajectory gaining share in first line. We are encouraged, as I just commented, by the launches of CARVYKTI, the progression of SPRAVATO, and also the recent launches too, also in multiple myeloma of TECVAYLI and TALVEY. And looking into 2024, the remainder of the year, and also into 2025, we have some very exciting news in our pipeline."", ""Some of them have been already commented. For example, the first chemo-free regimen as first line in EGFR mutated non-small lung cancer. We will be presenting the data of MARIPOSA in our ESMO and that potentially will be a filing and an approval in 2025. This would be a new standard of therapy in this line of therapy in this very important need for patients. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress in our TARIS drug delivery platform. You are also going to see data being presented at ESMO. Very important for us in two existing products. We will be presenting data on TREMFYA in IBD, both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis for a potential approval later in 2024, that’s going to be a very significant growth driver for TREMFYA, take into consideration that in the STELARA case, IBD represents 75% of the sales."", ""So we still have a lot of growth in front of us with TREMFYA, as we do also in ERLEADA, in which we will present data in localized high-risk prostate cancer. We also, you know, we're also going to be able to present some data of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis end of this year. So all in all, very good news for our pipeline in 2024 and 2025. Certainly, the entrance of the biosimilars in 2025 in the U.S. is another factor that builds our confidence that we are going to be able to meet the $57 billion. For me the most important thing now is to look forward and to think about the growth profile of our innovative medicine group into the second-half of the decade. We have a number of growth drivers that are already there that I described, but also the strength of our pipeline both in immunology, in oncology, and in neuroscience profiles us as a strong company, as a strong growth profile into the second-half of the decade."", ""And that's part of what we will be looking forward to discussing with you in our upcoming enterprise with review, focusing on what is going to be the growth profile in the second-half of the decade."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.', ""Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe Joe, just a little bit more color on 2024. Appreciate the details you provided. Seems like a year of another healthy top line growth. But can you just give us some directional color on margins next year? I know there are some dis-synergies with Kenvue this year. I was trying to get a sense of how you think about margin progression here as you kind of balance some of these, you know, kind of, the pipeline opportunities and some of these top line growth initiatives versus, kind of, dropping that to the bottom line. So if there's any directional color, it would be appreciated. Thanks."", ""Joe Wolk: Yes, sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first off, we're very pleased with the margin progress that we've been able to make in 2023. I think we started the year to roughly flat to now improving by 50 basis points. A lot of that has really gone, is it directly attributable to the efforts of many people in the organization, who really took the opportunity to look at our infrastructure as a two segment company versus a three segment company. So dis-synergies that we warned about and talked about early on in the Kenvue separation process really haven't come to manifest. In fact, as we look out to 2024, we see minimal to almost no impact from dis-synergies from the separation. We are in the process of finalizing our business plans for 2024."", ""I'd like to get a little bit better assessment of how the clinical development pipeline is shaping up, what the investments are required there. But we're a larger company. We take the opportunity to look each and every year at efficiencies. So we're not in a position to give you margin guidance right now, but I would expect that something similar to where we started this year would not be a bad starting point for next year. Again, it's going depend on the investments that the R&D teams from both MedTech and Innovative Medicines can bring forth, and we'll obviously look to accelerate bringing some of these great products to patients sooner if we have that opportunity."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.', ""Larry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, just -- could you just clarify what you meant by flat procedures in ‘24 MedTech? Are you assuming, does that mean flat MedTech growth? And just for my question, can you talk about what you're seeing with bariatrics, if for GLP-1s this is, and how you're thinking about the potential impact of GLP-1s across your device business, you know, long-term, you know, especially in Cardio and Ortho. Thank you."", ""Joe Wolk: So I'll give the second half of that question to Joaquin, but thanks for the clarifying question with respect to market growth. We are not suggesting flat market, or a flat market in MedTech next year. What we do is, are foreseeing right now, based on what we know today, is the elevated levels, the market overall being 5% to 7% versus what traditionally has been maybe 4% to 6%. We see that same 5% to 7% next year. Joaquin?"", 'Joaquin Duato: Thank you, and thank you Larry. And taking a step back, we see the evolution of our MedTech business in a very positive way. One of our key goals for us is to be a top tier grower in MedTech. When I look at the results of MedTech this year, we are delivering on that. Our growth in the quarter pro forma was 6.4% when you compare with Abiomed as a standalone company. And when you look at our pro forma growth year-to-date in MedTech is 7.9%. So very pleased with the performance of our MedTech business. And we have expectations to continue our progression into 2024, in part fueled by the procedural growth that we see and also, but our continued improvement in our execution and the launch of new products. Some of them we can discuss later.', ""For example, you know, we will be launching our first PFA catheter in Europe into 2024. When it comes to GLP-1s, it's good for patients to have new options for treatment, especially in obesity, which at times has been a stigmatized disease in which patients were not looking for treatment due to the stigmatization of that. Certainly, as you commented, we're seeing some impact in our bariatric business in the short-term. Some patients are reconsidering surgery, expecting to get treatment. But overall, when we talk to surgeons, bariatric surgeons, what they see is a complementary role of surgery and GLP-1s, and many of them comment on the fact that they could see a tailwind for bariatric surgery down the road, given this complementary nature, the increased awareness about obesity, more patients seeking treatment, and many of the patients, about 30% of them, are not going to be tolerating this medication."", ""So they would be another funnel for our bariatric business. In the rest of our MedTech business, at this point, we continue to see robust procedure increase and we don't anticipate that change, that thing -- that trend changing in the foreseeable future."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.', ""Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more, John, on Nipocalimab in RA. I know we're going to see the full data here at ACR, but is this a drug that you see potentially working in a broad population or is there a biomarker subset group that's more likely to respond? And then how are you thinking about Phase 3 plans here in this indication? Thank you."", ""John Reed: Yes, thanks for the question and we look forward to sharing those data at the ACR in November in San Diego. We're looking at Nipo as either a monotherapy combined with a precision medicine strategy or as a combination for a broad population where we aim to combine with an anti-TNF agent. We see those two mechanisms as being very complementary, reducing the levels of auto antibodies with Nipo and then inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms with the TNF. The so-called DAISY study, the Phase 2, is underway now and we'll test that combination. So that in general has been the way we're looking at RA, not only for Nipo, but other agents in our pipeline where we see the future being monotherapies that are targeted in a precision medicine way or broad therapies that are combos that can bring together synergistic mechanisms in a safe way."", ""We're excited to be launching the DAISY program to look at that combo. And we're hoping that that will bring deeper, more durable remissions for patients as we bring those new mechanisms together."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is now live.', ""Joanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Is it possible to give us a little bit more detail on a couple of things? You mentioned headwinds from VBP and I'm just curious if there's, A, way to quantify it; and B, a way to say if it's at least better or worse or the same as it has been the last couple of quarters? And then similarly in other aspects of China, we've been hearing a lot about anti-corruption policies, et cetera. If you could comment on that, that would be great. Thank you."", ""Joaquin Duato: Thank you, Joanne. And first, let me say that China for us is a key market, and a market in which we are delivering growth now, and we are going to continue to deliver a strong growth into 2024. So it's a key growth driver for us. So on one hand, certainly, VBP represents a headwind in price. And on the other hand, it also represents an opportunity as you can expand quality products, medical technologies into more patients. So there are a number of MedTech platforms now currently undergoing VBP headwinds, electrophysiology, spine, trauma, endocutters and energy, and these effects will last during 2023 and part of 2024. We have already anniversary our large joins VBP. So at this point, we have about 80% of our platforms that have been already affected by VBP."", ""Again, as we look into 2024, we expect to continue to deliver a strong growth in China, and China remaining a key part of our growth. When it comes to the question that you were asking in anti-corruption side, we have a strong culture of compliance in our business. And at this point, we may see some limitations related to physician and surgeon access, but we are not seeing any material impact in any part of our business due to that, and we'll continue to monitor the situation. Overall, as I said, we continue to see China as a key driver of our growth and also as a key source of innovation moving into the future."", 'Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.', ""Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to maybe dive a little deeper on the immunology side. Appreciate some of the comments you made there already with -- for the quarter, the performance was very strong for several of your products there? So I'm just curious if there were any sort of one-time items there that we should be aware of. It's under like there's a lot of patient mix and market growth that you are commenting on? I'm curious if you can just highlight any sort of stocking or sort of one-time pricing adjustments that we should take into account as we look at future quarters? Thank you."", ""Joaquin Duato: Thank you. We are very pleased with the performance of our immunology business, especially we're pleased with the performance of TREMFYA with 25.1% growth in the quarter, which shows our ability to drive growth there. As I said before, TREMFYA currently is now indicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis as an analog. In the case of STELARA, that represents about 25% of the sales. So with the upcoming readouts, filing and potential approvals of ulcerative colitis and Chron's disease, we expect to have significant growth in TREMFYA. We talk about TREMFYA as a $5 billion product earlier in our Analyst Day in 2021. Now you can see clearly that we're going not only to meet that, but to clearly exceed that benchmark for TREMFYA."", 'So when it comes to STELARA, we had also a very robust growth of close to 16%. In that case, there is a prior period adjustment in the quarter a year ago that represents about 600 basis points. So you should take that into consideration when you think about the STELARA growth. We are very pleased overall, as I said, with our immunology portfolio. Overall, our immunology portfolio in the quarter grew 12.4%, which is very strong considering that we also have headwinds there of REMICADE biosimilars. And we remain very excited about the immunology portfolio as a key driver for J&J. Our Innovative Medicines are going to be bringing significant improvements in IBD with TREMFYA as I recall, but also staying there, we have our target oral peptide which is going to be presenting some data soon that we already presented data in psoriasis.', 'And also, we have the combination of [Technical Difficulty] and golimumab in IBD, which has presented also groundbreaking result, so very encouraged about our immunology portfolio and the ability to drive growth in the second-half of the decade more to be seen in our EBR later in the year.', 'Operator: Thank you.

But b, and probably most importantly, sort of, where you see Ottava ultimately fitting into the robotics landscape and helping contribute to a continued move higher robotics penetration? Thanks so much."", 'Ahmet Tezel: So first of all, thank you for the question. Similar to John, this is my first call as well. So really excited to be here, equally excited to be leading a team of talented scientists, engineers and physicians as we do smarter less invasive and more personalized solutions for our patients. So with respect to Ottava, we have made great progress on the platform. The team is really focused on combining a really differentiated architecture based on its software and hardware together with our best-in-class instruments, and we believe that combination of a differentiated architecture with instruments is going to enable us to have high value from day one.

Unfortunately, with today's therapies, almost all lung cancer patients will eventually relapse. They will need a second line therapy. And we think chemo was best reserved for that circumstance where the patient now has failed the frontline targeted therapies.

I'm proud to present today the company's performance. This is the first quarter that we report as a new J&J, focused in health care innovation, in MedTech and in Pharmaceuticals. And I believe this new J&J has a better foundation to continue to drive growth for the next decade. We are achieving strong results in 2023 with our 7.5% adjusted operational growth in the quarter.

Unfortunately, this is almost never the case. There are at least 250 million people worldwide (including up to 30 million in the US) living with a rare disease, and although 80% of these are genetic or have a genetic component, most will go undiagnosed for years - and some, for a lifetime.', 'This is the frustrating and agonizing journey commonly known as the diagnostic odyssey. In the United States, this odyssey can last up to eight years. It often involves multiple specialists, unnecessary and sometimes invasive testing, and psychological suffering for both the child and their caregivers. Despite guidelines that support genetic testing in this population, less than 8% receive any genetic tests, including the vulnerable children who are cared for in intensive care units.', 'Even when genetic testing is offered, it is frequently low-resolution technologies - such as chromosomal microarray or targeted gene panel tests - that have relatively low rates of diagnosis. Perhaps most problematically, these tests may be ordered serially, with each subsequent test only being ordered after the former is negative, adding complexity, time, and cost to the diagnostic odyssey.', ""What if, early in a patient's journey, their health care provider ordered whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a first-tier test for them, rather than work through an iterative process with traditional genetic tests? What if a child could receive a diagnosis in a few weeks instead of months or years? What if the doctor was able to receive information that otherwise would have completely eluded them?"", 'A 2023 meta-analysis found that on average, 34% of patients received a diagnosis with genome sequencing, and of those patients, on average, 61% experienced a change in clinical management. Changes in management may include therapies that address the underlying cause of the disease, medications that reduce symptoms, surgical options, increased monitoring or, in some instances, the decision to proceed with palliative care.', ""For newborns in intensive care units, a genetic answer can mean the difference between life and death. Features associated with an undiagnosed genetic disease may be subtle or absent in infants. This presents challenges for standard genetic testing, leaving patients at risk of missing a critical window for diagnosis. Recent work by Illumina's scientists, and its collaborators at five sites across the United States, has shown that patients who get access to WGS are twice as likely to have a change in management and are more likely to get the precision care they need to live long and healthy lives."", '""The challenge has changed from ‘Can we do this?\' to ‘How do we do this at scale?\' We want as many patients as possible to have access to this technology, and we need to help doctors and administrators understand that this technology is readily available today,"" says Ryan Taft, PhD, Vice President, Scientific Research at Illumina.

The inverse relationship is primarily due to how investors perceive these assets during times of economic uncertainty.

After our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled for 1 hour. I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""Thanks very much, Shannon, and we want to welcome all of you to our call this evening. Zions Bancorporation recently celebrated the 150th anniversary of its -- what we think of as is ancestral bank, which was Zions Savings Bank and Trust Company, which opened for business in October 18th of '73. I'd like to think that this is a bank that's been built the right way steadily and prudently over many decades with a persistent focus on developing deep roots in the communities we serve and helping customers develop their own strong financial foundations. It's one of the West most prominent pioneer institutions, we look forward to a great future, building on this history and demonstrating a continued commitment to the values that have served us so well over these many years. One other thing that I wanted to comment on before we get into the numbers, during this past quarter, Michael Morris, who has very capably served as our Chief Credit Officer for the past decade retired from the role due to some recent health challenges that led Michael and his family to conclude that he should reduce his workload somewhat.I'm very pleased that Michael will continue with us in a role focused on affordable housing and related projects where I know he'll add a great deal of value. Michael is close and very capable associate over the past decade, Derek Steward has assumed the Chief Credit Officer role. And as Shannon noted, he's with us on the call today, and we welcome Derek into this really important position in the company. So going into the slides. Financial performance for the quarter was marked by sustained stabilization of our net interest margin as well as significant customer deposit growth, both of which have been very encouraging. On Slide 3, you'll see some of the themes that are particularly applicable designs this quarter and these remained fairly consistent with our messaging from the prior quarter. Customer deposits grew $3 billion during the quarter and resulted in reduced reliance on both short-term borrowings and brokered deposits. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet and our hedging in response to changes in our interest rate risk profile. We've had a pretty dynamic and proactive response to changing conditions, and this has contributed to the stabilization of the net interest margin and net interest income. We recognized $14 million in net charge-offs during the quarter, which is in line with the prior quarter. Loss-absorbing capital increase with common equity Tier 1 capital up 7% compared to the prior year. Capital levels remain healthy, particularly of relative to our risk profile. Turning to Slide 4. We've included some key financial performance highlights for the quarter. circled on the slide, we reported total deposit costs of 192 basis points for the quarter compared with 127 basis points in the second quarter. Period end customer deposits increased 5%, broker deposits declined 22%, bringing total deposit growth to 1% quarter-over-quarter. Period end loans were flat for the prior quarter as we observed softening loan demand in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 5, diluted earnings per share was up $0.02 over the second quarter to $1.13 on net income of $168 million as lower expenses offset slightly lower revenue. Turning to Slide 6. Our third quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $272 million, down from $296 million. The linked quarter decline was attributable to lower noninterest revenue while adjusted noninterest expenses were flat. Versus the year ago quarter, PPNR was down 23% as the increase in the cost of funds exceeded the increase in earning asset yields. With that high-level overview, I'm going to ask Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide some additional detail related to our financial performance. Paul?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I will begin with a discussion of the components of pre-provision net revenue. Over the -- over 3/4 of our revenue is from the balance sheet through net interest income. Slide 7 includes our overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart shows the recent 5-quarter trend for both. Net interest income on the bars and the net interest margin in the white boxes were consistent with the prior quarter as the repricing of earning assets nearly kept pace with rising funding costs. Additional detail on changes in the net interest margin is outlined on Slide 8. On the left-hand side of this page, we provided a linked quarter waterfall chart outlining the changes in key components of the net interest margin. The 109 basis point adverse impact associated with deposits including changes in both rate and volume was offset by fewer more expensive borrowed funds and the positive impact of loan repricing. Our success in continuing to grow customer deposits contributed to the reduced level of broker deposits and borrowed funds as we moved through the third quarter. And noninterest-bearing sources of funds continue to serve as a significant contributor to balance sheet profitability. The right-hand chart on this slide shows the net interest margin comparison to the prior quarter. Higher rates were reflected in earning asset yields, which contributed an additional 157 basis points to the net interest margin. This was more than offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs, which when combined with the increased value of noninterest-bearing funding adversely impacted the net interest margin by 189 basis points. Overall, the net interest margin declined by 31 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Our outlook for net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 is stable relative to the third quarter of 2023. Risks and opportunities associated with this outlook include realized loan growth, competition for deposits and the path of interest rates across the yield curve. Moving to noninterest income and revenue on Slide 9. Customer-related noninterest income was $157 million, a decrease of 3% versus the prior year quarter -- sorry, versus the prior quarter due to strong capital market fees in the second quarter. Customer fees were in line with the prior as a year at over year decrease in capital markets was offset by improved treasury management swap fees. Our outlook for customer-related noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 is moderately increasing relative to the third quarter of 2023. The chart on the right side of this page includes adjusted revenue which is the revenue included in adjusted pre-provision net revenue and is used in our efficiency ratio calculation. Adjusted revenue decreased 8% from a year ago and decreased by 3% versus the second quarter due to the factors noted previously and a $13 million gain on the sale of property recognized in the second quarter. Adjusted noninterest expense shown in the lighter blue bars on Slide 10 was essentially flat to the prior quarter at $493 million. Reported expenses at $496 million decreased $12 million due to $13 million in severance expense recognized in the second quarter. Our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense is slightly increasing in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. This outlook excludes any impact associated with the proposed FDIC special assessment, while we have made headway in our effort to flatten expense growth as seen in the current quarter, we expect the time line for fully achieving our expense objectives to take longer than originally planned. Highlighting trends in our average loans and deposits over the past year are on Slide 11. On the left side, you can see that average loans were somewhat flat in the current quarter as loan demand continues to soften, our expectation is that loans will be stable in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Now turning to deposits on the right side of this page. Average deposit balances for the third quarter increased 9%, while ending balances grew 1% compared to the end of the second quarter. Ending customer deposits, which excludes broker deposits, grew 5% in the third quarter. We continue to see deposit growth coming from both existing and new customers. The cost of deposits shown in the white boxes increased during the quarter to 192 basis points from 127 basis points in the prior quarter. As measured against the fourth quarter of 2021, the repricing beta on total deposits based on average deposit rates in the third quarter was 36%, and the repricing beta for interest-bearing deposits was 57%. Slide 12 includes a more comprehensive view of funding sources and total funding cost trends. The left-hand chart includes ending balance trends. Short-term borrowings have decreased $8 billion since the first quarter of 2023 as customer deposits have grown and earning assets have declined. On the right-hand side, average balances for our key funding categories are shown along with the total cost of funding. As seen on this chart, the rate of increase in total funding cost at 22 basis points in the current quarter has notably declined from the first and second quarters. Slide 13 shows noninterest-bearing demand deposit volume trends, although demand deposit volumes have been declining as more customers move into interest-bearing alternatives, a contribution to the net interest margin, and therefore, the value of the demand deposit portfolio continues to increase. Moving to Slide 14. Our investment portfolio exists primarily to be a ready storehouse of funds to absorb customer-driven balance sheet changes. On this slide, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The investment portfolio continues to behave as expected. Principal and prepayment-related cash flows were over $800 million in the third quarter. With this somewhat predictable portfolio of cash flow, we anticipate that money market and investment securities balances combined will continue to decline over the near term, which will be a source of funds for the balance sheet. The duration of the investment portfolio, which is a measure of price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, is slightly shorter compared to the prior year period, estimated at 3.5% currently versus 3.9% 1 year ago. This duration helps to manage the inherent interest rate risk mismatch between loans and deposits. With the larger deposit portfolio assumed to have a longer duration than our loan portfolio, fixed rate term investments are required to bring balance to assets and liability duration. Slide 15 provides information about our interest rate sensitivity, a comparison of our modeled depositor behavior to recently observed depositor behavior suggests shortened deposit durations. This change in assumption reduces modeled asset sensitivity, which we are showing on this page with the bars labeled adjusted deposit assumptions. In light of this change, we are actively managing our asset duration to the emerging liability duration. During the third quarter, we added an additional $1 billion of pay fixed interest rate swaps. As a reminder, the $3.5 billion of portfolio level pay fixed swaps on our books serve to hedge the value of our investment portfolio designated as available for sale in a rising rate environment. On the right-hand side of this slide, we've included detail on the impact current and implied rates are expected to have on net interest income. As a reminder, we have been using the terms latent interest rate sensitivity and emergent interest rate sensitivity to describe the effects on net interest income of rate changes that have occurred, but have not yet fully been reflected in the repricing of our financial instruments as well as those expected to occur as implied by the shape of the yield curve. Importantly, earning assets are assumed to remain unchanged in size or composition in these descriptions. These estimates utilize the adjusted deposit assumptions described earlier. Regarding latent sensitivity, the in-place yield curve as of September 30 will work through our net interest income over time. Assuming a funding cost beta based on recent history, we would expect net interest income to decline approximately 2% in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Regarding emergent sensitivity, if the September 30, 2023, forward path of interest rates materializes, the emergent sensitivity measure is estimated to be immaterial in the third quarter of '24 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. As noted previously, our outlook for net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 relative to the third quarter of 2023 is stable as we expect balance sheet composition changes to be accretive to net interest income. Moving to Slide 16. Credit quality remained strong. Classified loan levels remaining stable and low. Nonperforming assets increased $64 million due primarily to 2 suburban office loans in the Southern California market, which added $46 million and 1 C&I loan, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs were 10 basis points of loans for the quarter. Loan losses in the quarter were associated with borrowers that have struggled with idiosyncratic supply chain issues, $3 million in losses on 2 office loans and other small losses distributed throughout the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is 1.30% of loans, a 5 basis point increase over the prior quarter due largely to increases in reserves for the CRE office portfolio. As we know as a topic of interest, we have included information regarding the commercial real estate portfolio with additional detail included in the appendix of this presentation. Slide 17 is a reminder of the discipline we have maintained over the last decade as it relates to commercial real estate in the context of credit concentration risk management. Our growth has remained well below peers over this time. Slide 18 provides an overview of the CRE portfolio. CRE represents 23% of our loan portfolio with office representing 16% of total CRE or 4% of total loan balances. Credit quality measures for the total CRE portfolio remained relatively strong, though nonperforming assets increased in the quarter to 2.3% of the office portfolio. As mentioned, we recognized $3 million in losses on 2 office loans in the quarter across the CRE office portfolio. Overall, we continue to expect the CRE portfolio to perform well with limited losses based on the current economic outlook. Our loss absorbing capital position is shown on Slide 19. The CET1 ratio continued to grow in the third quarter to 10.2%. This, when combined with the allowance for credit losses, compares well to our risk profile as reflected in the low level of ongoing loan net charge-offs. As the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we would not expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We expect to maintain strong levels of regulatory capital while managing to a below-average risk profile. Slide 20 summarizes the financial outlook provided over the course of this presentation. As a reminder, this outlook represents our best current estimate for the financial performance in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the actual results reported in the third quarter of 2023. The quarters in between are subject to seasonality."", 'Shannon R. Drage', 'This concludes our prepared remarks. As we move to the question-and-answer section of the call, we request that you limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions. Alicia, please open the line for questions.', 'Operator', 'We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""I wanted to ask about NII. When you look at the NII monthly data that you provided earlier in September versus what you have here for the full quarter. It looks like NII declined in September. So just wondering if you could talk about what drove that and how you're thinking about the parts of NII between now and the stable outlook you outlined for 3Q '24?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Sure. I'll start. This is Paul. So the purpose of the monthly net interest income that we provided in both the second and the third quarter, was meant to provide some inter-quarter guidance, which we don't typically do on the sort of level of where net interest income and the net interest margin was coming out. And so you may recall at the end of the second quarter -- during the second quarter call in July, we stated that we expected the net interest margin to begin to stabilize in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter after seeing several quarters of net interest margin decline. And that net interest income outlook was meant to sort of support that. I wouldn't read too much into monthly net interest income figures. I think that, that can get a little squirrely. I would rely on our overall outlook, which is that as we look ahead over the course of next year, we expect our net interest income to be approximately flat in the third quarter of '24 when compared to the third quarter of '23. And so Harris, do you like to add to that?"", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""Well, yes, I think there's also one fewer day in the month versus August. I mean you'll get a little fluctuation things like that as well."", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. Thank you. So that's kind of my purpose of my statement saying that it's hard to read into any given month."", 'Manan Gosalia', ""Okay. I appreciate that. And just as we think through the trajectory for NII over the next year, in a higher for longer rate environment, I know you do get a benefit from utilizing the securities paydowns as well as the loans repricing but given the pressure on the deposit side, should we think about just NIM and NII may be coming down a little bit in the near term and starting to move up as we get closer to 3Q '24? Or maybe you can help us with the trajectory there."", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Sure. I'll tell you how I'm thinking about it. And that is that our -- as the yield curve has steepened if we had continued steepening that is kind of flattening from inverted flat here over the last several months, particularly in the last couple of weeks. The -- our earning assets are continuing to reprice. And so the earning asset pickup, if you will, I expect it to be in the sort of range of 5 to 10 basis points a quarter over the next couple of quarters. You also saw our funding costs and the increase in our funding costs begin to really flatten out in the third quarter when compared to the prior 2 quarters. My expectation, therefore, is that the improvement in earning assets will keep pace with -- will keep pace with the change in funding costs such that my expectation is that the net interest margin will be -- would not decline much from here, consistent with the outlook we provided in the second quarter. Again, as I think about our earning asset and liability repricing it feels like based on the current rate outlook that we've hit a spot where I'm expecting net interest income to flatten from here, as we say in the outlook. And then the opportunity for improvement will be really largely predicated on our ability to actively manage those deposit rates."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point.', 'David Patrick Rochester', ""Just back on the NII guide. What are you guys factoring in for deposit flows and the beta and the bottom for the DDA mix and the timing of that, if you've got any thoughts around your base case there?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. On -- I don't have the slide number in front of me. But in the interest sensitivity slide in the materials, you'll see that we actually provided an expectation of continued increase in deposit rates. On Slide 15 of the earnings materials. You can see there in the latent sensitivity that outlook, that kind of minus 2% outlook in latent sensitivity provides a total deposit beta of 50%. kind of accumulating over time throughout the next year. That is say, if interest rates stop rising, we are continuing, we're expecting in that outlook for deposit rates to continue increasing marginally."", 'David Patrick Rochester', 'And in terms of DDA mix, where do you think that bottoms and when? That would be great.', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes, that's a little more difficult to predict. But what I will say is that sort of all-in funding beta includes further migration of noninterest-bearing demand into interest-bearing deposits. So therefore, my expectation is that we will continue to see some DDA migration, but that's all incorporated into our outlook."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', ""Good afternoon. John, I just -- actually, I wanted to ask a question on the loan growth front, believe it or not. It looks like the, I know your loan growth outlook is stable. I wondered if there could be upside to that. We're seeing some other banks that are below the $100 billion Basel III threshold that they're able to -- acknowledging you're able to step up and gain some share as some of the bigger banks are all busy with their RWA diets and balance sheet optimization. So I mean, would you think that maybe there could be an opportunity to pick up some quality loan growth here that you otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity to or opportunity to gain share and perhaps that loan growth outlook might be a bit conservative?"", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""John, I'll jump in. It's Harris. I've always believed loan growth is the trickiest thing possible to try and forecast because it's so dependent on payoffs and rate and everything else. But I -- there may be some. I don't think we may even have some differences of opinions around the table about where we think loan growth is headed. I think none of us think it's going to be, that we're going to see anything much, but there could be some. We also just note that during the third quarter, it was pretty weak. I think it's -- I mean, very recently, we've seen a little bit of pickup, but it's -- you can't make much out of a very short period of time in terms of trying to extrapolate that very far. So I think that's why we've got it kind of stable. It probably represents kind of the, mean of where we're all kind of prognosticating around here."", 'Scott J. McLean', ""This is Scott. I would just add to that, that I think whatever pulling back the global banks are doing, I don't know that it's producing a granular sort of benefit in the marketplace. And particularly when you think about the size of our clients and the size of their books to the extent they're pulling back on really large commitments that is not necessarily where we play. But, yes. I would just say to Harris's comment, I think our loan flatness right now is more indicative of just the customer base and being cautious and compared to where they were 2, 3, 4 quarters ago when we were seeing historic loan growth coming out of the pandemic."", 'John G. Pancari', 'Yes. No, I got it. Understood. And then lastly, I know the -- I indicated, I think, Paul, you indicated in the prepared remarks, the expense objectives are taking longer than originally planned to execute. Could you just talk about that or what has taken longer in terms of any expense rationalization efforts. And maybe if you could tie into that as the core system upgrade, is that at all impacting that?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Scott and Harris to supplement that. So you saw us take a severance charge in the second quarter. The run rate improvement associated that -- with that, I would expect to occur kind of in the fourth to first quarter. But when I speak to sort of taking longer than expected, what I'm speaking about is the inflation headwinds. We're seeing that across the board in contracts and other things. And so as we continue to fight expenses, we're actively working those expenses down. But the tide inflation, I hope, is turning the corner, but the sort of inflation tide isn't out yet. And we just continue to fight that. And it's the reality of the environment that we're all dealing with today."", 'Scott J. McLean', ""I would just add to that, that the -- the other thing we're seeing is that the inflation in 2022, even though it's softened a little bit this year. In terms of major technology vendors and their renewals and extensions of contracts, we're seeing probably the most vigorous rate pass-throughs that we've seen in years. And I think it's symptomatic of the fact that the inflation occurred last year, things renewing this year and going into '24, quite a bit of pressure on those kind of baseline technology vendors."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""They've all been watching Hulu and Disney+, I think."", 'Scott J. McLean', ""And on our core transformation project, I would just say that and we have commented for years that when we go live with the final deposits release, which we did go live with a pilot, one of our affiliates in the second quarter that during this period, it will take us 12 months to fully convert all of our affiliates. And during that conversion period just because of the way the accounting works, our P&L impact will get worse by about $10 million to $15 million. And then in the following year, the following 12 months after that, they drop by a commensurate amount. So there's a little bit of a timing issue related to actually the period we're going live in."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW.', 'Christopher Edward McGratty', ""Great. Paul, maybe we could come back to the deposit beta slide, Slide 15. I just want to make sure I fully understand. I'm comparing your assumed full-cycle beta last quarter of 40 to the new 50 and I'm trying to reconcile the 70 basis points of additional deposit pressure from here if the -- so I guess if the Fed is done, why would you see that big of an increase in deposit costs from here?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. So there's 2 things going on there. As I said, there's sort of the lagging effect of deposit rates. Again, this is what we're assuming in the model. I'm hopeful that we can do a little bit better than this. But based on recent history, our expectation is that there are some interest-bearing products will continue to float up. But another big part of that is an assumption of continued migration of noninterest-bearing demand into interest-bearing. That sort of, we don't normally think of that as beta, but it has the practical or economic effect of a repricing beta. And so all of those things combined into that 70 basis points."", 'Christopher Edward McGratty', ""Okay. Maybe separately, I think John asked about the growth opportunity under 100. I mean, you're about 10% or 15% under the 100 threshold. I'm interested in the cost that you're beginning to budget. I think one of your peers said it's $100 million a year from crossing. You have a time to remix and stay under. But how are you thinking about the costs to ultimately go over 100."", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. So I'll start with that and invite Harris and Scott to jump in. Recall, we were a CCAR bank a few years ago and sort of all of the muscular activity that we put in place to be compliant with CCAR and being a SIFI and all those things, that's all still in place. I mean there were really -- we put in some really great risk management things that continue to be in place. So I don't foresee personally anywhere close to $100 million of incremental costs. In fact, I think that we sort of have the things in place today to be able to comply. The biggest change for us, I think there will be some changes in risk-weighted assets around the edges that we need to pay attention to. But the biggest change for us will be the incorporation of AOCI into the numerator. And as I think we've previously stated, the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio, which is the source of our -- the source of the AOCI that we have on the balance sheet, we expect to be large -- that impact we expect to be largely gone by the time that those rules become effective for us."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""I guess I just -- I think that's very true with respect to capital. I think the one place it's going to cost us on the debt requirement. And we've got about $0.5 billion of debt if you put the proposed debt requirement into place today, that would go up to about $4 billion roughly. So that incremental $3.5 billion, the credit spread on that relative to the cost of funding, with either wholesale, any other wholesale source home loan, larger deposits, et cetera, is going to create some drag, I think. And on that you kind of do the math, whatever you think that credit spread is on times our risk-weighted asset number. So that, I think, to me, is going to be the primary sort of new thing that we'll hit."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist Securities.', 'Brandon King', ""So with expectation of stable loans over the next 12 months and the runoff of the securities book, what's the outlook for deposit growth?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, yes, we historically have stayed away from deposit growth outlook. I think what you've seen, though, over the last couple of quarters is substantial deposit growth as we -- our continued conversations with our customers have paid off in the form of increased deposits on the balance sheet. Deposit growth has been very good over the last 2 quarters. And then the third quarter, in particular, I wouldn't expect that level of deposit growth to continue. But I do expect, I do expect Zions to be able to maintain a very solid loan-to-deposit ratio and continue to see deposit growth probably at least into the next quarter."", 'Brandon King', 'Okay. And within that, is there a meaningful delta between the rate of new customer deposits versus existing customers?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. The deposit growth that we've seen in the third quarter has definitely been on the higher end of our deposit sort of offering rates -- and so you see that in the continued increase in the interest-bearing deposit rate, that's largely coming from the new money coming on the balance sheet at higher rates."", 'Brandon King', ""Okay. So it's more of that and as far as existing customers, bringing back funds and mix shifting into higher interest-bearing accounts."", 'Scott J. McLean', ""Yes, this is Scott. I would say that what we've seen is that as we became much more active in our pricing of interest-bearing deposits that we -- our clients have become much more active in bringing their deposits back. So we -- as we've said, we had approximately $11 billion in deposits off balance sheet [as that] client deposits that were in off-balance sheet money market funds because we just -- the industry was washed with liquidity. And as we started continuing to talk to those clients about bringing those deposits back on balance sheet. It was very easy conversation. And we got more aggressive about what we were paying. They're not only bringing back what they had in our off-balance sheet money market sweeps, but they're bringing other deposits they've had in other institutions in meaningful amounts. So I wouldn't so much say that the growth has come from new customers as much as it has come from existing customers that just have a lot of deposits that were not on our balance sheet going into this year. Got it."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brody Preston with UBS.', 'Broderick Dyer Preston', ""I wanted just to follow up on the fixed asset repricing commentary. If I heard you correctly, I think you said it was 5 to 10 basis points a quarter positive to the earning asset yield over the next couple. I was hoping you could maybe unpack that a little bit for us and say what are the assumptions driving that? Like what's the amount of loans that are repricing over the next 12 months? And what's the back book yield that's coming off versus new origination yields?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. I'm going to answer that slightly differently than the way you asked it. And that is to say that we've got a really sophisticated balance sheet simulation tool where we are sort of analyzing our loans and securities on a note by note or [indiscernible] basis. We put in the forward curve and then we turn all of that around. And as we look at those model results here for the next 5 -- next couple of quarters, what we see is that the earning asset yield in the aggregate. So that's investment portfolio, sort of cash flow out of investments, any repricing of cash. And then in addition to the loans, which would be, generally speaking, longer resets that are resetting to the now prevailing higher rates. All of those things combined are creating an accretion in the yield of earning assets in the range of 5 to 10 basis points over the course of the next couple of quarters."", 'Broderick Dyer Preston', ""Okay. Understood. And then I wanted to switch gears to credit. I had a couple of generic questions and it was a little bit more pointed. Just I was hoping you could tell us what portion of the loan portfolio were shared national credits? And of that, what you'd lead on? And then I also wanted to ask on the nonperforming assets, they increased $68 million, and you called out it was due to 2 suburban office loans. I wanted to ask what geographies those were in and what drove those to nonperforming."", 'Derek Steward', ""This is Derek. So let me start with the second part of the question first with the 2 office loans in question were actually in California, the Southern California. And they just -- or had leasing lease rollover issues, and they were actually value-add properties where they weren't able to retenant as fast as the sponsor was hoping for."", 'Broderick Dyer Preston', 'Got it. Do you have the Shared National Credit data?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""I think on SNCs, if you don't mind, Derek, I think on SNC, the total shared national credits portion of the loan portfolio is in the range of 10% to 15%. And I don't have the sort of number of agents in versus nonagents deal on that. But that's sort of the ballpark in our portfolio."", 'Scott J. McLean', ""Yes. We agent about 10% of -- 10% to 15% of what we participate in. The rest were in terms of stakes and then we're a participant in the others. It's also a very balanced portfolio. It's very diverse. And -- the portfolio has performed well for us over the years."", 'Broderick Dyer Preston', 'Okay. Just to clarify, was it 10% to 15% of the portfolio is SNC. And of that 10% to 15% you agent?', 'Scott J. McLean', 'Yes.', 'Broderick Dyer Preston', 'Okay. And just if I could sneak one more, just on the retenanting of some of those office loans...', 'Scott J. McLean', ""Yes, the other thing you need to understand too is that somewhere in the range of 90% to 95% of these customers are in our footprint. They're not out of footprint transactions. And in those where we are not the agent in almost all cases, we have ancillary business. So these are clients that we know in our markets. This is not buying paper outside of our markets."", 'Broderick Dyer Preston', ""Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Could I just ask one last one on those office loans with the retenanting, did the slow kind of re-tenanting process caused like the debt service coverage ratio to go below 1 or anything like that?"", 'Scott J. McLean', 'Yes. It did.', 'Broderick Dyer Preston', 'Okay. I appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.', 'Shannon R. Drage', 'Thank you, Alicia, and thank you to all for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please contact us on the e-mail or phone number listed on our website. We look forward to connecting with you throughout the coming months.

This is the lower number here. It's up by 4.7%. And this is after that company came out, not just with earnings, but also said it was authorizing a $2 billion buyback program here. That really seems to have caught investors' attention here."", ""At the same time, it's adjusted property EBITDA came out ahead of what analysts had been anticipating as well.

Wells Fargo's management is proactive in addressing potential credit losses."", ""For instance, in the second quarter, Wells Fargo increased its allowance for credit losses by $949 million. This increase was primarily driven by two key factors: the office portfolio and the growth in the credit card portfolio. While there have been no significant losses in the office portfolio, the bank's comprehensive, loan-by-loan review has provided valuable insights into the potential trajectory of credit quality over the coming quarters. The detailed approach demonstrates the bank's dedication to understanding and mitigating risks at a granular level."", ""It is important to note that assessing credit risk is not as simple as relying on a single statistic. Instead, it requires a multifaceted evaluation, taking into account various factors, including property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice dates, loan structure and borrower behavior.

Additionally, a 9% year-over-year increase in mobile logins signifies the sustained growth in digital customer engagement."", ""A standout example of Wells Fargo's customer-centric approach is the introduction of Fargo, an AI-powered virtual assistant on its mobile app for consumer customers. Since its launch in April, customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times."", ""Wells Fargo's capital position is a key strength that allows the bank to pursue its strategic objectives. With a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 10.7%, the company has ample capital to withstand economic shocks and invest in growth opportunities."", ""This strength is particularly significant in the context of the asset cap, as the bank's balance sheet can support growth without significantly expanding its exposure. By continuing to invest in strategic areas like wealth management and investment banking, Wells Fargo may capture market opportunities and drive growth."", ""Finally, Wells Fargo's strong fundamentals also manifest in its net interest income.

Economists expected that as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat inflation, it would result in reduced consumer and business spending, job cuts, and the potential for unemployment to increase, possibly reaching 7% or more, double its level when the Fed began tightening credit.', 'Contrary to expectations, as interest rates have increased, inflation has dropped from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.7%, and the unemployment rate has remained low at 3.8% since March 2022. This situation has raised the possibility of a rare and challenging ""soft landing,"" where inflation is controlled without causing a severe recession.', 'Several factors have contributed to this positive state of employment in the US, like consumer savings, and business adaptability. As the US economy continues to navigate these dynamics, it remains to be seen how long this resilience will persist, especially as the Federal Reserve intends to maintain high-interest rates into 2024.', 'Tech corporations, on the other hand, have laid off a huge number of employees amid inflationary pressures. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has initiated another round of layoffs for its recruiting division, with plans to let go of hundreds of recruiters.

As of June 30, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) employed 181,798 people, and the company has been striving to offset the high costs of its AI investments through strategic cost management."", 'It is worth highlighting how its cost management and prioritization of AI has been appreciated as Oakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet reported multiple strong sets of earnings releases over the past year, and its results generally exceeded consensus estimates across key metrics. Most recently, search revenue growth accelerated from 5% to 6.5% sequentially in the second quarter, a notable development given lingering economic uncertainty and broader advertising weakness. Cloud growth remained at 30%, stable versus the previous quarter, despite continued headwinds from customers optimizing cloud usage. Margin progression also continued, and cloud margins reached 5%. CFO Ruth Porat emphasized that the largest impact of the company’s cost[1]saving initiatives will not be felt until 2024. YouTube continues to prioritize its Shorts segment, which is experiencing strong viewership growth. Although this is a near-term revenue headwind, we believe Shorts’ monetization will accelerate over time. Addressing the year’s hottest topic, CEO Sundar Pichai said Alphabet is an “AI-first company” that is “extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point.” At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, it showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools to be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the company’s impressive innovations in AI technologies. Overall, we believe the company is positioned well to reap the benefits of the scale of its search business and years of its investment into AI capabilities. We also appreciate that the company is undergoing a transformation on how it views cost discipline and efficiency.”', 'On the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is set to freeze its hiring activities as the CEO expects AI replacing approximately 7,800 jobs within the company.

This comes as General Motors (GM) announced it will be delaying the production expansion of its Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV at its Orion Assembly plant by a year."", ""Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and Rachelle Akuffo discuss BYD's results and the mixed EV picture. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Well, we are watching shares of Chinese EV maker BYD pop after the company said it expects its third quarter net profit to almost double, driven by record sales despite increased competition and a slowdown in the Chinese consumer. This news comes from BYD as GM announces it's delaying the production of its electric trucks and a Michigan plant by at least one year, citing slow adoption rates. So we are seeing a mixed picture here from electric vehicle makers."", ""Rachelle, the BYD story is certainly a very interesting one. Impressive if, in fact, we do see those record sales in the quarter, given just how aggressive not just BYD but Tesla and other EV makers have been in the quarter in their pricing to try and attract more consumers at a time when we have seen a bit of a pullback among those consumers. You know, a company like BYD increasingly, yes, China is the largest EV market, but increasingly going to have to look outside. Europe is one they've really honed in on as they expand their footprint there to 15 countries."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: It\'s true, because when you look at some of the price points for BYD, their cheapest EV starting at about $10,000, making it very competitive, but as you mentioned, not available in all markets. Their most expensive one, their higher end, one starting at about $150,000. But what BYD does have the edge in the ability to ramp up production. They\'re opening even more plants, production plants, in China, and even regarding to the success, BYD credited this quarter\'s success to, quote, ""Leveraging on its improving brand influence, continuously expanding scale advantage, and strong industrial chain-wide cost control capacity, demonstrating strong resilience.""', ""And so when you have as many models as BYD already has, when you compare it to Tesla, these are the top two EV makers in the world. Tesla still ahead, but BYD has been closing that gap steadily. But they did get into that-- sort of that tete a tete battle when Tesla started making those price cuts, which did also cut into BYD's bottom line, but because they do have that range of products available, it did still put them in a very good position, and they're looking very positive here. I mean, they've been trying to keep up with those price cuts. Tesla still leading, though, in EV sales globally, but, you know, BYD catching up slowly."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, one of the big benefits for BYD is that vertical integration we talk about a lot. They do control their own supply chain, whether it's the batteries or other parts, so that allows them to control the costs a little more. That's not something that Tesla has, but we talk about GM as well. It is something they are trying to build out as well with their battery factories too, but certainly the company looking kind of in a different outlook here, at least among some of these EV trucks that they've talked about."", ""Higher price points for sure, and, Rachelle, you know, I keep wondering, this is the question that's asked within the EV market, I realize we're talking about a global market, but where is that next lever? Is it from sort of the sedans? Is it from the SUVs and the trucks that we have seen increasingly being pursued, at least in the North American market? Something still to be determined, I guess, because there's still a lot of market there to capture when you consider, what is it, roughly 10% right now of the overall--"", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: --auto market?', ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And people-- I think people still want a better price point. Not everyone can afford a Tesla. Even with these new price cuts that Tesla has, people still-- you know, if they're going to dip their toe in the EV market, they want the infrastructure there and they want the pricing to make sense.""]"

Please refer to the related definitions and reconciliations in our press release.

Joining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are our Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby; President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Leskinen. In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&A. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Scott.', 'Scott Kirby: Thank you, Kristina. I want to start today by saying how heartbroken we are by the horrific attacks on Israel and the escalating conflict in the region that has millions of innocent people in harm’s way. Here at United when tragedy strikes anywhere around the world, we focus first on safety and second on how we can use our unique capabilities to help. While we suspended our service to Tel Aviv, we were the first U.S. carrier to add extra flights to Athens where customers connect from airlines operating between Tel Aviv and Athens. We also upgauged some regularly scheduled flights to Athens, added a dedicated Tel Aviv support desk and continued flying to Oman and Dubai to maximize flexibility for our customers with tickets to Tel Aviv.', 'We’re closely monitoring the situation on the ground and staying in close touch with State Department officials so that we can resume service as soon as possible. We look forward to cessation of violence in the region, and as we’ve done in the past crises around the globe, we expect United to continue to play a meaningful role in the humanitarian response. Turning back to the business, I want to start by welcoming Mike to the leadership team. You all know him well, but I’m excited to have him as a partner who agrees with my no excuses approach, who is a 100% committed to making United work for our employees, customers and shareholders. I also want to congratulate Kristina for her recent announcement as a -- from Crain’s here in Chicago as one of the top 40 Under 40.', 'The third quarter was another solid milestone to demonstrate that United Next is working as we expected, and the growth we are adding is profitable. Though fuel spiked this quarter, we’re very encouraged about our results. It’s clear to see why from the numbers. Our top line revenue grew 12.5% to $14.5 billion, making it the highest third quarter in our history. Our costs were also on track with our plans as we delivered strong operations in both August and September. United’s diverse revenue streams have also allowed us to handle variations in demand and produce solid, absolute, and even better relative results. It’s evident in the numbers. United and one other airline expected to count for 98% of the total industry revenue growth this quarter, and over 90% of the industry’s total pre-tax profitability.', 'Even in a tough industry environment, United’s diverse model is building strong, absolute, and even more impressive relative margins. So, what is it about revenue diversity that makes us different? First, because of our size and industry leading global network, our loyalty program is the most attractive program in the world for customers, and therefore generates significantly directly earned EBIT, significant loyalty, but also significant opportunity to do even more with it in the future. Expect to hear a lot more details from us on this front, starting at an investor day in early 2024. Second, we have unmatched geographic diversity with the largest domestic network complemented by the largest long-haul international network, and both are solidly profitable.', 'While this is a great attribute, it does create some short-term risk and volatility as we’re seeing right now with the transitory hit to margins this quarter, as a result of the tragedy in Israel. Third, we feel that both business travelers, it’s been nice to see recent momentum in that segment, but also increasingly the leisure customers as well. We’ve gotten a lot more agile at pivoting capacity in the leisure markets and not surprisingly have found that our core customers can now fly us in both business and leisure markets as we add seats to leisure destinations. Our ability to move domestic capacity in the leisure markets when they’re strong is a consequential driver of our strong relative revenue performance. And fourth, we continue to advance and improve our segmentation efforts.', 'This is a project almost a decade in the making, but all the way from Basic Economy, which just allows us to compete profitably on price on the low end and all the way up to Polaris on long-haul international, United is able to give our customers the real choice they want. So, what does that mean going forward? In short, it’s a confirmation that United Next is working as we expected. We thought the industry operating environment would be difficult. We thought that medium term capacity aspirations would be higher than demand growth. We thought that domestic would be a lot tougher than international, in the short to medium-term. But we also thought United would win share, grow our gauge and grow our connectivity, and that would allow United specifically to improve our results.', 'By the way, we also expected and now believe it’ll happen even faster, that the domestic market is going to see a shakeout that leads to an improvement in margins over the medium to long-term. It’s impossible to call the timing exactly, but I guess that we see meaningful industry changes by 2H ‘24. And for what it’s worth, that’s what has happened every single time we’ve been through one of the cycles in my career. And as that is happening, I’ll continue closely tracking the airline industry revenue to GDP relationship. I’ve talked about this in the past. That ratio declined by approximately 35% in the past few decades. I don’t think we’ll make all that up, but almost everything we do make up goes straight to the bottom-line.', 'So, in conclusion, I’m proud of the team at United. We’re creating something special here. Even in a tough industry environment, we’re producing strong absolute results while producing the best relative results in our history. We believe we have a lot of runway ahead of us with United Next in our diverse revenue streams, along with our ability to catch up on gauge and connectivity positioning United well. We expect that the current stress in segments of the industry is also going to lead to structural changes that lay the foundation for an even better future for United, our employees, our customers, and our shareholders. With that, I’ll turn it over to Brett.', 'Brett Hart: Thank you, Scott. And thank you to each member of the United team. Your dedication is what continues to propel us to the top. I also want to acknowledge the tragic conflict in Israel. At United, our top priority is the safety of our crews and customers. We are closely monitoring the situation. Following our coordination with the State Department, we have suspended flights to Tel Aviv till the end of October, and we are offering waivers to impacted customers. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust as needed. Mike will provide more detail on the impact of these capacity adjustments shortly. Last quarter, we announced changes to our operation at Newark to better hedge against disruptions, including taking advantage of FAA granted waivers to reduce our flight schedule along with the necessary airspace relief in the highly congested region.', 'While July was a difficult weather month, the Newark waivers and other proactive measures to improve reliability helped avoid pre-pandemic levels of ATC-related delays. In the third quarter, delayed arrivals were down 16 points versus the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, in August, we had the fewest cancels of any August in history, while operating the third largest quarter widebody schedule effort. In September, the FAA granted extensions to the New York airspace waivers, allowing the ability to maintain a reduced flight schedule at Newark that will help minimize air traffic delays through the rest of the year. The flexibility enabled by waivers are proving to be successful in ensuring operational reliability and resiliency at our largest international hub and have meaningfully improved the travel experience for our customers traveling in and out of Newark and throughout our network.', 'Looking to our system operations. During the quarter, we carried over 482,000 revenue passengers daily, the most in any quarter in United’s history with top-tier system customer D:00 in August and September. We’re grateful to the FAA for allowing us to make necessary adjustments in Newark and thank our employees who worked hard to get our customers to their destinations safely and on time. While most of our network has recovered to 2019 capacity levels or beyond, our China network has been last to recover. At the start of the quarter, we were operating four flights a week from San Francisco to Shanghai. And this month, we increased that to a daily flight. Next month, we will be the first U.S. airline to return to Beijing with a daily flight from San Francisco.', 'We believe this measured approach to bringing China capacity back on line is appropriate as demand slowly recovers. These increased flights are a significant step forward in rebuilding our Asia Pacific network. Late last month, our pilots ratified their industry-leading agreement. This contract enables us to continue providing great career opportunities in United, and I’m excited for the future as we continue to execute our United Next plan. At this point, we ratified agreements for four out of our five major work groups. Flight attendants represented by AFA are in active negotiations, and we look forward to sharing an update when we have one. As a reminder, we began accruing for pilot pay rate increases in the first quarter of this year.', 'Our outlook has and continues to represent our expectation for this agreement. And with that, I will hand it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue environment.', 'Andrew Nocella: Thanks, Brett. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 12.5%, 1 point ahead of our guidance midpoint. TRASM was down 2.8%, PRASM was down 1% and capacity increased 15.7% year-over-year. Capacity came in a bit below our original outlook, mostly due to the changes in our Hawaii flying levels in response to the fires. It’s nice to come in ahead of our revenue outlook as the strong Q3 outcome further validates that our United Next commercial strategies are working well and that we have differentiated United from our competition. Demand for the Atlantic and the Pacific was truly outstanding, and we see that trend continuing into the fourth quarter. Third quarter domestic PRASM results were consistent with our year-over-year performance in the second quarter of down 2.1 points.', 'In other words, we saw no real change in our domestic trends in the quarter-over-quarter review. Our focus on prudent gauge growth centered in our hubs resulted in strong positive marginal revenue on our incremental capacity. We did focus a majority of our third quarter growth on international flying. International capacity increased 22%. International PRASM was up 1.3% year-over-year. International profit margins remain well ahead of domestic, though domestic margins remain solidly profitable. We also saw strong performance across most of the globe. Clearly, Europe was a standout with capacity being up 12% and with positive PRASM performance. Asia Pacific led international PRASM up 3.8% on 86% more capacity. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter.', 'We expect total revenue to be up approximately 10.5% on approximately 15.5% more capacity. This implies TRASM will be down around 4.5% year-over-year. Our guide assumes we begin limited service to Tel Aviv again in November. Tel Aviv accounts for approximately 2% of United’s consolidated capacity. As we think about the sequential trend in unit revenues, I know many of you are wondering if we are seeing a slowdown. Resurgence of the Pacific flying is resulting in many long-haul flights being added, increasing United’s long-haul international scheduling by 5 points versus Q3. United’s Q4 unit revenue expectations are consistent with Q3 adjusted for stage. United has taken full advantage of the demand surge across the Pacific with capacity being added to key markets, including the long pending resumption of daily flights to Beijing and Shanghai from San Francisco and the addition of Manila, just to name a few.', 'Having done capacity plan in my entire career, I haven’t said that our team is the best in the business. United properly allocated our 2023 growth to international markets over domestic and in domestic markets, we wisely invested in gauge, not scope or depth. Less than 1% of United’s domestic capacity this winter is in new markets, not in 2019. Capacity planning for 2024 will be even more important to achieve our financial goals. While we’re not going to provide guidance for 2024 today, we have plans to let the 30% growth we’ve added to the Atlantic since 2019 mature in 2024 and expect to fly at similar level of capacity in ‘24 as ‘23. We also plan on little to no growth for the first half of next year on domestic flying. This preview of our 2024 capacity, I think, will allow United to continue to produce top-tier results as we align with industry conditions.', 'I wanted to touch on a few other important commercial elements today as well. Recently, the question I get asked the most often by our frequent flyers is about potential changes to achieve premier status on United. The good news is we have no material changes planned for 2025 program year. We’ve carefully managed our premier population in recent years to maintain a robust and valuable set of benefits for each premier member. We very much believe in never causing a situation where everyone has a premier status which obviously results in no one receiving an adequate level of premier benefits. Our United strategy to offer premier members access to more premium seats than each of our competitors is enhancing the value of our frequent flyer loyalty program.', 'I also wanted to take a moment to talk about revenue segmentation. We’ve worked really hard on perfecting segmentation of our products in recent years. Not only do we have multiple product types appealing to a broad range of customers but we also have new, more effective ways to distribute our products by united.com and NDC technology. United is, of course, very focused on growing all of our premium products, given where our hubs are located. When I look back at where United was in 2017, we simply didn’t offer premium products that many of our best customers were willing to pay for. We put a plan in place with United Next to correct this disconnect in our commercial plans and we’re making quick progress. Premium Plus is one of our best examples of segmentation and has been a huge success.', 'Premium Plus third quarter 2023 capacity is 5 times that of 2019, with revenue up 7 times 2019 and is now our most profitable cabin. Premium Plus is now offered on all twin engine international aircraft to United and also will be onboard our new A321XLR jets, which replace our 757 starting in 2025. Another important driver of revenues has been the success of domestic first class. We plan on increasing our first class seats per departure from 9 in 2019 to 16 by 2027, an 80% increase. This increase in first class seats comes as more and more customers are seeking elevated experiences. United’s Basic Economy product represents the other side of the spectrum compared to many of our premium products. Basic has made United more competitive versus ultra low-cost competitors and giving our customers more choices.', 'Basic Economy is now 12% of our domestic passengers, and we expect to be even more competitive in this segment of the market in the future with the arrival of our large narrow-body jets in 2024 and 2025. These new jets have low marginal CASMs allowing United to be price competitive with anyone at any time. While it took time to perfect the offer and we are only in the early stages of inducting these jets, Basic has changed the competitive dynamics of our industry. I think it’s also becoming increasingly clear that United’s core business model of multiple product choices and expanding club network, experience levels from Basic Economy to Polaris provide travelers choices, and for United’s growing premium product choices travelers are willing to pay for.', 'Beyond segmentation, United’s network split evenly between domestic and global capacity. [Technical Difficulty]', 'Operator: Thank you for standing by. We are now live again to the audience.', 'Andrew Nocella: I’ll just end with diversified revenue streams provide United with a resiliency other business models will just not ever achieve. RASM-accretive gauge growth focused in our hubs in turn provides United with the unmatched ability to create cost convergence for years to come with our low-cost providers. Thanks again to the best team in the business. And with that, I will hand it off to Mike.', 'Mike Leskinen: Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the results, I want to take a minute to say how honored and excited I am to join the United executive team during such a transformative time. Industry dynamics are constantly changing, and I continue to see the incredible opportunity ahead for United. We believe our no excuses mentality and clear strategy with United Next are laying the foundation for success. I look forward to continuing the conversations I’ve had with the investment community thus far in my new role, and I’m excited to lead the talented finance team here at United. Now let’s turn to the results. For the third quarter, we delivered pretax earnings of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 10.8%.', 'Our earnings per share of $3.65 was ahead of expectations as our revenue growth came at a full point ahead of our guidance midpoint. Thanks to the amazing commercial team for their great work. They truly are the best in the business. Fuel remains volatile and worked against us in the quarter. Our average fuel price for the quarter ended $0.30 higher than the midpoint of our July expectation and more than accounts for the entirety of the reduced outlook for the third quarter. Our CASM-ex remained on track at up 2.6% versus the third quarter of 2022. Our operation to Tel Aviv has been impacted by the recent events in the region and is materially impacting our outlook as this market represents approximately 2% of our capacity. For the fourth quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be up approximately 3.5%, with capacity up 15.5%, both versus the fourth quarter of last year.', 'Our guidance incorporates no service to Tel Aviv through the end of October. If flights are further suspended through the end of the year, it would reduce capacity by an additional approximately 1.5 points and add approximately 1.5 points of CASM-ex as it’s very difficult to cut the associated expenses related to this flying so close in. These changes bring capacity for the full year, up around 17.5% year-over-year, just below our guidance. We’re proud of that result given all the headwinds United and our industry faced, a huge testament to the hard work of our operations team. Lower capacity along with elevated maintenance expense has pressured CASM-ex and pushed us above the high end of our CASM-ex range for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share of approximately $1.80 with an average fuel price of approximately $3.28.', 'Absent our Tel Aviv flying through the rest of the year, our fourth quarter earnings per share would be reduced by approximately $0.30. Looking ahead to 2024, we feel good about the core fundamentals of our expenses. However, we are facing sizable headwinds with labor in expectation of a new flight attendant agreement and continued higher maintenance expense. We believe our capacity growth, along with improvements in utilization are helpful tailwinds as we manage down expenses. We are working through our 2024 budget and new projections for 2024 capacity, CASM-ex and our other financials, and we’ll provide a customary guidance on our January call. On the fleet, in the third quarter, we took delivery of 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and paid for 14 of those aircraft with cash.', 'We expect to take delivery of 20 737 MAX aircraft in the fourth quarter, and we took delivery of our first Airbus A321neo last week. This is a reduction of 12 aircraft versus our plan in July for the second half of the year. Due to these aircraft shifting into 2024, we now expect our full year 2023 adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $8 billion. Earlier this month, we announced our order for 60 A321neos and exercised options for 50 787s for delivery in 2028 and beyond. Managing the delivery skyline for the future of United is critical. This order builds on the successes we are already seeing with United Next and reflects our confidence as we extend our planning into the next decade. With the retirement of our Boeing 757 and 767 fleet later this decade, these aircraft are important additions as we work towards fleet simplification and capitalize on our cost reduction opportunity.', 'Turning briefly to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with almost $19 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Before we end our prepared remarks today, it’s important to recognize that while our financial results remain strong, as an industry, we are facing new and unique challenges. Our growth has helped us deliver strong relative cost performance, and that’s even before we begin the accelerated gauge growth that we expect will come from the 737 MAX 10 and the A321 additions to our fleet. We are committed to continuing to deliver industry-leading cost performance. And this will form the foundation for continued cost convergence and improving absolute profitability. And because our growth is focused on our hubs, we’re also growing with industry-leading PRASM.', 'There are and will always be headwinds facing our industry, but as we enter 2024, United has great momentum, and I’m confident of very bright future. With that, I’ll hand it over to Kristina to start the Q&A.', 'Kristina Edwards: Thank you, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Silas, please describe the procedure to ask questions.', 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jamie Baker from JP Morgan.', 'See also 30 Celebrities Who Have Normal Jobs Now and 15 Most Expensive Hybrid Cars in 2023.', 'Jamie Baker: So following up on some of the prepared remarks, probably for Andrew or maybe Scott, I can’t recall a time when there’s been such a CASM between domestic yields at United and those of the LMAs. How would you rank order the drivers of this? How much is reflective of low-end consumer weakness? How much is your own success with Basic Economy, how much is loyalty, maybe the LMAs are just selling out too far in advance. Just trying to assess the permanence of the phenomenon, so if you could rank order the drivers, that would be great.', 'Andrew Nocella: Hi Jamie. I’ll try to give that a try. I mean, rank order them maybe a little difficult, but let’s see what we can do. I do think your question is really one of the most important questions that anyone could ask today because there’s such a difference occurring versus the past. And clearly, what I think I would start off is there’s a large range of business models today that didn’t exist in years past in this business. And these models are clearly creating winners and losers in a way many of us did not anticipate during the pandemic. I recall telling all of you on the Q1 2022 call that industry domestic margins will be challenging post-pandemic. Clearly, the thinking at the time was -- for most, at least, was that all airlines would be pressured equally at best are the legacy carriers even more so.', 'Right? It was widely assumed that lower margin, higher cost legacy carriers, which shrink rebalance in supply and demand, an outcome that has happened so many times in the past, so why not again? The number of times I heard that the airline with the lowest cost wins the race, I can’t even begin to count. So, that kind of sets up what about the business models has shifted so much to cause this paradigm change we’re seeing today. Why are these low-cost airlines so unprofitable? Why does United have top tier results? And first, I just want to be really clear. United’s domestic network is profitable. So it’s not simply our great global network that’s creating this outcome for us. The first issue, of course, Mike talked about it is cost.', 'Every airline has to manage higher inflationary cost pressures with the lowest cost carriers’ cost structure relative to the legacy carriers are clearly converging. The shrinking cost gap is just a fundamental shift for United and our industry. And I guess, I would rank that number one. You said it’s impossible to run your airline like it’s 2019. High utilization was a critical ingredient for success of certain models, and that’s simply not possible, where we are today. And also having large labor cost differentials are not possible. Low-cost carriers also tend to operate at a very high gauge already. It will be much more difficult for them to drive cost materially lower with larger gauge planes like United. United has increased domestic gauge more than any airline since 2019, and our plan is to push that even further in the years to come.', 'Another issue that I think we should talk about is it’s difficult for many to grasp is not every ASM is created equal. It’s easy to mistake often in the middle of really large spreadsheets that everyone uses to evaluate our outlook, right? At United, we proved this point early in 2018 and ‘19 with our growth and revenue performance and we just did it again in Q3. Market saturation of the low-cost business model in certain regions is creating very low marginal RASMs for some of our competitors. In fact, many of our competitors have marginal revenue percentages that are negative. There are only so many seats Florida, Cancun or Vegas can support in such a short period of time. Also low-cost carriers generally must operate a very large gauge equipment to have low-cost without the connectivity benefit of the hub-and-spoke business model, expansion of the low-cost model into smaller and medium-sized markets with these very large jets lacking connectivity just creates low marginal RASMs. Market saturation and the mismatch of gauge and other connectivity continues to plague certain business models.', 'Expansion opportunities with this type of business model are not endless in our view, but in response to that shortcoming, many of our domestic competitors have doubled down with plans for even more growth in 2024. 2024 marginal growth in markets will absolutely be no better than 2023. No airline network team would say, let’s add the bad markets in 2023, so we can save the good ones for 2024. The other factor is the percentage of ASMs that these airlines have in new markets. Very fast growth rates simply create a high percentage of new capacity, which by its nature in the best of times is below average. The fourth quarter -- this fourth quarter, United has less than 1% of our ASMs in new markets versus ‘19. This is an absolute difference maker.', 'And capacity growth is designed as a strategy to maintain low cost without revenue accretive markets to add the entire business model can break. And that is what we think is happening right now. United’s domestic capacity growth has always been about correcting a gauge mismatch created by the overuse of high-cost passenger and friendly single-class regional jets. At United, we have this diversity of revenue streams that provide us long-term stability and earnings that a one-dimensional plan will never achieve. We have a range of products, including array of premium seating options that’s increasingly popular with our travelers. We fly as much capacity in global markets as we do domestically. We fly to big cities and small. We have a great hub-and-spoke business model.', 'United has significant margin accretive growth, and we’ve proven that time and time again. United’s business model can support dramatically higher gauge and once added, we spill less and less traffic to others. United’s higher gauge will create more and more cost conversions between now and 2027. The complexity of United’s product offering is not a disadvantage. It in fact is a structural advantage that generates revenues more than the cost it creates by the complexity and just cannot be replicated. In the past, United and other legacy carriers that have emerged from the crisis smaller, creating excess planes and other resources for others to grow. This time, that will not happen. This time around, it is not United with the low margins.', 'We will not adjust our plans. United’s focus on global markets has clearly won the day in Q3, and you can see that in the results. Our focus on domestic gauge is absolutely the right one. We’ll no longer spill as much revenue to others as we’ve done in the past. Our focus on basic fares means we’ll be able to be even more competitive. United will moderate our domestic growth plan, as I said earlier, for the first half of 2024 because we’re focused on building our Asia Pacific line where we see the strongest short-term results. But I have to say, maybe in our timing, there may be off to a few other -- the timing may be off, Jamie, but the quarters are coming, and there’s a lot of other variables. And I truly am confident that sooner or later, the industry will rebalance like it has done in the past, and the United and a few others with similar diversified revenue streams are going to come out on top.', 'I know that was a long answer.', 'Jamie Baker: Andrew, that’s great. I really do appreciate it. But let me just follow up with a quick philosophical question. If spill carriers can’t make money but full-service airlines can, doesn’t that suggest we’re actually at the optimal amount of domestic capacity rather than the oversupply that investors keep asking me about?', 'Scott Kirby: Well, I guess, I’ll try now. It’s hard to follow, Andrew. That was a great answer and very comprehensive. And probably why we feel that -- what Andrew said is why we feel so different that I recognize everyone on this call feels or that the market feels. We feel really confident about where we’re headed, what this means for margins out in 2026, by the time we’re there. We just feel really confident. But without answering the question about sort of overall industry capacity, I kind of at a high level, think of this, Jamie, to me, one of the most remarkable statistics this quarter is that 90% of the industry revenue growth is going to be at two airlines and 90% of the pretax profitability. We just have better model.', 'And what we’ve tried to do is we went through -- the goal was to create an airline that had better product service experience for customers across the board. We can’t just be a leisure airline. We can’t just be a low fare airline. We can’t just be a premium airline. We need to deliver for all customers. We try to create products that are better on the high end, but all the way down to the low end. I believe strongly that air travel is not a commodity. Some of the industry thinks it’s a commodity. And that’s how you get the low-cost wins, if you believe it’s a commodity. I do not think that. And I think we are proving -- our results of two airlines are proving that air travel is not a commodity. So without commenting on what the total industry growth is, what is happening is to have that differentiated product service experience, getting almost all of the revenue growth and customers are voting with their wallets that those models are working.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Linenberg: Congratulations, Mike, on your promotion, and Kristina on your recognition. Scott, I’m going to go to the other end, kind of the side of your business that caters to, call it, the higher-end consumer. And I guess when I think about just the recent top-up order on the 787s, adding to your current order, I mean, it’s significant. I think it’s actually one of the largest widebody orders out there, at least for a U.S. carrier. Is the internal thinking at United just given the shape of the OEMs, whether it’s the manufacturers or the engine makers that we could be facing maybe some kind of widebody shortage in the back half of this decade? What are your thoughts on that?', 'Andrew Nocella: Mike, I’ll give it a try. I do think the production lines for widebody jets don’t produce nearly as many aircraft as the narrow-bodies, as you know. So, there are definitely not as many that are going to be produced. But more to the point, the widebodies we just ordered are for 2028 and beyond. And it’s really our confidence in our plan, but it’s particularly our confidence that we are going to increasingly pivot in the latter part of the decade to global growth and not domestic growth. And so, we secured those positions. We’re confident we’ll use them. We have a significant fleet of 777s and 767s that need to retire at some point later this decade, at least for the 767 for sure. And so with the number of retirements we have, the confidence in our plan and some of the OEM issues that you just brought up, this just made sense.', 'Again, it’s for 2028 and beyond. It’s a long time away. But we are really confident in the plan. We’re confident that global growth, we will have to lean into that, and we will want to lean into that in the latter part of the decade.', 'Mike Leskinen: Hey Mike, this is Mike. I’ll pile on. With the delays in the supply chain, they’ve become persistent. And so, part of what we’re doing is controlling Skyline for a longer period of time than we have historically. This industry has been an industry that has in the past gone from putting out fire to fire. And United Next strategy is putting us on a firmer footing to plan for the longer term. So a, I want to highlight that the contractual delivery dates, they’ve been pushing to the right. And we’ll probably continue to see that. And you see us -- as you see us playing internally, we’ll have some expectation of continued slipping. But make no mistake, we will make adjustments to the order book and the delivery times in a way that maximize the returns to our shareholders. And we will focus on return on invested capital in addition to our pretax margin as we take delivery of those aircraft.', 'Michael Linenberg: Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up. Just any early thoughts on maybe this proposed regulation around credit cards and maybe a cap on merchant fees. I know, it’s proposed legislation, so it obviously has to go through a process, but any sort of early take on it or maybe it’s a TBD?', 'Scott Kirby: I’m happy to answer that. Look, it would be really, really bad policy for consumers in this country. It’s a bill that would -- 84% of U.S. consumers have some kind of rewards card in their wallet, I bet almost everyone on this call has one. And they like them, and they like them a lot. Our customers certainly like them a lot. And so I think it’d be hard in Congress to take a vote that 84% of your voters are going to be upset with the outcome of that vote. And by the way, this will kill rewards program, it would not exist anymore, will kill debit card rewards programs when it happens. And I think it’s a bad policy. And I also think it kind of misses the mark because in the credit card is just a couple of things.', 'And this is the mark with small businesses. I understand the frustration with small businesses. But small businesses are actually -- there’s middleman in between credit card companies, the banks and the small businesses. And I think that’s probably where the bulk of the issues are. Some of those middlemen charge square charges as little as 35 basis points, and some of those middlemen are charging businesses 300 or 400 basis points. And so, I think, it probably misses the mark. And then the final point would be, it’s remarkable how good the cybersecurity is at the credit card process. They’ve invested heavily in it. It’s not easy to replicate. And think about how many billions of transactions are happening every day and how rare breaches or problems are.', 'And so, I think, this is one of those that I’ve spent now a fair amount of time in D.C. talking to people. They didn’t know much about it before because as it’s come up. But as you talk to people about it, they more and more say, well, those are a bunch of good points. We need to go through regular order, we need to examine this. And so I think as long as we do that, as long as we examine it through regular order, which is the right way to pass consequential legislation, the facts will win today and nothing is going to happen.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.', 'Conor Cunningham: Just on cost. I’m trying to understand the trends between your core cost performance and just how these supply chain transitory issues that you’ve laid out are kind of impacting. I realize that it’s probably really hard to tell right now, but you could just frame up when you think some of these potential transitory cost pressures may ease next year? That would be helpful. Thank you.', 'Mike Leskinen: Conor, this is Mike. Let me take a shot at that. And I will acknowledge the 4Q CASM headwind we faced versus our expectations earlier in the year. Let me try to size that. We expect to fly in the fourth quarter about 3 points lower than we thought just three months ago. Now 2 points of that is due to captain upgrade issue that Scott talked about on our last earnings call. The Captain Upgrade issue has impacted the entire industry. We have navigated that really well at United but it did hit us here at the end of the year. Our new contract with ALPA does fix that. And so the -- on the horizon, we have a full expectation that that constraint goes away. But for the fourth quarter, that caused 2 of the 3 points. The other point was due to the violence in Tel Aviv and the loss of that flying.', 'That is something that we can reposition over time, and we would expect to be able to serve Tel Aviv when the violence ceases. And so, those three full points coming out relatively rapidly, you can’t take the cost out. That was the majority of the CASM -- of the increase in the CASM for the fourth quarter. Industry is facing other issues, but that’s what happened here at United. And we expect to mitigate that in 2024 and beyond. The other issue, which I’m not sure how persistent is yet is that maintenance cost. Maintenance costs throughout the years have been higher than we expected. And for United, it’s been -- a big piece has been the increased need for spare parts. That’s on aircraft, but particularly when we repair engines as the work scope has been larger than expected.', 'Some of that is related to supply chain, and it’s difficult to see when that ends. I will add -- and so those were the two components, majority capacity and then some additional headwinds for maintenance in the fourth quarter. We’re not giving 2024 guidance at this time. The industry is facing cost pressures, inflationary cost pressures, labor cost pressures, maintenance cost pressures. What I will commit to today is that United will be industry-leading in how we manage our costs. Cost convergence is a structural trend. It is what is causing the lower-cost carriers and they’re not lower cost for long, low cost carriers to struggle and it is a foundation to United Next. So I don’t know where all that’s going to settle. We will give you guidance as we would normally on the January conference call, but I will commit to industry-leading CASM going forward.', 'Conor Cunningham: Okay. That’s super helpful. And then maybe just a little bit on -- so a lot of your cost stuff next year kind of seems like it’s somewhat capacity-related or delivery -- new delivery related. So, I’m just trying to understand if you could maybe -- is there any swing capacity -- excess in capacity that you may be able to have that could protect some of that growth that you have next year that may be slowed as a result of some of these delivery delays?', 'Mike Leskinen: Conor, you’re thinking about it the right way. But we are -- given all the constraints, we are working to -- in the incremental flights from United being quite profitable, given the great results from our commercial team. We’re going to fly as much as we can to maximize profitability, but we do face some of those constraints. The key around the pressure of growing is you do need to hire folks on board before you actually add the ASM. And so that’s a headwind United faces as long as we’re executing on the United Next strategy. We’re going to work to optimize that. But, that doesn’t go fully away until you would return to a slower growth rate.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Catherine O’Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Catherine Maureen: I noticed in the release you called out the Basic Economy was up 50%, year-over-year. Andrew, can you just dig into what drove that? Is that 12% of domestic passengers? Is that up significantly? Is there also a pricing element?', 'Andrew Nocella: It’s a good question. We -- last year, facing the surge in demand, just maybe the simplest way to say it is we sold out too soon and we didn’t have appropriate room for these basic passengers and are gauge was smaller. And this year, as we get closer to implementing all of our United Next plan, we are much more careful not to sell out too soon. So our close-in bookings are actually quite strong. It’s interesting to say that as I read commentary from around the rest of the industry that kind of says the opposite, and I do have to wonder whether one is tied to the other, obviously. But because we say we didn’t sell out too soon because we have plenty of room and because we have just a normal booking curve for all this, we were able to accommodate those passengers in this quarter, unlike we did in the past.', 'And with the new gauge aircraft coming in the future, we’ll be able to continue to do that going forward. So, I think that’s the simplest and easy explanation as to why you saw that change in our Basic Economy passengers. And look, it’s a product we’ve talked about a lot, provides choice for our customers, on the low end. We have lots of products on the high end as well. It gives us the diversity we need. And I think it’s really allowing us to compete very effectively with all of our competitors, but particularly our ultra-low-cost competitors.', 'Catherine Maureen: That’s great. And then maybe one for Mike, just on a follow-up on the delivery -- continued delivery delays we’re seeing. With the recent announcement on Pratt potentially putting pressure on engine availability and on neo deliveries, I don’t think the MAX 10 has been certified yet, but correct me if I’m wrong. How do we think about that delivery outlook for next year? Are there alternatives to the MAX 10 maybe you would consider, or -- I appreciate now that you guys have in the queue the contractual deliveries versus the expected. But should we expect to see that delta maybe grow when we get the Q later today?', 'Mike Leskinen: That is what we can do is we can manage our expected deliveries versus the contractual deliveries and size the business appropriately, the more that we hire workforce for aircraft that don’t come, they aren’t delivered when we need them, the bigger that headwind is for us. And so, one of the first things I need to do in my new role is to properly size that buffer between expected and contracted delivery. So that’s point one. Point two, we have older aircraft, and we will push some of those older aircraft to fly longer with expected delays in delivery. I happen to love that option because that is also a return on invested capital enhancing. And so, in the long run, we want to simplify the fleet and those MAX 10s are going to be structurally lower cost.', 'We’re excited about them. The A321s are fantastic aircraft. Both of those aircraft are fantastic for a network like United, where gauge -- we get a real advantage out of gauge. I expect those deliveries to really start to drive lower CASM in 2025, not 2024. And so, we should understand the timing of that. But we’ve got numerous levers to manage the delays from the supply chain, and we can do a better job optimizing based on delays that are becoming a little bit more predictable.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Ravi Shanker: I just wanted to follow up on the commentary earlier about you need to cater to all customers, which I totally get kind of given the broad base of the market. But obviously, we’re seeing some of your peers try to push into premier or pushing into the low end. And just kind of the face of it feels like specializing may be an easier thing to go after than trying to cater to everyone with the network and the product you have. So just wanted to dig a little deeper into kind of why that strategy of kind of being everything to everyone rather than being just maybe a full-service premium network airline.', 'Andrew Nocella: I’ll start. I assume others may want to chime in on this. But first, I think there’s a really important distinction in your question that we need to clarify. We’re not trying to be all things to all people within the United States or around the globe. There are parts of our network that don’t cover every single market in the United States. And I think if you were to try and say we are going to cover every single O&D payer in the United States as the world’s largest airline, that would be incredibly challenging, and that is not something we’re trying to do. We are trying in our hubs and all the spokes we serve well from our hubs to make sure we offer a diverse range of products that appeal to all the customers that fly on United Airlines.', 'And some of those customers, by the way, flying United Airlines for business and sometimes the same customers fly on United for leisure, vacation or other needs. And so, they have that optionality to purchase anything from Basic Economy to Polaris as part of that. And if they join MileagePlus, they have obviously a larger chance to get upgraded into our large premium economy sections or into our first class cabins, which are growing. So that diverse set of revenue streams. I know others -- I know it sounds complicated, but it is our secret recipe. It is what the market wants. It’s what our customers want. And we are not trying to be all things to all people. We’re trying to make sure for the customers that fly United that they have a range of product choices for the particular trip they’re going to take on that journey.', 'Scott Kirby: And I would say it as -- it is more complicated. You’re right. It’s simpler if you’re going to only try to appeal to one niche. But the niches are small. The number of markets that exist that you can only be a low-fare, low-cost commoditized player is -- the number one market that exists, but you can only be a premium airline is even smaller. And so, they’re just tiny niches, and we’re a big airline.', 'Mike Leskinen: I’ll just pile on. We fly 200 million passengers annually. And those passengers fly for different reasons, and they -- and the passengers will shift from leisure to business passengers throughout their life. And so it is important that we serve all of them and we serve all of them with a product that suits their needs.', 'Ravi Shanker: That’s very helpful color. Thank you for that. And maybe as a quick follow-up, and apologies if I missed this earlier. There is some speculation about us potentially being at peak international right now, specifically peak transatlantic. What would you say to that kind of going into 2024, kind of do you see enough runway? I think you said in the coming out of the summer of 2022 that 2023 would be a lot bigger and kind of had that visibility? Are you confident that that strength can continue in 2024 as well?', 'Andrew Nocella: Well, I’d say right now, particularly today, for example, we continue to see strength across Atlantic. We particularly see it to Southern Europe, I can tell the industry does by all of our changes, and that’s great to see. So we think that the trends are going to continue. That being said, I did say earlier in my comments that we are going to give the Atlantic a rest. We’ve run a lot since 2019 for sure. And this year, it will be a year of basically no capacity growth across the Atlantic. I said I wasn’t going to give capacity guidance, but clearly, that’s a big hint for a big part of the airline. So, sorry, Mike. And the other thing I’ve said is like the last part of the world to recover is Asia.', 'And Asia is still, however you want to look at it, very strong, we’re growing a lot of capacity on the front. And we’re going to focus our efforts where we see that growth, where we see the profitability opportunity. And if you look at our schedules going into next year, you can see that a gigantic percent change in our capacity is, in fact, Asia. So, we put the capacity where we think we need to put it. We’re really bullish on international. We come a long way. It’s very profitable. And there’s a lot more to come. And as I said, in the latter part of this decade, I think we’ll lean into it even further. We have the right hubs, right gateways where we have the leading business demand, the leading leisure demand and the leading cargo demand.', 'And that recipe is just unique to United, and we’re going to take full advantage of it.', 'Mike Leskinen: I spoke to an earlier question around the -- I spoke to an earlier question around the constraints to industry capacity. And there’s nowhere that that’s more true than for widebody aircraft. In addition to that, as Andrew alluded to, but I’ll just emphasize, we have the best international gateways leaving the United States of any carrier. And so this is where, as Andrew says, we were born on third base, and we’re going to capitalize on that.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Group: So Scott, yesterday, you said that adjustments are inevitable and you expect them by the second half of ‘24. I guess, I’m wondering what -- are you just talking about there are going to be capacity cuts by the second half next year? Are you talking about something bigger than that? And then, when -- yes, go ahead.', 'Scott Kirby: Well, I’m not going to predict what the exact changes are going to be, but here’s what I’d say. There’s been a structural change in the industry. And the structural changes I’ve hinted at this earlier in today’s call. I don’t think air travel is a commodity. Some in the industry think it is, I do not. I think product service experience matter. Everything we’ve been doing in the last three years has been focused on improving that for our customers. That’s true across the board, from the premium, but all the way down to the Basic Economy customers, and particularly as it pertains to low-cost carriers. I think there’s three things that we have done that have completely changed the competitive dynamics there.', 'First, as we’re growing with higher gauge, we now have low marginal CASMs on those big airplanes. We used to try to compete with them with regional jets, we couldn’t compete. We had a high-cost product and we ran out of seat. We now have seats to sell on low marginal CASM on big growing airplane. Second is Basic Economy. And that is a product that is where we can be price competitive but offer a far superior product still than you can get on a low-cost carrier and still be price competitive. And the third is the pivot into leisure markets. We’ve added more capacity and it’s done really well when we’ve added capacity into leisure market. And you put those three things together. And what we’ve tried to do is create a product that customers will choose.', 'And so, what we try to do is create a cost-competitive product for customers but that is better, and so they will choose to fly United. And that is exactly what we’ve done. That’s why I see us have -- two airlines have 98% of the revenue growth. And that makes it hard if you’re someone else. I’m not going to predict what is going to -- what they have to do. But if I was at one of those airlines, I’d be really worried about not having a competitive product with United Airlines. That’s the issue.', 'Scott Group: It strikes me, I don’t think I’ve heard you talk so much and then so positively about Basic Economy in a while. It feels like a change in tone or strategy. Can you just talk about that and why it’s happening now? Is it reflective of the competitive dynamic, the demand environment? Just feels like a change.', 'Scott Kirby: Look, I think it took us a while to work it out. It also helped that some of our competitors with the other direction. I mean charging people $99 at the gate and pay your employees a commission to take their purses away cross the line. And so while they’ve gone in one direction, we’ve gone the other with an improved product. But the other thing that’s really changed during the last year is we finally started to get the gauge right. We couldn’t make this work when we were flying 650 regional jets around the country. And like -- that’s why I like this is all coming together. I love when a plan comes together. This is coming together. And I know it’s not reflected in our stock price yet. And the market is skeptical of it.', 'But this is a plan that is working exactly like we thought it would. And that is the big change for Basic Economy. It’s a better product for us. We’ve figured out how to make it work, but we now have the gauge to be able to sell the product.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.', 'Duane Pfennigwerth: Mike, I was going to congratulate you on the promotion, but given I’m so far back in the queue. No, I’m just kidding. Congrats on the step up here. I don’t want to pile on, on Basic Economy, but I did think the disclosure was kind of interesting. You called out 50% growth, is that simply a function of kind of inventory availability. So this time last year, things were really tight and they’re a bit looser this year, so we can so we can drive that growth. And I guess, depending upon the environment, that 12% of customers was also an interesting stat. So, you can turn the dials and maybe you have kind of half of Spirit Airlines within United inventory to maybe kind of multiple Spirit Airlines within United inventory. I’m guessing you probably pushed back on that metaphor, but maybe you could just speak to kind of inventory availability as a driver there.', 'Andrew Nocella: Well, we’ll probably save that for a more smaller conversation, to be honest. What I would say is the comps last year, we just couldn’t execute the way we wanted to execute. And so, it’s off a small base, it creates a big percentage, but it is a meaningful change. And as I said earlier, we’re going to lean into it. We have these big aircraft coming, and we’re going to be more competitive in the future, not less.', 'Operator: Helane Becker from TD Cowen. You are unmuted. Please go ahead.', 'Helane Becker: Kristina, congratulations. Given I was quoted in the article, I knew it was coming. And Mike, same to you. So here’s my question. As I think about the fact that we have all these infrastructure issues, especially in the New York area that are going to persist for several years, how should we think about two things? You increased gauge, obviously, to capture the demand. But then there’s a point where you want to capture higher ticket prices. So, what’s the sweet spot where you can do both, where you can benefit from capacity limitations with higher aircraft and raise ticket prices so that you improve margins?', 'Scott Kirby: Helane, we think about it through a different prism. We want to provide a good experience to our customers. And New York and New Jersey have not been a good experience for a decade. And the core reason they have is there are more flight schedule than the airports could handle. We are -- we think it is a win for everyone, particularly starting with customers to have the number -- a realistic number of flights that the airport capacity and our traffic control handle in those airports, and we’re very grateful to the FAA for doing that or listening and follow through on that. And we’re anxious to serve as many customers as we can, and so we are upgauging. So we’re flying more seats. We fewer number of flights but more seats as we’re upgauging.', 'And so, we’re focused on delivering for our customers, and that means flying bigger airplanes. Good news is bigger planes also have lower cost per seat. And when the operation runs better, it’s even lower cost per seat, which customers ultimately benefit from, and that’s what we’re doing.', 'Helane Becker: So, is the conclusion that I should have that the revenue is what it would have been, had the infrastructure issue not existed and you flew more flights, but you would have had higher costs, right? This way, you have lower costs and the same amount of revenue. Is that right?', 'Scott Kirby: I don’t know that I’d kind of get into that level of detail you have in your spreadsheet. What I think is we’re going to have a much better experience for customers. I think, we will have lower costs because we’ll have fewer irregular operations, and we’ll have bigger airplanes. And I think that will probably keep prices certainly in line to growing with inflation, be better for our customers, and we’ll be more profitable because we don’t have all the expenses associated with disruption and we don’t have a lot the frustration that comes from that -- from customers. I think this is one of those few situations where it’s a win-win-win for everyone.', 'Mike Leskinen: The worst thing from a cost perspective is irregular operations. That’s what surprises us. We built lots of buffers into the system to control for that. And with a better air traffic control, with airport that is capacity -- appropriately, we can do a lot more optimization.', 'Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Brandon Oglenski: I know it’s been a long call. I just want to get one more in here. But Andrew, I know you’re not -- technically got into 2024, but you also mentioned domestic capacity, I believe in your prepared remarks, we should think about it being pretty much flat, I think, in the first half of the year. But maybe you can clarify that. And what’s driving that? Because I know under your Next strategy, you did want to upgauge domestically. So, is this in concert with OEM delivery expectations, pilots, commercial? I mean, what are you seeing that’s driving that?', 'Andrew Nocella: We’re still putting our plan together. So I don’t want to say it’s final. But -- and I did say in my prepared remarks that we would have -- I forget the exact words, but low type of really slow growth domestically. Look, our commercial efforts are just focused on overseas at this point. And across the Pacific, in particular, into the South Pacific and so we’re executing -- we’re going to execute really well on that capacity, in my opinion, and that’s where our focus. As Mike said, there are a few constraints. We have OEM issues and all that kind of leads to that outcome. And we think it’s the right outcome for our capacity for next year. And we’ll have a lot more to say in early 2024.', 'Operator: We will now switch to the media portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Leslie Josephs from CNBC.', 'Leslie Josephs: I was wondering if you are seeing -- if you can kind of put into context how many requests for status matches you’ve seen since Delta made those changes last month. And then also on your push to premium, can you talk a little bit about the supply chain currently and how far behind you are on upgrading those cabins, and when you expect things to catch up?', 'Andrew Nocella: Sure. Look, I’ll give a little bit of commentary. Our status matches up dramatically. Yes. Is dramatically a big number? No. So, that’s all I’ll say on that front. And in terms of the signature interiors, we are definitely facing some constraints, but I’ll pass that over to Toby, who runs that program for us.', 'Toby Enqvist: Thank you, Andrew. I think we’re about a year behind. But the good news is that we’re still taking in new deliveries. So we’re just right now flying about 120 airplanes that have the new interior design which we have gotten regularly, which is really good for us operationally as well because it has space for one bag for each passenger. So no bag has come out. So that’s probably the biggest thing. So I think right now, we’re targeting 2026 for 100% to be complete.', 'Scott Kirby: Well, I’d just add that this is another one of the things that United got right. We believe back in 2020 that there was going to be a full recovery in demand and thought that the pandemic as tough as it was represented a once in history opportunity to get prepared and invest for the future. So two of the things we did was get ahead of the curve and we built more club space. So we now have 49% more club space than we did before the pandemic. And we just opened our -- two largest clubs in our entire system that are great for customers. Feedback is awesome, one in Denver, one in Newark. So we plan ahead for that. And while the signature interiors are behind, we today have close to double the number of premium seats that we had pre-pandemic.', 'So this is a team that started back in the summer of 2020 to prepare for the recovery in premium demand. And that’s the reason Andrew said in his remarks, we don’t need to change our programs and do anything because we’re prepared for this.', 'Leslie Josephs: Okay. And on the other end of the spectrum with Basic Economy, are customers just flying that because they’re more price sensitive now, or -- and I wasn’t sure 50%, what percentage of your revenue is Basic Economy.', 'Andrew Nocella: Leslie, I would say, it’s likely a lot more share shift that in the previous quarters and years we didn’t have the large gauge aircraft to accommodate all the different range of passenger types and product types adequately. And we are now just beginning, but we have a lot more flexibility, and we’re able to accommodate those passengers and it happened. And I think I would describe it as probably a fair amount of share shift.', 'Operator: Moving to the next caller, Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.', 'Mary Schlangenstein: I wanted to ask you about the situation in Israel. And whether you are assessing potential for that to spread to other areas and perhaps even to some areas of Europe where you may have to cancel more flights because people might be poking away over worries. And if you’re seeing any of that already where that’s shifted to other countries or other cities that you serve?', 'Scott Kirby: We’re not seeing that at all.', 'Operator: Moving to our next caller, Justin Bachman from The Messenger. Please go ahead.', 'Justin Bachman: I wanted to go back to Scott’s point about the industry landscape changing. And I was hoping that you might be able to elaborate a bit on that where -- if we are facing a situation where every American chooses to fly Delta and United, what does that suggest where -- for the rest of the industry as far as other players, do they become smaller, more niche or is there just too many airlines out there? I just wanted to see if you could expand on what that suggests over time.', 'Scott Kirby: I don’t think it suggests that. But I think what we are proving is that customers care about quality product and service. And I think because of that, the airlines that succeed are going to invest in quality product and service. And if you don’t do that, you’re going to fail.', 'Mike Leskinen: And Justin, I’m going to jump in on this as well. What has changed is cost convergence, right? At this point, we’re able to provide incremental seats to our customers at a price point that is competitive with the ULCCs and we provide a better product. And so customers are choosing to fly a better product at a similar price and we are just getting started.', 'Justin Bachman: Right. No, I fully understand that. I’m just thinking, if you play that movie out, what does that suggest for the competitive landscape in two, three, four years if those trends continue and things don’t continue as they have been.', 'Mike Leskinen: That’s a question for those airlines, not for us.', 'Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Edwards for closing remarks.', 'Kristina Edwards: Thanks for joining the call today. Please contact Investor and Media Relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.', 'Operator: Thank you all. This concludes today’s conference, and you may now disconnect.']"

In addition, we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the Q&A. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Thank you, Kristina. I want to start today by saying how heartbroken we are by the horrific attacks on Israel and the escalating conflict in the region that has millions of innocent people in harm's way. Here at United when tragedy strikes anywhere around the world, we focus first on safety and second on how we can use our unique capabilities to help. While we suspended our service to Tel Aviv, we were the first U.S. carrier to add extra flights to Athens where customers connect from airlines operating between Tel Aviv and Athens. We also outgained from regularly scheduled flights to Athens, added a dedicated Tel Aviv support desk, and continued (inaudible) to maximize flexibility for our customers with tickets to Tel Aviv. We're closely monitoring the situation on the ground and staying in close touch with state department officials so that we can resume service as soon as possible. We look forward to the cessation of violence in the region and as we've done in the past crisis around the globe, we expect United to continue to play a meaningful role in the humanitarian response. Turning back to the business. I want to start by welcoming Mike to the leadership team. You all know him well that I'm excited to have him as a partner who agrees with my no-excuses approach who is 100% committed to making United work for our employees, customers and shareholders. I also want to congratulate Kristina for her recent announcement as from Crain's here in Chicago as one of the Top 40 Under 40. The third quarter was another solid milestone to demonstrate that United Next is working as we expected, and the growth we are adding is profitable. Though fuel spiked this quarter, we're very encouraged about our results. It's clear to see why from the numbers. Our top-line revenue grew 12.5% to $14.5 billion, making it as the highest third quarter in our history. Our costs were also on track with our plan as we delivered strong operations in both August and September. United's diverse revenue streams have also allowed us to handle variations in demand and produce solid absolute even better relative results. It's evident in the numbers. United and one other airline expected to account for 98% of the total industry revenue growth this quarter and over 90% of the industry's total pretax profitability.Even in a tough industry environment, United's diverse model is building strong, absolute even more impressive relative margins. So what is it about revenue diversity that makes us different? First, because of our size and industry-leading global network, our loyalty program is the most attractive program in the world for customers and therefore, generates significantly directly earned EBIT, significant loyalty but also a significant opportunity to do even more with it in the future. Expect to hear a lot more details from us on this front starting at an Investor Day in early 2024.Second, we have unmatched geographic diversity with a large domestic network complemented by the largest long-haul international network and both are solidly profitable. While this is a great attribute, it does create some short-term risk and volatility as we're seeing right now with the transitory hit to margins this quarter as a result of the tragedy in Israel. Third, we appeal to both business travelers, and it's been nice to see recent momentum in that segment, but also increasingly the leisure customers as well. We've got a lot more agile at pivoting capacity in the leisure market and not surprisingly have found that our core customers can now fly us in both business and leisure markets as we add seats to leisure destinations. Our ability to move domestic capacity in the leisure markets when they're strong is a consequential driver of our strong relative revenue performance. And fourth, we continue to advance and improve our segmentation efforts. This is a project almost a decade in the making, but all the way from basic economy, which allows us to compete profitably on price on the low end and all the way up to Polaris on long-haul international, United is able to give our customers the real choice they want. So what does that mean going forward? In short, it's a confirmation that United Next is working as we expected. We thought the industry operating environment would be difficult. We thought that medium-term capacity aspirations would be higher than demand growth. We thought that domestic would be a lot tougher than international in the short to medium term. But we also thought United would win share, grow our gauge and grow our connectivity, and that would allow United specifically to improve our results.By the way, we also expect and now believe will happen even faster that the domestic market is going to see a shakeout that leads to an improvement in margins over the medium to long term. It's impossible to call the timing exactly. But I guess that we see meaningful industry changes about 2H '24. And for what it's worth, that's what has happened every single time we've been through one of these cycles in my career. And as that is happening, I'll continue closely tracking the airline industry revenue to GDP relationship. I've talked about this in the past, but that ratio declined by approximately 35% in the past few decades.I don't think we'll make all that up, but almost everything we do makeup goes straight to the bottom line. So in conclusion, I'm proud of the team at United. We're creating something special here. Even in a tough industry environment, we're producing strong absolute results while producing the best relative results in our history. We believe we have a lot of runways ahead of us with United Next and our diverse revenue streams along with our ability to catch up, engage and connectivity positions United well.We expect that the current stress and segments of the industry is also going to lead to structural changes that lay the foundation for an even better future for United, our employees, our customers, and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Brett."", 'Brett J. Hart', ""Thank you, Scott. And thank you to each member of the United team. Your dedication is what continues to propel us to the top. I also want to acknowledge the tragic conflict in Israel. At United, our top priority is the safety of our crews and customers. We are closely monitoring the situation. While in our coordination with the State Department, we have suspended flights to Tel Aviv until the end of October, and we are offering waivers to impacted customers. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust as needed.Mike will provide more detail on the impact of these capacity investments shortly. Last quarter, we announced changes to our operation at Newark to better hedge against disruptions, including taking advantage of FAA-granted waivers to reduce our flight schedule along for necessary airspace relief in the highly congested region. While July was a difficult weather month. The Newark waivers and other proactive measures to improve reliability helped avoid pre-pandemic levels of ATC-related delays. In the third quarter, delayed arrivals were down 16 points versus the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, in August, we had the fewest cancels of any August in history, while operating the third-largest quarter wide-body schedule ever. In September, the FAA granted extensions to the New York airspace waivers, allowing the ability to maintain a reduced flight schedule at Newark that will help minimize air traffic delays through the rest of the year. The flexibility enabled by waivers are proving to be successful in ensuring operational reliability and resiliency at our largest international hub and have meaningfully improved the travel experience for our customers traveling in and out of Newark and throughout our network. Looking to our system operations. During the quarter, we carried over 482,000 revenue passengers daily. The most in any quarter in United's history. The top-tier system customer D00 in August and September. We're grateful to the FAA for allowing us to make necessary adjustments in Newark work and thank our employees who worked hard to get our customers to their destinations safely and on time. While most of our network has recovered to 2019 capacity levels or beyond. Our China network has been last to recover. At the start of the quarter, we were operating 4 flights a week from San Francisco to Shanghai. And this month, we increased that to a daily flight.Next month, we will be the first U.S. airline to return to Beijing with a daily flight from San Francisco. We believe this measured approach to bringing China capacity back online as appropriate as demand slowly recovers. These increased flights are a significant step forward in rebuilding our Asia Pacific network. Late last month, our pilots ratified their industry-leading agreement. This contract enables us to continue providing great career opportunities in United, and I'm excited for the future as we continue to execute our United X plan. At this point, we ratified agreements for 4 out of our 5 major work groups. Flight attendants represented by AFA are in active negotiations, and we look forward to sharing an update when we have one. As a reminder, we began accruing for pilot pay rate increases in the first quarter of this year. Our outlook has and continues to represent our expectations for this agreement. And with that, I will hand it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue environment."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Thanks, Brett. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 12.5%. 1 point ahead of our guidance midpoint. TRASM was down 2.8%. PRASM was down 1% and capacity increased 15.7% year-over-year. Capacity came in a bit below our original outlook, mostly due to the changes in our Hawaii flying levels in response to the fires. It's nice to come in ahead of our revenue outlook as the strong Q3 outcome further validates that our United Next commercial strategies are working well and that we have differentiated United from our competition. Demand for the Atlantic and the Pacific was truly outstanding, and we see that trend continuing into the fourth quarter. Third-quarter domestic PRASM results were consistent with our year-over-year performance in the second quarter of down 2.1 points. In other words, we saw no real change in our domestic trends in the quarter-over-quarter review. Our focus on prudent gauge growth centered in our hubs resulted in strong positive marginal revenue on our incremental capacity.We did focus a majority of our third-quarter growth on international flying. International capacity increased by 22%. International PRASM was up 1.3% year-over-year. International profit margins remain well ahead of domestic, though domestic margins remain solidly profitable. We also saw strong performance across most of the globe. Clearly, Europe was a standout with capacity being up 12% and with positive PRASM performance. Asia Pacific led international PRASM up 3.8% on 86% more capacity. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect total revenue to be up approximately 10.5% on approximately 15.5% more capacity. This implies TRASM will be down around 4.5% year-over-year. Our guide assumes we began limited service to Tel Aviv began in November. Tel Aviv accounts for approximately 2% of United's consolidated capacity. As we think about the sequential trend in unit revenues, I know many of you are wondering if we are seeing a slowdown. Resurgence of the Pacific flying is resulting in many long-haul flights being added, increasing United's long-haul international stateline by 5 points versus Q3. United's Q4 unit revenue expectations are consistent with Q3 adjusted for the stage. United has taken full advantage of the demand surge across the Pacific with capacity being added to key markets, including the long-pending resumption of daily flights to Beijing, and Shanghai from San Francisco and the addition of Manila, just to name a few. Having done capacity plans in my entire career, I have said that our team is the best in the business. United properly allocated our 2023 growth to international markets over domestic and in domestic markets, we wisely invested in gauge, not scope or depth. Less than 1% of United's domestic capacity this winter is in new markets, not for in 2019. Capacity planning for 2024 will be even more important to achieve our financial goals. While we're not going to provide guidance for 2024 today, we have plans to let the 30% growth we've added to the Atlantic since 2019 mature in 2024. And expect to fly a similar level of capacity in '24 as '23. We also plan on little to no growth for the first half of next year on domestic flying. This preview of our 2024 capacity, I think, will allow United to continue to produce top-tier results as we align with industry conditions. I wanted to touch on a few other important commercial elements today as well. Recently, the question I get asked the most often by our frequent flyers is about potential changes to achieve premier status on United. The good news is we have no material changes planned for 2025 program year. We've carefully managed our premier population in recent years to maintain a robust and valuable set of benefits for each premier member. We very much believe and never causing a situation where everyone has a premier status which obviously results in no one receiving an adequate level of premier benefits. Our United Next strategy offer premier members access to more premium seats than each of our competitors is enhancing the value of our frequent flyer loyalty program. I also wanted to take a moment to talk about revenue segmentation. We've worked really hard on perfecting segmentation of our products in recent years. Not only do we have multiple product types appealing to a broad range of customers but we also have new, more effective ways to distribute our products by united.com and NDC technology. United is, of course, very focused on growing all of our premium products, given where our hubs are located. When I look back at where United was in 2017, we simply didn't offer premium products that many of our best customers were willing to pay for. We put a plan in place with United Next to correct this disconnect in our commercial plans, and we're making quick progress. Premium Plus is one of our best examples of segmentation and has been a huge success. Premium Plus third quarter 2023 capacity is 5x that of 2019, with revenue up 7x 2019 and is now our most profitable cabin. Premium Plus is now offered on all twin-engine international aircraft to United and also on board -- will be onboard our new A321 XLR jets, which replaced our 757 starting in 2025. Another important driver of revenues has been the success in domestic first class.We plan on increasing our first-class seats per departure from 9 in 2019 to 16 by 2027, an 80% increase. This increase in first-class seats comes as more and more customers are seeking elevated experiences. United's Basic Economy product represents the other side of the spectrum compared to many of our premium products. Basic has made United more competitive versus ultra-low-cost competitors and giving our customers more choices. Basic economy is now 12% of our domestic passengers, and we expect to be even more competitive in this segment of the market in the future with the arrival of our large narrow-body jets in 2024 and 2025. These new jets have low marginal CASMs allowing United to be price competitive with anyone at any time. While it took time to perfect the offer and we are only in the early stages of inducting these jets, Basic has changed the competitive dynamics of our industry. I think it's also becoming increasingly care that United's core business model of multiple product choices and expanding club network, experience levels from basic economy to Polaris providing travelers choices, and for United's grown premium product choice travelers are willing to pay for. Beyond segmentation, United network split evenly between domestic and global capacity, our leading positions…"", 'Kristina Munoz', 'In view of that brief interruption, can we continue, Silos?', 'Operator', 'Thank you for standing by. We are now live again to the audience.', 'Kristina Munoz', 'Andrew, you can go ahead..', 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Thank you. I'll just add with diversified revenue streams provide United with a resiliency other business models will just not ever achieve. RASM-accretive gauge growth focused in our hubs in turn provides United with the unmatched ability to create cost convergence for years to come with our low-cost providers. Thanks again to the best team in the business. And with that, I will hand it off to Mike."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Thanks, Andrew. And good morning, everyone. Before I get into the results, I want to take a minute to say how honored and excited I am to join the United executive team during such a transformative time. Industry dynamics are constantly changing, and I continue to see the incredible opportunity ahead for United. We believe our no-excuses mentality and clear strategy with United Next are laying the foundation for success. I look forward to continuing the conversations I've had with the investment community thus far in my new role, and I'm excited to lead the talented finance team here at United. Now let's turn to the results. For the third quarter, we delivered pretax earnings of $1.6 billion and a pretax margin of 10.8%. Our earnings per share of $3.65 was ahead of expectations as our revenue growth came at a full point ahead of our guidance midpoint. Thanks to the amazing commercial team for their great work. They truly are the best in the business. Fuel remains volatile and worked against us in the quarter. Our average fuel price for the quarter ended $0.30 higher than the midpoint of our July expectation and more than accounts for the entirety of the reduced outlook for the third quarter. Our CASM-ex remained on track, up 2.6% versus the third quarter of 2022. Our operation in Tel Aviv has been impacted by the recent events in the region and is materially impacting our outlook as this market represents approximately 2% of our capacity. For the fourth quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be up approximately 3.5%, with capacity up 15.5%, both versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our guidance incorporates no service to Tel Aviv through the end of October. If flights are further suspended through the end of the year, it would reduce capacity by an additional approximately 1.5 points and add approximately 1.5 points of CASM-ex as it's very difficult to cut the associated expenses related to this flying so close in.These changes bring capacity for the full year, up around 17.5% year-over-year just below our guidance. We're proud of that result given all the headwinds United and our industry faced, a huge testament to the hard work of our operations team. Lower capacity along with elevated maintenance expense has pressured CASM-ex and pushed us above the high end of our CASM-ex range for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share of approximately $1.80 with an average fuel price of approximately $3.28. Absent our Tel Aviv flying through the rest of the year, our fourth-quarter earnings per share would be reduced by approximately $0.30. Looking ahead to 2024, we feel good about the core fundamentals of our expenses. However, we are facing sizable headwinds with labor and expectation of a new flight attendant agreement and continued higher maintenance expenses. We believe our capacity growth, along with improvements in utilization are helpful tailwinds as we manage our expenses. We are working through our 2024 budget and new projections for 2024 capacity, CASM-ex and our other financials, and we'll provide our customary guidance on our January call. On the fleet, in the third quarter, we took delivery of 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and pay for 14 of those aircraft with cash. We expect to take delivery of 2737 MAX aircraft in the fourth quarter, and we took delivery of our first Airbus A321neo last week. This is a reduction of 12 aircraft versus our plan in July for the second half of the year. Due to these aircraft shifting into 2024, we now expect our full year 2023 adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $8 billion. Earlier this month, we announced for sixty A321neo and exercised options for fifty 787s for delivery in 2028 and beyond. Managing the delivery skyline for the future of United is critical. This order builds on the successes we have already seen with United Next and reflects our confidence as we extend our planning into the next decade. With the retirement of our Boeing 757 and 767 fleet later this decade, these aircraft are important additions as we work towards fleet simplification and capitalize on our cost reduction opportunity. Turning briefly to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with almost $19 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Before we end our prepared remarks today, it's important to recognize that while our financial results remain strong, as an industry, we are facing new and unique challenges. Our growth has helped us deliver strong relative cost performance, and that's even before we begin the accelerated gauge growth that we expect will come from the 737 MAX 10 and the A321 additions to our fleet. We are committed to continuing to deliver industry-leading cost performance. And this will form the foundation for continued cost convergence and improving absolute profitability. And because our growth is focused on our hubs, we're also growing with industry-leading PRASM. There are and will always be headwinds facing our industry. But as we enter 2024, United has great momentum, and I'm confident a very bright future. With that, I'll hand it over to Kristina to start the Q&A."", 'Kristina Munoz', 'Thank you, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community. (Operator Instructions)', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.', 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""So following up on some of the prepared remarks, probably for Andrew or maybe Scott, I can't recall a time when there's been such a chasm between domestic yields at United, and those of the [LMAs.] How would you rank order the drivers of this? How much is reflective of low-end consumer weakness? How much is your own success with basic economy, how much is loyalty, maybe the LMAs are just selling out too far in advance. Just trying to assess the permanence of the phenomenon. So if you could rank order the drivers, that would be great."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Jamie, I'll try to give that a try, I mean, rank order them may be a little difficult, but let's see what we can do. I do think your question is really one of the most important questions that anyone could ask today because there's such a difference occurring versus the past. And clearly, what I think I would start off is there's a large range of business models today that didn't exist in years past in this business. And these models are clearly creating winners and losers in a way many of us did not anticipate during the pandemic. I would call telling all of you on the Q1 [2022] call that industry domestic margins will be challenging post-pandemic. Clearly, the thinking at the time was -- for most, at least, was that all airlines would be pressured equally at best are the legacy carriers even more so, right? It was widely assumed that lower margin, higher cost legacy carriers, which shrink, rebalancing supply and demand, an outcome that has happened so many times in the past. So why not again? The number of times I heard that the airline with the lowest cost wins the race, I can't even begin to count. So that kind of sets up what about the business models has shifted so much to cause this paradigm change we're seeing today.Why are these low-cost airlines so unprofitable? Why does United have top-tier results and first, I just want to be really clear, United domestic network is profitable. So it's not simply our great global network that's creating this outcome for us. The first issue, of course, Mike talked about it is cost, every airline has to manage higher inflationary cost pressures with the lowest cost carriers' cost structure relative to the legacy carriers are clearly converging.The shrinking cost gap is just a fundamental shift for United in our industry. And I guess I would rank that number one. You said it's impossible to run your airline like it is in 2019. High utilization was a critical ingredient for success of certain models, and that's simply not possible where we are today. And also having large labor cost differentials are not possible. Low-cost carriers also tend to operate at a very high gauge already. It will be much more difficult for them to drive cost materially lower with larger gauge plans like United. United has increased domestic gauge more than any airline since 2019, and our plan is to push that even further in the years to come. Another issue that I think we should talk about is it's difficult for many to graph, not every ASM is created equal. It's easy to mistake made often in the middle of really large spreadsheets that everyone uses to evaluate our outlook, right? At United, we proved this point early in 2018 and '19 with our growth and revenue performance and we just did it again in Q3.Market saturation of the low-cost business model in certain regions is creating very low marginal RASMs for some of our competitors. In fact, many of our competitors have marginal revenue percentages that are negative. There are only so many seats of Florida, Cancun or Vegas can support in such a short period of time. Also low-cost carriers generally must operate a very large gaming equipment to have low-cost without the connectivity benefit of the hub-and-spoke business model, expansion of the low-cost model into smaller and medium-sized markets with these very large jets lack in connectivity just creates low marginal RASMs.Market saturation and the mismatch of gauge and other connectivity continues to plague certain business models, expansion opportunities with this type of business model are not endless in our view, but in response to that shortcoming, many of our domestic competitors have doubled down with plans for even more growth in 2024. 2024 marginal growth in markets will absolutely be no better than 2023. No airline network team would say, let's add the bad markets in 2023, so we can save the good ones for 2024. The other factor is the percentage of ASMs that these airlines have in new markets. Very fast growth rates simply create a high percentage of new capacity, which by its nature in the best of times is below average. The fourth quarter -- this fourth quarter, United has less than 1% of our ASMs in new markets versus '19. This is an absolute difference maker. And capacity growth is designed as a strategy to maintain low cost without revenue accretive markets to add the entire business model can break. And that is what we think is happening right now.United's domestic capacity growth has always been about correcting a gauge mismatch created by the overuse of high-cost passenger and friendly single-class regional jets. At United, we have this diversity of revenue streams that provide us long-term stability in earnings that one-dimensional plan will never achieve. We have a range of products, including array of premium seating options that's increasingly popular with our travelers.We fly as much capacity in global markets as we do domestically. We fly to big cities and small. We have a great hub-and-spoke business model. United has significant margin accretive growth, and we've proven that time and time again. United's business model can support dramatically higher gauge and once added, we send less and less traffic to others. United's higher gauge will create more and more cost conversions between now and 2027. The complexity of United's product offering is not a disadvantage. It in fact is a structural advantage that generates revenues more than the cost it creates by the complexity and just cannot be replicated. In the past, United and other legacy carriers that have emerged from the crisis smaller, creating excess plans and other resources for others to grow. This time, that will not happen. This time around, it is not United with the low margins. We will not adjust our plans. United's focus on global markets has clearly won the day in Q3, and you can see that in the results. Our focus on domestic gauge is absolutely the right one. We'll no longer spill as much revenue to others as we've done in the past. Our focus on basic fares means we'll be able to be even more competitive. United will moderate our domestic growth plan, as I said earlier, for the first half of 2024 because we're focused on building our Asia Pacific line where we see the strongest short-term results. But I have to say, maybe in our timing, there may be off to a few other -- the timing may be off, Jamie, but the quarters are coming, and there's a lot of other variables. And I truly am confident that sooner or later, the industry will rebalance like it has done in the past, and the United and a few others with similar diversified revenue streams are going to come out on top. I know that was a long answer. I didn't rank exactly the way you want..."", 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""Andrew, that's great. I really do appreciate it. But let me just follow up with a quick philosophical question. If spill carriers can't make money but full-service airlines can. Doesn't that suggest we're actually at the optimal amount of domestic capacity rather than the oversupply that investors keep asking me about?"", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Well, I guess I'll try now. It's hard to follow Andrew. That was a great answer and very comprehensive. And probably what we feel that what Andrew said is why we feel so different that I recognize everyone on this call feels or then the market feels. We feel really confident about where we're headed, what this means for margins out in 2026. By the time we're there, we just feel really confident. But without answering the question about sort of overall industry capacity, I kind of at a high level, think of this, Jamie is, to me, one of the most remarkable statistics this quarter is that 90% of the industry revenue growth is going to be at 2 airlines and 90% of the pretax profitability. We just have better model. And what we've tried to do is we went through -- the goal was to create an airline that had better product service experience for customers across the board. We can't just be a leisure airline. We can't just be a low fair airline. We can't just be a premium airline. We need to deliver for all customers. We try to create products that were better on the high end, but all the way down to the low end. I believe strongly that air travel is not a commodity. Some of the industry thinks it's a commodity. And that's how you get the low-cost wins, if you believe it's a commodity, I do not think that. And I think we are proving -- our results of 2 airlines are proving that air travel is not a commodity. So without commenting on what the total industry growth is, what is happening is to have that differentiated product service experience are getting almost all of the revenue growth and customers are voting with their wallets and those models are working."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.', 'Michael John Linenberg', ""Yes. Congratulations, Mike, on your promotion and Kristina on your recognition. Scott, I'm going to go to the other end, kind of the side of your business that caters to call it the higher-end consumer. And I guess when I think about just the recent top-up order on the 787s, adding to your current order, I mean, it's significant. I think it's actually one of the largest wide-body orders out there, at least for a U.S. carrier. Is the internal thinking at United just given the shape of the OEMs, whether it's the manufacturers or the engine makers that we could be facing maybe some kind of wide-body shortage in the back half of this decade? What are your thoughts on that?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Mike, I'll give it a try. I do think the production lines for wide-body jets don't produce nearly as many aircraft as the narrow-bodies, as you know. So there are definitely not as many that are going to be produced. But more to the point, the wide-bodies we just ordered are for 2028 and beyond. And it's really our confidence in our plan, but it's particularly our confidence that we are going to increasingly pivot in the latter part of the decade to global growth and not domestic growth. And so we secured those positions. We're confident we'll use them. We have a significant fleet of 777 and 767 that need to retire at some point later this decade, at least for the 767 for sure. And so with the number of retirements we have, the confidence in our plan and some of the OEM issues that you just brought up, this just made sense. Again, it's for 2028 and beyond. It's a long time away. But we are really confident in the plan. We're confident that global growth we will have to lean into that, and we will want to lean into that in the latter part of the decade."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Mike, this is Mike. I'll pile on. With the delays in the supply chain, they've become persistent. And so part of what we're doing is controlling skyline for a longer period of time than we have historically. This industry has been an industry that has in the past gone from putting out fire to fire and United Next strategy is putting us on a firmer footing to plan for the longer term. So a, I want to highlight that the contractual delivery dates, they've been pushing to the right. And we'll probably continue to see that. And you see us -- as you see us playing internally, we'll have some expectation of continued slipping. But make no mistake, we will make adjustments to the order book and the delivery times in a way that maximizes the returns to our shareholders. And we will focus on return on invested capital in addition to our pretax margin as we take delivery of those aircraft."", 'Michael John Linenberg', ""Okay. Great. And just one quick follow-up. Just any early thoughts on maybe this proposed regulation around credit cards and maybe a cap on merchant fees. I know it's proposed legislation, so it obviously has to go through a process, but any sort of early take on it or maybe it's a TBD?"", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""I'm happy to answer that. Look, it would be really, really bad policy for consumers in this country. It's a bill that would 84% of U.S. consumers have some kind of rewards card in their wallet, almost everyone in this call has one. And they like them a lot. Our customers certainly like them a lot. And so I think it'd be hard in Congress to take a vote that 84% of your voters are going to be upset with the outcome of that vote. And by the way, this kill rewards program that would not exist anymore. We kill debit card rewards programs when it happens. And I think it's a bad policy. And I also think it kind of misses the mark because in the credit card is just a couple of things. And this is the market with small businesses. I understand the frustration with small businesses. But small businesses are actually -- there's middleman in between credit card companies, the banks and the small businesses. And I think that's probably where the bulk of the issues are. Some of those middlemen charge, square charges as little as 35 basis points, and some of those middlemen are charging businesses 300 or 400 basis points. And so I think it probably misses the market. And then the final point would be, it's remarkable how good the cybersecurity is at the credit card process.They've invested heavily in it. It's not easy to replicate. Let me think about how many billions of transactions are happening every day and how rare breaches or problems are. And so I think this is one of those that I've spent now a fair amount of time in D.C. talking to people. They didn't know much about it before because as it's come up. But as you talk to people about it, they more and more say, well, those are a bunch of good points. We need to go through regular order, we need to examine this. And so I think as long as we do that, as long as we examine it through order, which is the right way to pass consequential legislation. The facts will win today and nothing is going to happen. It won't..."", 'Operator', 'Next question from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.', 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Just on cost. I'm trying to understand the trends between your core cost performance and just how these supply chain transitory issues that you've laid out are kind of impacting. I realize that it's probably really hard to tell right now, but you could just frame up when you think some of these potential transitory cost pressures may ease next year. That would be helpful."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Conor, this is Mike. Let me take a shot at that. And I won't acknowledge the 4Q CASM headwind we faced versus our expectations earlier in the year. Let me try to size that. We expect to fly in the fourth quarter about 3 points lower than we thought just 3 months ago. Now 2 points of that is due to captain upgrade issue that Scott talked about on our last earnings call. The captain upgrade issue has impacted the entire industry. We have navigated that really well at United but it did hit us here at the end of the year. Our new contract with ALPA does fix that. And so the -- on the horizon, we have a full expectation that constraint goes away. But for the fourth quarter, that caused 2 of the 3 points. The other point was due to the violence in Tel Aviv and the loss of that flying. That is something that we can reposition over time, and we would expect to be able to serve Tel Aviv when the violence ceases. And so those 3 full points coming out relatively rapidly, you can't take the cost out. That was the majority of the CASM of the increase in the CASM for the fourth quarter. Industry is facing other issues, but that's what happened here at United. And we expect to mitigate that in 2024 and beyond. The other issue, which I'm not sure how persistent is yet is that maintenance cost. Maintenance costs throughout the years have been higher than we expected. And for United, it's been a big piece -- has been the increased need for spare parts. That's on aircraft, but particularly when we repair engines as the work scope has been larger than expected. Some of that is related to supply chain, and it's difficult to see when that ends. I will add -- and so those were the 2 components. Majority capacity and then some additional headwinds for maintenance in the fourth quarter. We're not giving 2024 guidance at this time. The industry is facing cost pressures, inflationary cost pressures, labor cost pressures, maintenance cost pressures. What I will commit to today is that United will be industry-leading in how we manage our costs. Cost convergence is a structural trend. It is what is causing the lower-cost carriers and they're not lower cost for long, the low-cost carriers to struggle and it is a foundation to United Next. So I don't know where all that's going to settle. We will give you guidance as we would normally on the January conference call, but I will commit to industry-leading CASM going forward."", 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Okay. That's super helpful. And then maybe just a little bit on -- so a lot of your cost stuff next year kind of seems like it's somewhat capacity-related or delivery -- new delivery related. So I'm just trying to understand if you could maybe -- is there any swing capacity -- excess swing capacity that you may be able to have that could protect some of that growth that you have next year that may be slowed as a result of some of these delivery delays."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""You're thinking about it the right way. But we are -- given all the constraints, we are working to -- in the incremental flights from United being quite profitable, given the great results from our commercial team. We're going to fly as much as we can to maximize profitability, but we do face some of those constraints. The key around -- the key around the pressure of growing is you do need to hire folks on board before you actually add the ASM. And so we -- that's a headwind United faces as long as we're executing on the United Next strategy. We're going to work to optimize that, but that doesn't go fully away until you would return to a slower growth rate."", 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", 'And congrats, Mike and Kristina. I noticed in the release you called out the basic economy was up 50% year-over-year. Andrew, can you just dig into what drove that? Is that 12% of domestic passengers? Is that up significantly? Is there also a pricing element?', 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""It's a good question. Last year, facing the surge in demand. Just maybe the simplest way to say it is we sold out too soon and we didn't have appropriate room for these basic passengers and are engaged with smaller and this year, as we get closer to implementing all of our United Next plans, we were much more careful not to sell out too soon. So our close-in bookings are actually quite strong. It's interesting to say that as I read commentary from around the rest of the industry that kind of says the opposite, and I do have to wonder whether one is tied to the other, obviously. But because we say we didn't sell out too soon because we have plenty of room and because we have just a normal booking curve for all this, we were able to accommodate those passengers in this quarter, unlike we did in the past. And with the new gauge aircraft coming in the future, we'll be able to continue to do that going forward. So I think that's the simplest and easiest explanation as to why you saw that change in our basic economy passengers. And look, it's a product we've talked about a lot, provides choice for our customers on the low end. We have lots of products on the high end as well. It gives us the diversity we need. And I think it's really allowed us to compete very effectively with all of our competitors, but particularly our ultra-low-cost competitors."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""That's great. And then maybe one for Mike, just a follow-up on the delivery -- continued delivery delays we're seeing. With the recent announcement on Pratt potentially putting pressure on engine availability on neo deliveries. And then I don't think the MAX 10 has been serviced yet, but correct me if I'm wrong, how do we think about that delivery outlook for next year? Are there alternatives to the MAX 10 maybe you would consider? Or I appreciate now that you guys have in the queue of the contractual deliveries versus the expected. But should we expect to see that delta maybe grow when we get the queue later today?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Thanks for the question, Katy. That is what we can do is we can manage our expected deliveries versus the contractual deliveries and size the business appropriately, the more that we hire workforce for aircraft that don't come, they weren't delivered when we needed them, the bigger that headwind is for us. And so one of the first things I need to do in my new role is to properly size that buffer between expected and contracted delivery. So that's point one. Point two, we have older aircraft, and we will push some of those older aircraft to fly longer with expected delays in delivery. I happen to love that option because that is also a return on invested capital enhancing. And so in the long run, we want to simplify the fleet and those MAX 10s are going to be structurally lower cost. We're excited about them. The A321s are fantastic aircraft. Both of those aircraft are fantastic for a network like United, where gauge -- we get a real advantage out of gauge. I expect those deliveries to really start to drive lower CASM in 2025, not 2024. And so we should understand the timing of that. But we've got numerous levers to manage the delays from the supply chain, and we can do a better job optimizing based on delays that are becoming a little bit more predictable."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ravi Shanker', ""I just wanted to follow up on the commentary earlier about you need to cater to all customers, which I totally get kind of given the broad base of the market. But obviously, we're seeing some of your peers try to push into premier or pushing into the low end. And I know just kind of the face of it feels like specializing may be an easier thing to go after than trying to cater to everyone with the network and the product you have, so kind of just wanted to get us -- dig a little deeper into kind of why that strategy of kind of being everything to everyone rather than being just maybe a full-service premium network airline."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""I'll start. I assume others may want to chime in on this. But first, I think there's a really important distinction in your question that we need to clarify. We're not trying to be all things to all people within the United States or around the globe. There are parts of our network that don't cover every single market in the United States. And I think if you were to try and say we are going to cover every single O&D player in the United States, the world's largest airline, that would be incredibly challenging, and that is not something we're trying to do. We are trying in our hubs and all the folks we serve well from our hubs to make sure we offer a diverse range of products that appeal to all the customers that fly on United Airlines. And some of those customers, by the way, flying United Airlines for business and sometimes the same customers fly on United for leisure vacation or other needs. And so they have that optionality to purchase anything from basic economy to Polaris as part of that. And if they join MileagePlus, they have obviously a larger chance to get upgraded into our large premium economy sections are into our first-class cabins, which are growing. So that diverse set of revenue streams -- I know others -- I know it sounds complicated, but it is our secret recipe. It is what the market wants. It's what our customers want. And we are not trying to be all things to all people. We're trying to make sure for the customers that fly United that they have a range of product choices for the particular trip they're going to take on that journey."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""And I would say it as -- it is more complicated. You're right. It's simpler to you're going to only try to appeal to one niche. But the niches are small. The number of markets that exist that you can only be a low-fare, low-cost commoditized player Is -- the number of markets that exist that you can only be a premium airline is even smaller. And so they're just tiny niches, and we're a big airline.And I will just pile on, we fly 200 million passengers annually. And those passengers fly for different reasons, and they -- in the passengers will shift from leisure to business passengers throughout their life. And so it is important that we serve all of them and we serve all of them with a product that suits their needs."", 'Ravi Shanker', ""That's very helpful color. And maybe as a quick follow-up, and apologies if I missed this earlier. There is some speculation about us potentially being at peak international right now, specifically peak transatlantic. What would you say to that kind of going into 2024? Kind of do you see enough runway? I think you said in the coming out of the summer of 2022, that 2023 would be a lot bigger and kind of had that visibility. Are you confident that, that strength can continue in 2024 as well?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Well, I'd say right now, particularly today, for example, we continue to see strength across Atlantic. We particularly see it to Southern Europe, I can tell the industry does by all of our changes, and that's great to see. So we think that the trends are going to continue. That being said, I did say earlier in my comments that we are going to give the Atlantic a rest. We've run a lot since 2019 for sure. And this year, it will be a year of basically no capacity growth across the Atlantic. I said I wasn't going to give capacity guidance, but clearly, that's a big hint for a big part of the airline. So sorry, Mike. And the other thing I've said is like the last part of the world to recover is Asia. And Asia is still; however, you want to look at it, very strong. We're growing a lot of capacity on the front. And we're going to focus our efforts where we see that growth, where we see the profitability opportunity. And if you look at our schedules going into next year, you can see that a gigantic percent change in our capacity is, in fact, Asia. So we put the capacity where we think we need to put it. We're really bullish on international. We come a long way. It's very profitable. And there's a lot more to come. And as I said, in the latter part of this decade, I think we'll lean into it even further. We have the right hubs, right gateways where we have the leading business demand, the leading leisure demand and the leading cargo demand. And that recipe is just unique to United, and we're going to take full advantage of it."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""I spoke to an earlier question around the -- I spoke to an earlier question around the constraints to industry capacity. And there's nowhere that's more true than for wide-body aircraft. In addition to that, as Andrew alluded to, but I'll just emphasize, we have the best international gateways leaving the United States of any carrier. And so this is where, as Andrew says, we were born on third base, and we're going to capitalize on that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', ""So Scott, yesterday, you said that adjustments are inevitable and you expect them by the second half of '24. I guess I'm wondering what -- are you just talking about there are going to be capacity cuts by the second half next year? Are you talking about something bigger than that? And then when I just -- yes, go ahead, sorry."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Well, I know you predict what the exact changes are going to be, but here's what I'd say. There's been a structural change in the industry. And the structural changes, I've hinted at this earlier in today's call. I don't think air travel is a commodity. Some of the industry think it is, I do not. I think product service experience matters. Everything we've been doing in the last 3 years has been focused on improving that for our customers. That's true across the board, from the premium, but all the way down to the basic economy customers. And it particularly as it pertains to low-cost carriers. I think there's 3 things that we have done that have completely changed the competitive dynamics there. First, as we're growing with higher gauge, we now have low marginal CASM on those big airplanes. We used to try to compete with them with regional jets, we could compete. We had a high-cost product and we ran -- we now have seats to sell on low marginal CASM on big growing airplanes. Second is basic economy. And that is a product that is where we can be price competitive but offer a far superior product still then you can get on a low-cost carrier and still be price competitive. And the third is the pivot into leisure market. We've added more capacity and it's done really well. When we've added capacity into leisure market. And you put those 3 things together. And what we've tried to do is create a product that customers will choose. And so what we try to do is create a cost-competitive product for customers but that is better, and so they will choose to fly United. And that is exactly what we've done. That's why I see us have 2 airlines have 90% of the revenue growth. And that makes it hard if you're someone else. I'm not going to predict what is going to -- what they have to do. But if I was one of those airlines, I'd be really worried about not having a competitive product with United Airlines. That's the issue."", 'Scott H. Group', ""It strikes me, I don't think I've heard you talk so much and then so positively about basic economy in a while. It feels like a change in tone or strategy. Can you just talk about that and why it's happening now? Is it reflective of the competitive dynamic, the demand environment, just feels like a change."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Look, I think it took us a while to work it out. It also helped that some of our competitors with the other direction. I mean charging people $99 at the gate and paying your employees a commission to take their persons away, cross the line. And so while they've gone in one direction, we've gone the other with an improved product. But the other thing that's really changed during the last year is we finally started to get the gauge right. We couldn't make this work when we were flying 650 regional jets around the country. And like that's why I like this is all coming together. I love when a plan comes together. This is coming together. And I know it's not reflected in our stock price yet. And the market is skeptical. But this is a plan that is working exactly like we thought it would. And that is the big change for Basic Economy. It's a better product for us. We've figured out how to make it work, but we now have the gauge to be able to sell the product."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth', ""Mike, I was going to congratulate you on the promotion, but given I'm so far back in the queue. No, I'm just kidding. Congrats on the step up here. I don't want to pile on, on Basic Economy, but I did think the disclosure was kind of interesting. You called out 50% growth is that simply a function of kind of inventory availability. So this time last year, things were really tight and they're a bit looser this year so we can -- so we can drive that growth. And I guess, depending upon the environment, that 12% of customers was also an interesting stat. So you can turn the dials and maybe you have kind of half of Spirit Airlines within United inventory to maybe kind of multiple Spirit Airlines within United inventory? I'm guessing you probably pushed back on that metaphor, but maybe you could just speak to kind of inventory availability as a driver there."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Well, we'll probably save that for a more smaller conversation, to be honest. What I would say is the comps last year, we just couldn't execute the way we wanted to execute. And so it's off a small base, it creates a big percentage, but it is a meaningful change and as I said earlier, we're going to lean into it. We have these big aircraft coming, and we're going to be more competitive in the future, not less."", 'Operator', 'Thank you for standing by. We are now live again to the conference.', 'Kristina Munoz', 'Are we back online?', 'Operator', 'Yes, we are now back online.', 'Kristina Munoz', 'Can you pass it on to the next analyst, which is Helane from Cowen?', 'Operator', 'Absolutely, Helane Becker from TD Cowen. You are unmuted.', 'Helane Renee Becker', ""Kristina, congratulations. Given I was quoted in the article, I knew it was coming. And Mike seemed to you -- so here's my question. As I think about the fact that we have all these infrastructure issues, especially in the New York area that are going to persist for several years. How should we think about 2 things? You increased gauge, obviously, to capture the demand. But then there's a point where you want to capture higher ticket prices. So what's the sweet spot where you can do both, where you can benefit from capacity limitations with higher aircraft and raise ticket prices so that you improve margins?"", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Helane, we think about it through a different prism. We want to provide a good experience to our customers. And New York and New Jersey have not been a good experience for a decade. And the core reason they have is there are more flight schedule than the airports could handle. We are -- we think it is a win for everyone, particularly starting with customers to have the number -- a realistic number of flights at the airport capacity, air traffic control handling those airports, and we're very grateful to the FAA for doing that or listening and follow through on that. And we're anxious to serve as many customers as we can, and so we are upgauging. So we're providing more seats. We providing fewer number of flights but more seats as we're upgauging. And so we're focused on delivering for our customers, and that means providing bigger airplanes. Good news is bigger airplanes also have lower cost per seat. And when the operation running better, it's even lower cost per seat, which customers ultimately benefit from, and that's what we're doing."", 'Helane Renee Becker', 'So is the conclusion that I should have that the revenue is what it would have been had the infrastructure issue not existed and you flew more flights, but you would have had higher costs, right? This way, you have lower costs and the same amount of revenue. Is that right?', 'J. Scott Kirby', ""I don't know that I'd kind of get into that level of detail you have in your spreadsheet. What I think is we're going to have a much better experience for customers.I think we will have lower costs because we'll have fewer irregular operations, and we'll have bigger airplanes. And I think that will probably keep prices certainly inline to -- growing with inflation. Be better for our customers, and we'll be more profitable because we don't have all the expenses associated with disruption and we don't have a lot the frustration that comes from that from customers. I think this is one of those few situations where it's a win-win-win for everyone."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""The worst thing from a cost perspective is irregular operations. That's what surprises us. We built lots of buffers into the system to control for that. And with a better -- with better air traffic control, with airport that is capacity appropriately, we can do a lot more optimization."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.', 'Brandon Robert Oglenski', ""Congrats, Mike and Kristina. So I know it's been a long call. I just want to get one more in here. But Andrew, I know you're not technically got into 2024, but you also mentioned domestic capacity, I believe in your prepared remarks, we should think about it being pretty much flat, I think, in the first half of the year, but maybe you can clarify that. And what's driving that? Because I know under your next strategy, you did want to upgauge domestically. So this in concert with OEM delivery expectations, pilots, commercial? I mean, what are you seeing that's driving that?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""We're still putting our plan together. So I don't want to say it's final. But -- and I did say in my prepared remarks that we would have -- I forgot the exact words, but low type of really slow growth domestically. Look, our commercial efforts are just focused on overseas at this point. And across the Pacific, in particular, into the South Pacific and so we're executing -- we're going to execute really well on that capacity, in my opinion, and that's where our focus. As Mike said, there are a few constraints. We have OEM issues and all that kind of leads to that outcome. And we think it's the right outcome for our capacity for next year. And we'll have a lot more to say in early 2024."", 'Operator', 'We will now switch to the media portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) Leslie Josephs from CNBC.', 'Leslie Josephs', ""I was wondering if you are seeing -- if you just kind of put into context how many requests for Status matches you've seen since Delta made those changes last month? And then also on your push to premium, can you talk a little bit about the supply chain currently and how far behind you are on upgrading those cabins and when you expect things to catch up."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Sure. Look, I'll give a little bit of commentary. Our status matches up dramatically? Yes. Is dramatically a big number? No. So that's all I'll say on that front. And in terms of the signature interiors, we are definitely facing some constraints, but I'll pass that over to Toby, who runs that program for us and he will let us know."", 'Torbjorn J. Enqvist', ""Thank you, Andrew. I think we're about a year behind. But the good news is that we're still taking in new deliveries. So we're just right now flying about 120 airplanes that have the new interior design which really gotten great release, and which is really good for us operational as well because there is space for 1 bag for each passenger, so no bags has come out. So that's probably the biggest thing. So I think right now, we're targeting 2026 for 100% to be completed."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""Well, I'd just add that this is another one of the things that United got right, believe us. We believe back in 2020 that there was going to be a full recovery in demand and thought that the pandemic as tough as it was represented a once-in-history opportunity to get prepared and invest for the future. So 2 of the things we did was get ahead of the curve, we built more club space. So we now have 49% more club space than we did before the pandemic. And we just opened our the -- 2 largest clubs in our entire system that are great for customers. Feedback is awesome, one in Denver, one in Newark. So we plan ahead for that. And while the signature interiors are behind, we today have close to double the number of premium seats that we had pre-pandemic. So this is a team that started back in the summer of 2020 to prepare for the recovery in premium demand. And that's the reason Andrew said in his remarks, we don't need to change our programs and do anything because we're prepared for this."", 'Leslie Josephs', ""Okay. And on the other end of the spectrum with Basic Economy, are customers just buying that they're more price-sensitive now? Or -- and I wasn't sure 50%, what percentage of your revenue is basic economy."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Leslie, I would say, likely a lot more share shift that in the previous quarters and years, we didn't have the large gauge aircraft to accommodate all the different range of passenger types and product types adequately. And we are now just beginning, but we have a lot more flexibility, and we're able to accommodate those passengers and it happened. And I think I would describe it as probably a fair amount of share shift."", 'Operator', 'Moving to the next caller, Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.', 'Mary Schlangenstein', ""I wanted to ask you about the situation in Israel. And whether you are assessing potential for that to spread to other areas and perhaps even to some areas of Europe where you may have to cancel more flights because people might be poking away over worries.

Scott Kirby', ""We're not seeing that at all."", 'Operator', 'Moving to our next caller Justin Bachman from the Messenger.', 'Justin Bachman', ""I wanted to go back to Scott's point about the industry landscape changing. And I was hoping that you might be able to elaborate a bit on that, where if we are facing a situation where every American chooses to fly Delta and United, what does that suggest where -- for the rest of the industry as far as other players, do they become smaller, more niche or is there just too many airlines out there? I just wanted to see if you could expand on what that suggests over time."", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""I don't think it suggest that, but I think what we are proving is that customers care about quality, product and service. And I think because of that, the airlines will succeed are going to invest in quality product and services. And if you don't do that, you're going to fail."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""And Justin, I'm going to jump in on this as well. What has changed is cost convergence, right?

And so customers are choosing to fly a better product at a similar price and we are just getting started."", 'Justin Bachman', ""Right. No, I fully understand that. I'm just thinking, if you play that movie out, what does that suggest for the competitive landscape in 2, 3, 4 years, if those trends continue and things don't continue as they have been?"", 'Michael D.

The Federal Reserve is still in a wait and see mode when it comes to rate hikes. Investors are continuing to look over their shoulders for incoming data to gauge the state of the consumer in the country and whether inflation is really cooling as many optimistic corners of the market like to suggest. In this environment, dividend stocks remain relevant as history shows dividend equities always perform better during troubled times. Consider this, in just two weeks in February 2023, investors poured a whopping $272 million into U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds that buy dividend-paying stocks, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. These funds saw inflows of $48 billion in 2022. However, when 2023 started off with a bang thanks in part to the AI boom and rise of tech stocks, these funds saw an exodus of $835 million.

A T. Rowe Price report from March 2023 said that when a company is consistently raising its dividends, it’s evident that it’s handling its cash and business properly and its future prospects are bright.

But the report said that if a company has a low but growing dividend, it should be considered for the following reasons:', '“Avoiding low‑yield stocks without a careful evaluation of the companies’ prospects comes with pitfalls. Low yet growing dividends may point to companies that are on a path of earnings expansion, with cash flows that are starting to exceed their capital expenditure needs.

We have also discussed the key giants that have been at the forefront of improving salaries for their frontline workers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the\xa010 Most Underpaid Jobs in America.\xa0', 'The sad reality of underpaid jobs in the United States is a pressing issue that continues to persist despite being a long-standing concern. This problem affects millions of hardworking individuals struggling to make ends meet, reflecting a broader systemic issue within the American labor market. Low-wage jobs, often concentrated in industries like retail, fast food, and caregiving, pay meager salaries that do not adequately cover the basic cost of living. These underpaid workers, who are frequently essential to our society, deserve fair compensation for their labor.\xa0', 'In 2023, the US economy faces a deeper crisis than inflation. While inflation may be tackled at the potential cost of a recession, the more significant issue lies in transforming the economy into an oligopoly that sidelines most of its population. This trend has far-reaching consequences for American society and calls for a more comprehensive approach to address economic inequality and empower most citizens. Speaking of income inequality, there also exists a large number of overpaid jobs. For example, there is a strong consensus in the US that CEOs of most corporations have the most overpaid jobs in America.\xa0', 'Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) recently invested $1 billion in increasing hourly wages for its frontline workers, even as its sales outlook for 2023 appeared flat due to decreased consumer spending on home improvement products post-pandemic. The company believes this investment will improve its industry-leading position and help capture more market share. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is not alone in prioritizing its workers’ pay; Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) had set a new wage range of $15 to $24 an hour for its employees, while Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) raised its minimum hourly wage to $14, with an average wage of $17.50 an hour.\xa0', ""This decision to improve salaries can be directly linked to the efficiency wage theory, which suggests that paying higher than minimum wages can lead to increased productivity, employee retention, customer satisfaction, and goodwill compared to competitors. Such investments may eventually result in a more loyal and engaged workforce. While the immediate impact of Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)’s billion-dollar pay raise remains to be seen, the company's CEO, Ted Decker, emphasized that it is an investment in taking care of associates, who, in turn, take care of customers.\xa0"", ""Apart from salary improvements, Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is currently offering over 150 remote job opportunities at their corporate offices in Atlanta, Georgia, with salaries reaching up to $190,000 per year. These positions span from entry-level to managerial roles, primarily in the technology department, including cybersecurity analysts and software engineers. Requirements vary but generally include 2-5 years of relevant work experience and at least a bachelor's degree. In addition to competitive salaries, Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) employees enjoy benefits like pay bonuses, paid parental leave, and discounts on shopping, groceries, and electronics.\xa0"", 'Speaking of remote jobs, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is maintaining a flexible hybrid work model for its corporate employees, allowing them to choose a ""flex your day"" approach instead of mandating a full return to the office. While managers can set specific requirements for their teams, employees have the freedom to decide whether to work in the office or remotely on a hybrid schedule. This approach is in stark contrast to companies like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), which are implementing strict return-to-office mandates.', ""According to our research, underpaid jobs aren't confined to non-technical sectors; even in technology, disparities exist. High-demand roles like software developers command higher wages due to a shortage of qualified professionals, while entry-level or technical support positions offer comparatively lower pay. Before diving into the list, let's explore what the situation for tech roles looks like today.\xa0"", 'In 2022, tech salaries in the US witnessed an average increase of around 7%, as there was an increase in demand after the pandemic. However, this salary rise is different across the tech sector. Certain specialized areas like Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, and cloud engineering are experiencing higher wage increases due to limited supply.', 'Also see Industries Being Revolutionized by Ai and Automation Technologies.\xa0', "" In contrast, job postings in tech saw a considerable decline, totaling just 204,400 in August 2023, less than a third of the postings for the same period in 2022. While salaries are up in specific instances, there's a broader trend of tech workers having reduced bargaining power.\xa0"", 'Moreover, 2023 observed a tech recession as the tech industry lost almost 100,000 jobs in the first half of 2023. Despite these fluctuations, tech employees are placing increasing importance on factors beyond salary, such as career development, work-life balance, and remote work options. To read more about remote jobs, check out our article about best work-from-home jobs in 2023.', 'a katz / Shutterstock.com', 'For our list of the most underpaid jobs in America, we have tried to include jobs perceived as “thankless”, “undervalued,” or “highly under-compensated for the value they bring or add to society”. We understand that these phrases are subjective, not truly quantifiable and depend on the perception of the individual in question. Hence, after reading several Reddit threads related to such jobs, we have tried to give an overall score to the level of being underpaid. The jobs listed have a mix of all the above indicators, and the scoring is based on consensus out of a total score of 60. A higher score indicates a higher consensus about the job being underpaid.\xa0', 'Here is a list of the most underpaid jobs in America.', 'IM Score: 20', ""People often believe door-to-door salespeople are underpaid owing to their job's challenging and often thankless nature, which can involve rejection, long and tiring hours, and low base salaries, leading to the perception that their compensation needs to be improved."", 'IM Score: 21', 'According to BLS, the annual mean wage of hosts and hostesses is $28,380 which is way lower than the minimum wage in the US.

These workers often have unpredictable schedules, part-time employment, and inadequate access to healthcare and other essential benefits.', 'IM Score: 39', 'Machinists and die makers’ jobs require exceptional training and precision. Despite this, their wages may not match the level of expertise, especially when compared to the demands of the job, like operating complex machinery and working with tight schedules while ensuring product quality.', 'IM Score: 40', 'The job is primarily composed of women, many of whom are minorities and lack access to higher education, Moreover, the high cost of childcare services leaves little room for increased wages, as parents are already financially strained.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Navient?', ""For Navient, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Navient would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering a surprise of -7.89%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements."", ""The modest 1.4% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. In contrast revenue growth of 4.9% per year is probably viewed as evidence that CSX is growing, a real positive.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of CSX, it has a TSR of 49% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""CSX provided a TSR of 11% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 8% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time.

Growth isn’t expected to continue at such a torrential pace but should grow at nearly 8% annually through 2028.\xa0', 'So, where does Life Time Group Holdings fit into the picture?

That said, most of the opportunity for price appreciation from CTRE stock derives from its dividend. I won’t go deep into a discussion about its dividend, but it hasn’t been reduced since 2014. That suggests relative safety among REITs as many have reduced their dividends since then.', 'In order to judge the health of CTRE and its dividend we can’t look at a simple payout ratio.

Today, I will first highlight our third quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st Century Security, designed to support the U.S. Department of Defense Strategy of Integrated deterrents and then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on Page 3 of the slides."", 'Sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 million. EPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our Board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS and free cash flow.', 'Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17.', ""At that point, one of the following could occur. FY '24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY '24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. And we will press on with executing our 21st Century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrents and expanding our international business and operations."", 'Turning to the F-35 program. We delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration. We are producing F-35s at a rate of 156 per year, and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR3 software development testing. And we recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades such as improved RADAR, next-gen distributed aperture system and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024.', ""The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first four locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the U.S. State Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced that we'll buy an additional 25 F-35, which will add a third squadron and increased its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense, as their strategic partner for their Air 6500 program Phase 1."", 'This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All Domain Operations, JADO in the free world, and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian defense force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea and cyber domains, we expect that Air 6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide. This proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enables significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program.', 'This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy.', ""Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1 LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in-flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability."", 'In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSC missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1 LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSC. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future.', ""International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong. As demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSCs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another longstanding major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents."", ""The TRIDENT II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid."", ""After a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-REx. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?"", ""Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses."", ""On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy."", 'Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15 through 17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina.', ""The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon. Today's latest version, the Block 772 will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within tactical strike missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments."", ""Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production launch as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record."", 'This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, fleet ballistic missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million transport layer tranche two award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking.', ""With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario."", ""These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress."", ""On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And at free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth and free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first three quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow."", ""We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A."", 'See also The 30 Most Underpaid Jobs in America and 16 Best Investing Podcasts in 2023.', 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.', 'Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Doug.', ""Doug Harned: I wanted to see if - just could I understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now the TR3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have like total confidence in that time frame. And what I'm trying to understand is as you continue to produce F-35s, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenue should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production recognition of revenues, earnings and cash flow, should that date move around, how should we think about the timing here?"", ""Jay Malave: So Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. And so that will - could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15 to 17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15 to 17 than we did on Lot 12 through 14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one."", 'Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', ""Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Jay, I think recently, you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for '24. But I think one of the issues that kind of you mentioned has been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that impacts could impact next year? And any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins? Thank you."", ""Jay Malave: Sure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really - it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins."", ""So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that - as far as any others, look, we - if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024."", ""Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force filed experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there."", 'Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', ""Kristine Liwag: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35 and current partners like Israel, have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?"", ""Jim Taiclet: So Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our Joint Program Office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the Joint Program Office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other..."", ""Jay Malave: Yes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer."", 'Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.', ""George Shapiro: Yes. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%? And I'll sneak in one other one, which is in RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur? Thanks."", ""Jay Malave: Okay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are - and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery - program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%."", 'Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein.', 'Jim Taiclet: Lois, are you still there?', ""Operator: Yes. One moment. We're opening his line. I'm sorry, the next person that we will go to is David Straus from Barclays. Please go ahead."", 'David Strauss: Hi, good morning, everyone.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning, David.', ""David Strauss: Jay, I think the IRS came up with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I want to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it's supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of - or a higher associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns? Thanks."", ""Jay Malave: Sure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension, I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year."", ""We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of two things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since - from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contribution, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025."", ""And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point."", 'Operator: The next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', ""Ken Herbert: Yes, hi. Good morning, Jay and Jim. Maybe, Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal '24 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the '24 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact me? Maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment?"", ""Jay Malave: Sure. So year-to-date, 0we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there."", ""But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean. It does - you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase."", ""Operator: The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard, and he's from Vertical Research. Please go ahead."", 'Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Rob.', ""Rob Stallard: A question for Jim or Jay. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing U.S. budget uncertainty and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?"", ""Jay Malave: It's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last two years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year."", 'Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.', 'Richard Safran: Thanks. Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you?', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning.', ""Richard Safran: So if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume to get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year is, what was - how you see backlog growth and the book-to-bill is better than 1?"", ""Jay Malave: Richard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024."", 'Richard Safran: Thanks.', 'Jay Malave: Welcome.', 'Operator: The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu: Can you guys hear me?', 'Jim Taiclet: Yes. We can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning.', ""Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask Jim and Jay, you're a pretty confident management team just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed given the backdrop is seemingly better, is it just a budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you can just comment on that."", ""Jay Malave: Well, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We - I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis since starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January."", ""Jim Taiclet: In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly. And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time."", ""And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term."", 'Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.', 'Seth Seifman: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning.', 'Jay Malave: Good morning.', ""Seth Seifman: Maybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year, did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of solid rocket motors, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs? Thanks."", ""Jim Taiclet: I'll talk to solid rocket motors and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important."", ""So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on."", ""Jay Malave: On the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental. Pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January."", 'Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.', ""Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Jay, a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're seeing on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? Or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talked about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years?"", ""Jim Taiclet: So digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like Defense of Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD."", ""So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future."", ""Jay Malave: Okay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year."", 'Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Noah Poponak: Hello, everyone.', 'Jim Taiclet: Good morning.', 'Jay Malave: Hi.', ""Noah Poponak: Jay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins, and you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year next year or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses? And then I just wondered if you could talk about how - a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs here with prices fixed a little while ago. Was - is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you - my understanding is you also no bid missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor? Or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?"", ""Jay Malave: Well, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really two different programs. I think you're referring to the standard Stand-in Attack Weapon award, and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively."", ""And hence, we're starting - we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are - this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the - we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me."", ""Jim Taiclet: And Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take - we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program, this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done. We would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things."", 'Maria Ricciardone Lee: Okay. And Lois, I think we have time for one more as we approach the top of the hour.', 'Operator: Thank you so much. And that question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.', ""Jason Gursky: Yes. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you would do us a favor, just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplemental, what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all? And then Jay, related to international here, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else be equal, see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business? Thanks."", ""Jim Taiclet: Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government, what, when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles."", ""So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine."", ""Jay Malave: And on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited - at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS."", ""Maria Ricciardone Lee: All right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts."", ""Jim Taiclet: Sure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well."", 'So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.', 'Operator: Thank you.

Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company’s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.', 'About Snap-on', 'Snap-on Incorporated is a leading global innovator, manufacturer, and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks including those working in vehicle repair, aerospace, the military, natural resources, and manufacturing.

For having a detailed look at the top video conferencing stocks, head over to 5 Best Video Conferencing Stocks to Invest In.', 'The arrival of the pandemic at the end of 2019 forced a lot of companies to shut down their offices and move towards digital setups. This was one of the reasons virtual meetings became a norm because people switched to online conferences. As social distancing became a ritual, the only way for companies’ employees was to interact digitally and that’s why video conferencing stocks took a sharp jump during the pandemic.', 'It has now become essential for organizations to shift towards video conferencing in order to retain their productivity and keep the business flowing. From recruitment to selection, video conferencing still has a big adoption rate among firms.', 'One firm that had a huge market boost during the pandemic was Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM). Along with Zoom, a lot of other firms including Microsoft Corporation (NASDQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) saw their video conferencing features go up. The adoption rate was high because digital workplace was becoming one of the widely adopted measures.', ""According to a research study conducted by Nemertes' Workplace Collaboration and shared by TechTarget, 21% of firms said that they experienced enhanced productivity when travel was cut and video conferencing adoption was implemented. Around 42.6% of companies surveyed prefer video communication over face-to-face meetings. Brick and mortar concept is fading and businesses are moving toward digital meetings. Forbes in 2020 predicted that virtual meetings’ adoption rate will rise 77% by 2023. And today the rate is similar to what the Forbes study predicted."", 'Global IT spending is increasing and is expected to be around $4.7 trillion by 2023, as showed by Gartner research. Video conferencing adoption over time is increasing because organizations are in competition against each other and it is important for them to mitigate their expenses and enhance sales. Companies including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:VZ) have spent a lot in IT because of the rapid adoption of video conferencing and a shift to digitalization. However, the start of digital meetings could be traced back to 2003 when Microsoft launched Skype. It was the start of virtual meetups even when Skype was not used as an official communication channel across organizations. At that time, Skype was used as an informal method of communication across countries. Since then, firms have introduced numerous video conferencing tools to retain their digital meetup market share. The arrival of Google Meet also completely changed the way companies interacted as it was widely implemented throughout the globe.', 'Looking ahead, the video conferencing industry is anticipated to reach a market value of about $17 billion by the end of 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 11.9%, according to research led by Fortune Business Insights.', '""The surging demand for remote learning and integration of developed technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cloud technology is expected to drive market growth in the near future,"" Fortune Business Insights further added.', 'In terms of healthcare, the share of video conferencing solutions market is around $87 million in 2023 and its expected to rise with a compound annual growth rate of of 5.5% in the next 10 years.', 'Companies involved in the video conferencing sector should also be focusing on cloud-based adoptions. According to Forbes, the number of firms with multi-cloud practices will increase from 76% to 85% in 2024. The reason is that companies will prefer to utilize real-time data to stay ahead of competition rather than relying on stale information.', 'Considering video conferencing is not fading anytime soon, we decided to take a look at some of the best video conferencing stocks to invest in.

VZ is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results before the opening bell on Oct 24. In the last reported quarter, the telecom giant beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. The company is expected to have recorded lower aggregate revenues year over year despite healthy momentum in the core wireless business, owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment.', ""During the third quarter, Verizon got full access to the 5G C-band spectrum that enabled customers to use a full 160 MHz of spectrum, nearly tripling the 5G bandwidth connectivity. This further helped the company to expand and enhance its 5G Ultra Wideband network, offering greater capacity to accommodate more customers with robust services and higher data speeds. The additional spectrum also enabled Verizon to offer 5G Home broadband and Business Internet services to more customers. These are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.The company is offering various mix-and-match pricing in wireless and home broadband plans that have historically led to increased adoption of 5G devices and premium unlimited plans. Although this is likely to have translated into healthy customer additions, revenues from the Consumer segment are likely to have taken a toll. Our estimate for revenues from the Consumer segment is pegged at $24,008 million, down from $25,840 recorded in third-quarter 2022.In the quarter, Verizon unveiled a new vehicle that delivers a private network, private mobile edge compute, SD-Wan and satellite connectivity to customer locations. Dubbed Mobile Onsite Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), the solution supports both 4G and 5G standalone functionality. It provides scalable, reliable 5G and edge compute that can be managed locally by enterprise and public sector customers for enhanced operational flexibility without any costs entailed in a permanent installation.During the quarter, Verizon successfully completed data and voice sessions over its 5G network using Ericsson's new RedCap-compatible software and MediaTek’s RedCap testing platform. The technology offers an ideal solution for lower-complexity and lower-cost NR devices such as consumer wearables, fitness trackers and mobile medical devices. It also paves the way for enterprise IoT solutions like video surveillance, industrial sensors and smart grids to run more efficiently on Verizon’s 5G network. These are likely to have translated into incremental revenues in the quarter. Our estimate for revenues from the Business segment is pegged at $7,694 million.However, adverse foreign currency translations, infrastructure investments and high operating costs for 5G deployments are likely to have led to soft margins in the quarter. Moreover, the promotional offers and lucrative discounts are expected to have weighed on margins. In addition, the company’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from the voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data and video) offerings by cable companies.Verizon also recorded high capital expenditures for the launch and continued build-out of its 5G Ultra-Wideband network, deployment of significant fiber assets across the country and upgrade to Intelligent Edge Network architecture.For the September quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $33,390 million. It reported revenues of $34,241 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $1.17, which suggests a decline from the year-ago tally of $1.32."", 'Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Verizon for the third quarter.

Upon this news, Citigroup lowered its price target on shares of the chipmaker. Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the restrictions and how Nvidia will work under those restrictions.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""JOSH LIPTON: AI darling Nvidia hits a speed bump after the Biden administration announces plans to halt shipments of select AI chips to China from American companies, like NVIDIA. Citi subsequently lowering its target price on the chip maker. Here with all the details is Yahoo Finance's own Josh Schafer. Josh."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Josh. You set it off the top there. Nvidia might be caught up in these new chip regulations from the Biden administration, specifically, of course, bringing AI chips to China. They might not be able to do that as well. And Citi flagging that as a concern for the company. I think anyone that understands how Nvidia works as a company, how big AI has been for them. And of course, they are a chip maker. So if they're not able to bring as many chips to China and sell them there, you could see how that could be a topline issue for Nvidia."", ""But I think important to point out here, Citi not downgrading the stock from, say, a buy to a hold, but really just moving that price target down from, you see there on your screen, from $630 to $575. We should note that's still a well above where Nvidia is trading today at $421. So still seeing some upside. And that's really because of Nvidia's overall AI demand."", ""Nvidia noted in an 8-K filing last night that they think their AI demand is going to help them basically overcome this headwind. You have seen the stock down pretty significantly over the last five days. You can see on your screen there, down about 10%. But I think a lot of that might just be more to do with Nvidia's run-up in the year. You look at Nvidia year-to-date, this has been, as we said off the top, an AI darling. The stock has soared nearly 200% this year."", ""So any little sign to maybe take some gains off the table for investors isn't necessarily surprising to see. Of course, we'll learn a lot more about how Nvidia feels about these new regulations when they report earnings toward the end of tech earnings, you know, in about a month or so here, a month and a half. But for now, it seems like this is just a headwind that NVIDIA understands exists. The overall scope of it, I don't think we have a clear idea on just yet."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Josh Schafer, thank you for that.']"

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Core income of $454 million for the quarter benefited from very strong underlying underwriting results and net investment income but was also impacted by elevated catastrophe losses and net unfavorable prior year reserve development. Mike will provide more context on the catastrophe losses. The unfavorable prior year reserve development was driven by the results of our annual asbestos review in our runoff book. The reserves in the ongoing businesses of all three segments developed favorably. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Underlying underwriting income of $868 million pretax was up more than 40% over the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $9.7 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 90.6%. The underlying combined ratios in our commercial segments remained excellent. Our Business Insurance segment once again delivered very strong results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.7%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was also excellent at 80.7%. Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was 88.3% for the quarter, among our best ever. In our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved more than 5 points to 94.2% as a strong written rate from prior quarters is earning in. Our underlying results in Personal Insurance are improving and heading in the right direction. Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well, generating after-tax net investment income of $640 million, reflecting strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and solid returns from our nonfixed income portfolio. In terms of production, thanks to great execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value they have to sell. We grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.5 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 16% to $5.1 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was very strong at 12.9%, driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated year-over-year and sequentially to 7.9%. Renewal rate change was higher sequentially in every line other than workers' comp, where overall renewal premium change remains positive and appropriate given returns in the line. For the segment, even with higher pricing at record levels, retention remained very strong at 87%, a reflection of a rational market. New business was strong and hired broadly across the segment. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums to a record $1 billion, achieved 91% retention of our high-quality Management Liability business and grew net written premiums in our industry-leading Surety business by 13%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 14% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.4% in our homeowners and other business increased to a record high 18.2% in our auto business. Another quarter of strong production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. With the end of the year in sight and 2024 on the horizon and coming into focus, we feel very well positioned for what's ahead and quite confident. In our Business Insurance segment, written margins are expanding. Pricing has been strong and the components of core goods inflation that impact our loss costs are moderating. Medical inflation, in particular, remains benign. Nonetheless, given the duration of relevant liabilities, we continue to incorporate medical inflation and our loss costs based on the higher longer-term trends. In terms of the top line of Business Insurance, we're pleased that economic output and consumption so far remain robust. Given our leading workers' compensation business, we've ended in particular, from the near 50-year low in unemployment, the primates labor participation rate, which is at its highest level since 2007 and ongoing wage inflation, which contributes to premium growth and margins. As a result of strong pricing in recent years and higher fixed income NII, returns in the segment are currently attractive. Nonetheless, given the uncertainty generally in terms of weather volatility, economic and social inflation, hardening reinsurance market and the geopolitical landscape, we plan to continue pursuing strong price increases in both the property and casualty lines to achieve our overtime return objectives. Turning to our industry-leading Bond & Specialty business. We just reached a milestone $1 billion in net written premiums and returns are terrific. And as you've heard, results in our personal insurance business are headed in the right direction. Earned margins are improving and additional price increases will earn in from here. We're very pleased with our targeted marketplace execution. At same time, inflationary pressures are moderating.In terms of the investment portfolio with interest rates at their highest levels in recent memory and most indications suggesting higher for longer, we are extremely well positioned. In the last 5 years, we've grown our very high-quality investment portfolio by nearly $19 billion or about 25% to more than $90 billion. 93% of the portfolio is allocated to fixed income. As we look ahead to 2024, we expect our after-tax fixed income NII will be more than $2.6 billion. To ensure that our competitive advantages continue to distinguish us and fuel our performance. We will continue to invest in our ambitious and focused innovation priorities. We're spending more than $1.5 billion this year on technology, inside an excellent expense ratio and with a higher proportion allocated to strategic technology investments. We're confident that we're working on the right priorities, executing effectively and that will see the benefits play out in growth at attractive returns going forward. Lastly, I'll share that we're recently back from one of the year's largest industry conferences where we met with many of our distribution partners. We left confident that we have the pole position with distribution in the United States and that we're positioned to support each other's strategic and marketplace priorities. We're committed to being their best partner and to offering the products and services that best serve our mutual customers. To sum it up, we remain very confident in the outlook for our business. I couldn't be more grateful to my 30,000 colleagues who show up every day committed to our culture for standard of excellence and fulfilling our mission of creating shareholder value and our purpose of taking care of the people we're privileged to serve. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $454 million and core return on equity was 6.9% as heavy cat activity impacted our results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6%, a 1.9-point improvement from last year's strong results. This combination of growth and underlying margin improvement led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $684 million after tax, up $206 million or 43% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter improved 10 basis points from last year's quarter to an excellent 28% and continues to reflect the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. Our third quarter results include $850 million of pretax catastrophe losses, resulting from another quarter of both frequency and severity of weather across North America. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net unfavorable development of $154 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $263 million was driven by charges in our runoff business, including $284 million related to our annual asbestos review, as well as increased reserves for abuse and molestation resulting from the volume of claims related to the closing of the reviver window in California. This year's asbestos charge includes an additional increase to strengthen our carried reserve position relative to the range of outcomes. Outside of runoff in our ongoing businesses, Business Insurance had $132 million of net favorable PYD driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by unfavorability in Commercial Auto. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $72 million was driven by another quarter of better-than-expected results in both Surety and Management Liability. Personal Insurance had $37 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After-tax net investment income of $640 million was up 27% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also above the prior year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher during the third quarter, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to approximately $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter. For 2024, we now expect more than $2.6 billion after tax, our highest level ever, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter of 2024 and growing to approximately $690 million for the fourth quarter. New money rates as of September 30 are about 180 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of more than $3 billion were an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than our target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $4.6 billion after tax at June 30, to $6.5 billion after tax at September 30. As we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally did not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.78 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $333 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $101 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6.1 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Similar to my comments on last quarter's call, a significant level of catastrophe losses we've experienced this year resulted in lower year-to-date earnings than we expected, so share repurchases in the fourth quarter will likely be lower than the quarterly share repurchases made in the first half of the year. To sum things up, while our third quarter earnings were adversely impacted by elevated catastrophe losses, we're pleased to post another quarter of double-digit premium growth and improved and very strong underlying combined ratio and further improvement in our outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our business results going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Thanks, Dan. Segment income for the third quarter was $468 million, with strong underlying underwriting and investment income as well as favorable prior year development in our ongoing book, offset by reserve charges in our runoff book, mostly related to asbestos. We're particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 89.7% for the quarter, which was a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year and an all-time best third quarter result. The benefit of earned pricing was offset by normal variability in loss activity, all in netting to an excellent result. Net written premiums increased 16% to a record third quarter of $5.1 billion, driven by very strong renewal premium change of 12.9%, historically high retention of 87% and new business of $695 million. Underneath RPC, as you heard from Alan, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the second quarter to 7.9% with all lines other than workers' comp being higher. We're thrilled with these production results and our fields continued superior execution in the marketplace. And given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases, improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. Lastly, we're encouraged that new business was higher than the prior year quarter broadly across the segment. While the comparison of new business to the prior year quarter benefited from a relatively modest prior year result as well as higher pricing on new business this year. We're also pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 10.3%, while retention of 85% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter. New business was up $46 million from the prior year quarter, driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. We're also encouraged with the early performance of our new state-of-the-art Commercial Auto product, which has been rolled out in 12 states. In middle market, renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, while retention remained excellent at 89%. New business was a strong $352 million. We're pleased with the quality of the submission flow from our distribution partners during the quarter and our responsiveness in quoting and closing accounts that align with our appetite. As always, we remain vigilant around risk selection, underwriting and pricing. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial results while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Peter Klenk', ""Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted terrific top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income was a record $265 million, up 10% from the very strong prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 80.7%. Turning to the top line. We're pleased to have delivered record net written premiums of over $1 billion. In domestic Management Liability, we again delivered record-level retention of 91%, up 2 points from the third quarter of 2022 while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. This result reflects the attractive returns of our high-quality book of business. Record Surety net written premiums reflect strong broad-based demand for surety bonds and higher premium from large construction projects. So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization and the benefits from our value-added approach and market-leading competitive advantages. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael."", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the third quarter segment loss of $193 million was significantly impacted by catastrophe losses. We experienced elevated losses from weather activity, specifically related to wind and hail events. This was another active quarter for severe convective storms across the U.S. There were 19 designated PCS events specifically related to wind, hail and tornado activity in the quarter, nearly twice the 10-year average and the highest number for a third quarter in more than a decade.On a more positive note, the underlying combined ratio of 94.2% improved 5.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting an improvement in both automobile and homeowners. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 14%, driven by high teens renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners and other.In automobile, the third quarter combined ratio was 103.5%. This was 8.7 points lower than the prior year quarter, which included catastrophe losses resulting from Hurricane Ian. The underlying combined ratio of 100.6% and improved 3.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in our results clearly reflects the growing impact of our pricing and non-rate actions. Underlying results in auto are headed in the right direction as the benefit of earned pricing continues to accelerate and as vehicle repair and replacement trends are moderating. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2023, it's important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been 6 to 7 points above the average for the first 3 quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving. In homeowners and other, the third quarter combined ratio of 116.2% increased 13.9 points due to the catastrophe losses that I mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 88% improved 6.9 points, primarily due to the impact of earned pricing, a benefit from the favorable reestimation of prior quarters in the current year and a lower expense ratio. Turning to production. Our results continue to demonstrate our disciplined market execution in a challenging marketplace. Beginning with domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change of 19.4% was very strong. The lack of growth in policies in force reflects our continued actions to further balance rate adequacy, catastrophe risk and regulatory risk. We expect renewal premium change in homeowners to remain consistent through year-end. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect renewal premium change to remain elevated, but moderate into low double digits as our automatic increase in limit factors returned to more normal levels in line with stabilizing industry estimates of replacement costs. In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 18.2% increased 2 points compared to the second quarter of 2023. Auto policies in force declined slightly, reflecting our continued efforts to manage growth while improving profitability. Going forward, we expect renewal premium change in auto to remain very strong but begin to move down from here as more of the book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis. I'm proud of the way our team continues to respond to the dynamic environment. We are consistently evolving pricing, segmentation, underwriting and terms and conditions, while managing new business flow to ensure we deploy capacity thoughtfully in the face of market dislocation. At the same time, we're sustaining our investments and capabilities to build our business for the future. With our leading talent, capabilities and strong distribution relationships, we are confident in our ability to generate leading returns over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."", 'Abbe F. Goldstein', ""Thanks, Michael. And operator, we're ready to start questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.', 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""Well, good morning, everyone. I guess my first question will focus on Business Insurance. I think you guys have now reported something like 14 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in the underlying combined ratio. I guess what I'm -- where I'm going with this is just what is your longer-term target with your UCR, especially in light of what we're seeing in the accelerating renewal rate trend? And -- maybe if you don't want to answer it that way, maybe you can triangulate for us just how the renewal rate change, which is accelerating matches up with your inflation expectations and your insurance to value initiatives?"", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""A lot in that question, Greg. It's Alan, there's a lot in that question. I think you're right for starters. I don't think we're going to give you our targets or objectives. I think it gets too close to something it's competitively sensitive in terms of our pricing strategies. But I guess I'd point you toward where renewal premium change is, which is at record levels. And frankly, I always hate to get into the commentary on loss trend because as I've shared before, to take a single metric to define what's going on across billions of dollars premium implies a level of precision that doesn't exist. Every line has got its own dynamics, so on and so forth. But there wasn't a lot of change in sort of the profile of loss activity this past quarter. So we continue to have a pretty meaningful gap between where renewal premium changes and where loss trends are. And so I think that gives you a sense. It's why we are -- it's easy enough in my prepared remarks to share that written margins are expanding."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.', 'David Kenneth Motemaden', 'Just a follow-up question on the BI underlying loss ratio. Greg, you had said that the benefit of earned pricing was offset by normal variability in loss activity. I was wondering if you could just size those components, and it sounded like non-cat weather was maybe a little bit elevated relative to normal expectations, but wondering if you could just break that down for us.', 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""David, it's Dan. I think we're not going to go any further. I think what Greg said is really the way to think about it, which is as Alan just mentioned, we've been getting a good level of written price increase, that's earning its way through. So there is still definitely a benefit from earned pricing. In any given quarter, you got a handful of things that are going to go one way or the other that could be small weather, that could be base year, it could be mix changes, it could be just variability from one quarter to next. There were some good guys and some bad guys, nothing particularly significant and net result, just about offset the benefit from earned price. And again, all of inside of an underlying combined ratio that we're really happy with it sub-90%."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""I was hoping to get more color on the reserve development that you guys called out in your ongoing businesses within Business Insurance. You could tell us what the workers' comp favorability. And then I think you called out Commercial Auto developed adversely. Could we get the numbers there? And then are there any other lines in your ongoing business that moved materially in the quarter?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Yes, Lisa, it's Dan. So sorry, I'll disappoint you that we're not going to do the line by line. But comp has been pretty strongly favorable. It was pretty strongly favorable again this quarter. In our remarks, we try to call out the lines that had noteworthy movement. This quarter, Commercial Auto did have some noteworthy movement. It wasn't dramatic, particularly in the scope of you think about the size of the reserves for the Commercial Auto book. And what we saw in Commercial Auto this quarter is a little bit of a lengthening of the development patterns, not a terrifically new theme, but every quarter, we're looking at all the data that comes in. This gave us an indication that maybe reserves should be carried a little higher than we were, and we're just trying to react to that in real time as quickly as possible. Those were -- there were some movement in the other lines, some good guys and some bad guys, nothing particularly noteworthy, but those were the two main drivers."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', 'And then you guys -- you called out higher cats in the third quarter as well as other quarters this year. Are you guys contemplating making any changes to your reinsurance program heading into 2024? How do you think, I guess, changes you made over the past year could have led to higher cats this year?', 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""So I don't think that the changes we made would have had much of a difference. Obviously, the last few years, we've had that underlying cat aggregate treaty, we didn't attach it at all in 2023. We didn't renew it in 2024. We get that question a couple of times. Just to remind you, in 2023, when we had that underlying cat ag treaty, we placed..."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', '2022.', 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Sorry, 2022. I'm a year into the future already. So 2022, we didn't attach it. We didn't renew it in 2023. Even when we had it last time in '22, we placed about 50% of a $500 million layer. So it couldn't have been more than $250 million of recovery and it cost us a lot to have that policy. Rate online was very high for that coverage. We said in July 1 that we'd enter into a new PI-specific coastal reinsurance treaty. I think we'll just continue to evaluate our position and what's available to us in the marketplace from a reinsurance perspective as we look forward to 2024. But I'd say what we sort of regularly say, which is we're really pleased with our risk selection. We think we do a great job of segmentation and pricing. We're going to probably keep more net than many of our peers because at the end of the day, we like our underwriting."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.', 'Ryan James Tunis', 'First question is just from Michael. In terms of homeowners, that clearly seems like a line that probably needs more rate, not less, just given where cat trends have been. But you mentioned in your prepared remarks that we might see some premium growth deceleration because of what you referred to as automatic increase in limits. It sounded like that might have been about half of renewal premium growth. Can you just I guess, mechanically help us understand a little bit more what that increase in limits is tied to? And in the absence of that, what are some other means by which you can get more price in that line?', 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Sure, Ryan. Thanks for the question. So just unpacking it for a second, right? So inside RPC in homeowners, there's really two primary components. There's rate and then there's exposure or other RPC, which primarily is the additional premium we collect due to the coverage A limit, the dwelling limit on the home going up. And over the past 2 years, we've increased coverage A amounts significantly to keep up with higher replacement cost trends that have been occurring sort of across the industry. And given those outsized increases in coverage A amounts over the last couple of years, as we take a look at our external data and information about where replacement costs are today and where trends are, we are largely caught up with that increase. And so we don't see a need for coverage A amounts to move dramatically north from here in the near term. So that premium that we would -- that we have been collecting because coverages As have been rising, won't be as nearly as big an element of renewal premium change in '24 as it was in '22 and '23. That said, to your point, clearly, the homeowners line continues to need great. It continues to need profit improvement, and we will continue to seek higher rate in homeowners even though the limit increases will be subsiding. The other thing I'd point to is part of the answer in home is pricing. Another big piece of the answer is non-rate actions. And we've been very active in the marketplace across risk selection, payroll by apparel pricing, tighter eligibility, stricter terms and conditions to drive profit improvement in the property line as well."", 'Ryan James Tunis', ""Got it. And then just a follow-up on just Business Insurance retention. It's interesting, like how robust that's been. Clearly, we're seeing personal lines retention come off as I would think you'd expect when you're taking rate. Just -- what do you guys make of that? Like why has retention been still robust, I guess, despite so many rounds of rate increases?"", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Ryan, this is Greg. I think we start every month with retaining our high-quality book of business. So it's been very much an intentional strategy of ours to make sure that we're being thoughtful on our terms and conditions, our pricing and all the changes that we're making to continuously improve margins. But given the quality of that book, it's not a surprise for us.It also is a an indicator of just how rational the marketplace is right now and the need for improved margins across the entire industry based on all those headwinds that Alan talked about. So we're not surprised by it. We're very pleased with it, and we're very focused on it."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Bhullar from JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""So first, I just had a question on Commercial Auto. And if you could just give us a little bit more insight into what's driving the adverse development there. Some of your peers have seen that as well, and I think there are some concerns that this could be sort of the beginning of a trend given what's gone on in Personal Auto over the past 2 years or so?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Jimmy, it's Dan again. So yes, as we said a little while ago, Commercial Auto is really just a modification based on the most recent data that's come in, in terms of the development of claims in Commercial Auto, particularly bodily injury claims. This is something that we've commented on and off probably over the last 3 or 4 quarters. Numbers have been pretty modest, the themes are not inconsistent with what we anticipated. But to get a new set of data and the data looks a little bit different than your prior estimation. And so the magnitude of some of the changes that we anticipated is a little higher. Really the focus of this most recent strengthening is the continued sort of longer development of -- or said inversely the slower closing of claims in Commercial Auto. So as that continues to lag historical closer patterns, we're making an adjustment to reflect the most recent data."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""And that's just a function of repairs taking longer or something else?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""This is more in the bodily injury side of Commercial Auto, so it's not so much repairs themselves, although that's been a factor in both Michael's business and a smaller degree and Greg's business, bodily injury, it's more of the settlement of the injury client."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""And then in Personal Auto, where are you in terms of rate adequacy on a written basis? And is -- your discount has been sort of flattish. Are competitors being fairly rational and you're seeing price increases across the board? Or are there some companies that are not adjusting due to the higher loss trend?"", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Thanks, Jimmy. It's Michael. I would say that when you look at our -- taking the second part of the question first, when you look at our production statistics, retention is down a bit, but it's actually been pretty resilient in the face of the rate we've been driving through the book, particularly given the magnitude of those numbers. And so I think that, that's indicative of a fairly rational market and the fact that these are, again, industry-wide pressures that most competitors are dealing with. In terms of written rate adequacy, again, last quarter, I said we'd get there in the coming quarters. Relative to the comments last quarter, we feel a little bit better sitting here today than we did 90 days ago. Given the record level of RPC that we achieved in the third quarter and the fact that we're seeing loss trends stabilize, and that's coming through in our underlying combined ratio. That said, I would also say that written rate adequacy still depends on the same list of things we talked about last quarter, right? It's the price we get. It's how quickly loss trends moderate and how much they continue to moderate the regulatory process for getting rate approvals and our actual loss experience. But it is, at this point, very much a state-by-state conversation and we're working each state individually and adjusting our actions accordingly."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS Financial.', 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""A couple of one here. First, Jeff answered some questions here. Jeff, on the Management Liability business, I think you mentioned in the quarter that there was some favorable current year development. Maybe we can quantify that and what's going on there with the Management Liability business that you're seeing this favorable development?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Brian, it's Dan. So I think we're not going to put a number -- not a significant deal. The only point Jeff was trying to make is sort of when you do the comparison year-over-year, there was some favorable CYPQ, which we called out last year in the third quarter, there was some favorable CYPQ this year as well, just not as much. So the year-over-year is unfavorable given less of a good guy."", 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And the next question, I'm just curious, bigger picture in Business Insurance. Exposure growth continues to be pretty healthy. Maybe you can give us a little context around what kind of drives that exposure growth. And we think that with the economy moderating some here that exposure will -- growth will start to slow here."", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Yes, Brian, we watch for that all the time. And as you can see in the webcast in the blue lines we give you, you can see it's been very stable across the select business, in the middle market. And obviously, those add to the total BI business. And so it really is a function of nominal GDP economic growth and the overall inflation levels. And clearly, we've seen the consumer type inflation correct somewhat from the peak of mid-2022. Where we're really encouraged when we also look at our audit premium, which is more of a going backward view in our core middle market business, we continue to have real strong audit premium also. So both backwards and forward, we're encouraged with how exposure is playing out in the business, and we'll continue to report out what we see with that line."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO Capital Markets.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""First, on Business Insurance segment. We heard loud and clear the comments about written margins expanding. Is the definition of written margins include reserve changes? Because I'm just trying to -- when we look at the loss ratio, maybe, I guess, ex cat, we clearly see that in the that reserve releases or additions or whatever, right, are worse year-over-year, clearly, margins are good. I'm just trying to -- are you trying to -- does written margins mean -- are you looking kind of forward-looking or backward looking? Any color there."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Mike, it's Dan. So just to clarify for you. So when we're talking about margin and not that context, we're talking about the underlying combined ratio. So leaving to the side catastrophe losses and leaving to the side prior year reserve development. The only other comment I'd make in that regard is when we do see changes in prior year development, we do roll forward our thinking in terms of does that impact our view of current year loss and go-forward loss. But PYD itself, as it's booked, whether it's favorable or unfavorable, is outside of that concept where we're talking about underlying margins."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Okay. Understood. And just a quick follow-up then. Have you changed your view of forward-looking loss after this quarter? And you also called out the topping off of the asbestos and environmental that you think you used were topping off, you kind of called out an additional add. And I don't know if you want to call out specifically what that dollar amount was."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Yes. So I don't think we'll split the asbestos charge beyond that. But what we wanted to get across was we did our sort of traditional deep dive in the third quarter that resulted in a figure for which we would have strengthened the asbestos reserve. We chose also to think about it in simple terms as moving higher in the range of possible outcomes for asbestos. And so we put some money on top of what the analysis otherwise would have told you for the quarter. And then in terms of the first part of the question, we're looking at all the factors that go into loss trend every quarter, including favorable or unfavorable PYD, there are generally small puts and takes on a pretty regular basis, nothing terribly significant in this quarter in terms of our view of loss trend."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies.', 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', ""I guess my first question is on workers' comp. So we saw a premium decline there year-over-year. Are there any onetime items there? Or is it just an indication of market conditions and then maybe rate compression? And maybe you can tie that into how you're viewing this line of business and your thoughts about that into 2024."", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Yes, Yaron. Yes, I think you're referencing the slight down in the net written premium for the quarter. I would point to you that year-to-date, it is just up 2%. So it wasn't a meaningful change for the particular quarter. And obviously, where you're seeing not the level of net written premium growth on the other product lines that we're seeing in workers' comp is clearly the rate pressure that the entire industry is seeing there. That rate pressure is driven based on the bureau's loss cost recommendations that continue to put minuses across the industry, and that's just an indication of the health of the line. We're the largest workers' comp writer in the country. And on a calendar year basis, we feel terrific about the results of that, and that's basically what's driving some of that net written premium change that you've mentioned."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Just to be clear, we feel great about the workers' comp line. We feel great about our results this quarter this year, and we feel great about the outlook."", 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', ""Got it. And then my second question, also on BI. Do you have any CYPQ there? Because I did notice that the underlying loss ratio was flat year-over-year. Just given the rate commentary and RPC commentary, where I thought maybe we'd see a little bit of improvement there."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Yes, Yaron, it's Dan. So a little earlier in the call and in Greg's comments, we called out that, we did see some benefit from earned price. But half a dozen other things that would happen in any quarter, Could be some good guys, could be some bad guys, could be mix, could be base share, could be non-cat weather. There were some favorable and some unfavorable netted to a modest unfavorable to offset the pricing benefit, but nothing significant there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.', 'Jon Paul Newsome', ""I wanted to ask if you could help me think more about the cat load prospectively. And one of the things I was wondering about this may go to the definition to you think about cats, [important,] is if inflation is effectively pushing losses that otherwise in the past, we've not have been cat losses into the cat designation. And that may be how much of that may be part of why the cat load may need to go up? Just any thoughts on that would be great."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', 'Sure, Paul, it\'s Dan. I\'ll start. I think the sort of second piece of the question, the answer would be yes to the degree that some of what we\'ve seen in higher cat losses is the impact of inflation over the last several years and just the value of those claims going up. So yes, over time, more things would fall into what would get designated as ""catastrophes"" given the threshold. Other than that, thinking about cats, we\'re looking at long-term weather trends, medium-term weather trends, near-term weather trends, we\'re putting more weight on nearer-term weather trends. And as both Greg and Michael have talked about trying to react with very strong pricing changes in terms and conditions and risk selection, where we think it\'s appropriate. There is also clearly an uptick in catastrophe activity this year. So last year, I think last quarter, I think, Alan, maybe gave the statistics that in the 91 days of the quarter, there were 88 days in which there was a PCS event occurring. In the third quarter, there were 92 days in the quarter. On 91 of those 92 days, there was a PCS event occurring. So the increase in catastrophes is the combination of several factors. One is there do seem to be more storms more frequently. Two, more people have moved into harm\'s way in terms of where the demographic spread of risk is. And three, inflation has resulted in the impact of those costs being higher.', 'Jon Paul Newsome', 'Is there any way to think about whether or not that would have an impact on the underlying combined ratio? Should you essentially move the same claim to the cat designation from the underlying?', 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Paul, sometimes we do see that in a quarter where it's bucketing, where things will spill over to a cat number that would have otherwise been an underlying -- that was not a big factor this quarter. It's not like there were a bunch of close calls because of inflation spilled over into a cat designation. This was a significantly high number of severe convective storms for the third quarter that created a bunch of catastrophes. So this was not a definitional bucketing close call issue. That does happen sometimes. It didn't happen this quarter."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ward from Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'I was curious about Personal Auto. Just wondering if there was an impact from current year reserves on the underlying result. And if you could maybe expand on the frequency and severity trends.', 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Sure, Michael. It's Michael. In terms of CYPQ, not a significant amount. I mean, we called out the earned impact of pricing that really is the driver of the improvement in underlying. And then as respect to frequency and severity, frequency largely coming in, in line with expectations. If you look at external indices, miles driven is up 2% to 3%. It's pretty consistent with the trend it's been on. And so not a lot to talk about on the frequency side and then really the moderating trends that I described are really coming from severity as we continue to see, in particular, physical damage severity moderate quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter as we go through 2023."", 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""And then on commercial property. Just wondering how should we think about the impact of the growth on BI margins? And could it -- if there's more volatility in non-cat property might that affect your growth appetite next year."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Mike, it's Dan. So I think we're very aware and cognizant of the amount of property that we're putting on the books where we're putting it on the books and what that's doing to our total exposures price property with the risk load given the uncertainty and variability that can come with it. In terms of the margin from how much property you're writing there can be a mix change over time if you think about the relative loss ratios of the lines and some of that's driven by the duration of the liability in the lines property historically tends to run a lower underlying loss ratio than, for example, workers' comp. So you could get a mix change over time. Tell me if that's not responsive to your question."", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""The one thing I'd add to that also is when you look at our property growth, the thrust of that growth really is being driven based on rate and exposure change we're being active and very selective on the new business front. But when you look at what's driving the net written premium change, it does start with rate and exposure change."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', 'And strong retention.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW.', 'Meyer Shields', ""So a question to start for Jeff. We've seen G&A expenses rise significantly faster than written premium every quarter this year. And I'm hoping you could talk to what's going on there."", 'Jeffrey Peter Klenk', ""Absolutely. This is Jeff. Thanks, Meyer. The question on expenses is we're definitely making strategic investments to support our future success. And broadly speaking, I'd give you two buckets. It's employees and it's also technology investments and think platform. But I remind you all in the context of while we're delivering attractive returns."", 'Meyer Shields', ""Yes, that's fair. No, that's very helpful. Second question, and I'm obviously shooting a little bit in the dark, but it looks like last year and this year, the run rate of workers' compensation reserve releases was a lot higher than preceding years. And I was hoping you could talk through what that change is? Is it just COVID-related frequency benefit or are there other factors?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Meyer, it's Dan. Comp has been pretty consistently for a number of years, a pretty favorable development story. And when it is, it's across a number of accident years. That's continued to be the case in 2022 and 2023. We're really just reacting to -- we've had this conversation before. You've got to be really careful with your assumption around medical cost trend given the duration of the liability, quarter goes by a bunch of claims closed. You see what actually happened in terms of severity relative to what you had previously allowed for and you make an adjustment. And we're really just following the numbers in that regard. We have -- we've certainly not become any more aggressive in the way we're reserving for workers' comp. It's just the mathematical output of the changes that we've seen."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.', 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""First one I have for you is on casualty. And specifically, I wanted to ask you about some of the comments that have come out of the larger reinsurance companies. I mean it sounds like they've gotten a bit more cautious in their stance on U.S. casualty in general and I guess the social inflation trends and so forth. And certainly, you guys -- it sounds like you saw a little bit of that in general liability and commercial lines. But I just wanted to see if you could provide a perspective on how big of an issue do you really think that is for the industry at this point? And is there anything unique about your exposure that sort of insulates you, whether it's the size of business that you tend to write and that kind of thing."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Yes. Alex, it's Alan. We think that commentary is well placed. And frankly, we've been on that bandwagon since, I don't know, 2018 or something like that. So we think we rang that bell very, very early. We think we've reacted to it consistently even during the pandemic when you might have looked at the data and thought that things were improving. We've said consistently, we don't believe it. We think it's here. We think it's at higher levels. We think it's inflate faster.And so what we've seen is inside the underlying -- the combined ratios that we're reporting in Business Insurance. So we do think that it continues to be an important issue to watch. And we've taken a lot of price and in part in response to that. So it's an issue and we think we're on top of it."", 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""Got it. And a follow-up I had is on the auto insurance specifically. You all obviously showed a good amount of improvement, which is great to see. How much of that is driven by the severity beginning to calm down or stabilizing at least. I mean any color you can provide on those trends and maybe specifically even repair and what you're seeing there?"", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Sure, Alex, it's Michael. I'll just clarify a couple of things I said earlier. So it really is the acceleration of earned pricing earning through and driving that underlying improvement. But when you think about the external trends, and external cost, it definitely is also a result of those external trends moderating. And we had been talking about double-digit loss cost trends, particularly in the physical damage space for a quarter upon quarter upon quarter, those trends moved into the single digit this quarter. So it was really both the earned pricing and the moderating trends driving that improvement."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Scott Gregory Heleniak', ""Just wondering if you could comment on the recent proposed reforms in the state of California really to keep private insurers from -- in the state from leaving the state. Do you think that initiatives there are appropriate? Do you think they're enough? And does that impact your strategy there either way in either direction? Just any overall kind of first views on some of the proposals out there?"", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Sure, Scott. It's Michael. I'll share a couple of thoughts. First of all, the idea of regulatory reform in California is positive news. That said, I really don't think there are enough details available to evaluate. You've got a framework that the governor has asked the commissioner to take action on, but the details underneath that framework and how it's going to be implemented have yet to be defined. And so deciding whether it's a net positive or not and what actions to take as a result there just really aren't enough details yet to evaluate that further. But we certainly are encouraged by the fact that California is considering regulatory reform, and we think it's long overdue."", 'Operator', 'And we have time for one more question, Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley.', 'Jian Huang', ""Most of my questions were answered, but maybe just one thing. You mentioned on the prepared remarks about tech investments. Can you possibly unpack that a little bit what are the key technological aspect that you're focusing on in terms of investment? I'm assuming cloud is always going to be a big part of your investment just given that there is a consumption-based expense model. But are there other IT capabilities that you would like to call out?"", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Yes. So Bob, it's Alan. Thank you for the question. We would be really happy to take this offline with you. We've talked really extensively about this over a long period of time. But broadly, the investments that we're making across the organization fall into three buckets: one, extending our lead in risk expertise; two, providing great experiences to our customers, agents, brokers and employees; and three, optimizing productivity and efficiency. And that happens in a lot of different ways at the enterprise level, and it happens segment by segment. But at the enterprise, broadly speaking, it's digitizing the value chain. Digitizing the customer journey, modernizing the foundation, advanced analytics, automation, faster speed to market, getting the right price on the risk, things like that. And in terms of what's going on in the businesses, it's partner integration, sales and service, better front end for customers. It's on and on. It's focused and it's ambitious. But it also covers a lot of ground. So we've talked a lot about it extensively, and we'd be happy to meet with the insure more."", 'Jian Huang', ""Okay. And maybe just like a follow-up on workers' comp and apologies for belaboring the point on this. Is that possible to maybe unpack a little bit in terms of how the loss ratio looks like for workers' comp versus other parts of Business Insurance. I'm assuming this does not impact your loss cost trend of 5.5% to 6%, but just curious as to if you can give a little bit of detail there."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Yes, we're not going to break out the losses by product line, but it certainly is wrapped in the overall number that we've talked about historically."", 'Operator', 'Ms. Abbe Goldstein, I will turn the call back over to you.', 'Abbe F.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Genuine Parts in Focus', ""Genuine Parts (GPC) is headquartered in Atlanta, and is in the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The stock has seen a price change of -13.43% since the start of the year. The auto and industrial parts distributor is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.95 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.53%. This compares to the Automotive - Replacement Parts industry's yield of 1.1% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.7%."", ""Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.80 is up 6.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Genuine Parts has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.69%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Genuine Parts's payout ratio is 43%, which means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'GPC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well.

However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our purpose, mission and operating principles on Slide 3. I would like to thank our more than 22,000 M&T colleagues for all their hard work, whether serving our customers or our communities, our employees continue to deliver on our purpose, making a difference in people's lives. This purpose drives our operating principles. We believe in local scale, that is combining local knowledge and hands-on customer service of Community Bank with the resources of a large financial institution. Our 28 communities are led by on-the-ground regional presidents. Their knowledge allows us to better understand and meet the needs of our customers and communities. And importantly, this approach continues to produce strong results for our shareholders. Our local scale has led to superior credit performance, top deposit share and high operating and capital efficiency over the long term.Moving to Slide 4. Our seasoned talent and diverse board are keys to gaining in-depth understanding of our customers' needs and expectations. We have sound technology solutions, coupled with caring employees, which provide a differentiated client experience.Please turn to Slide 5. This slide showcases how we activate our purpose through our operating principles. When our customers and communities succeed, we all succeed. Our investment in enhancing the customer experience and delivering impactful products have fueled organic growth. We also believe in supporting small business owners who play a vital role in our communities. Despite operating in only 12 states, we are ranked as #6 SBA Lender in the country, the 15th consecutive year M&T is ranked in the nation's top 10 SBA Lenders. And for the first time, we have finished as the top SBA Lender in Connecticut, an important milestone following our acquisitions of People's United.Our commitment to supporting the communities we serve extends to affordable housing projects with almost $2.3 billion in financing and over 2,600 home loans for low- and moderate-income residence. Additionally, M&T Bank and our Charitable Foundation granted over $47 million in support of our communities in 2022 and approximately $30 million so far in 2023.Please turn to Slide 6. Here, we highlight our ongoing commitment to the environment. Last year, we invested over $230 million in renewable energy sector, and have significantly reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2019. Our ESG report was published in July, but I encourage you to review this slide for some of the highlights. M&T's ESG ratings have improved at Moody's, MSCI and Sustainalytics. Turning to Slide 8. There are several successes to highlight this quarter. We continue to see growth in auto dealerships as well as specialty businesses. We continue to grow customer deposits despite increasing competition and building on the strong liquidity position and comparative strength of our financial position in the industry allows us to continue lending in support of communities and local businesses. We remain focused on diligently managing expenses. Our third quarter results continue to reflect the strength of our core earnings power.Third quarter revenues have grown 4% compared to last year's third quarter. Pre-provision net revenues have increased 4% to $1.1 billion. Credit remained stable. Net charge-offs decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date, we still remain below the historical long-term average. GAAP net income for the quarter was $690 million, up 7% versus like quarter in 2022. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $3.98 for the third quarter, up 13% from last year's similar quarter.Now let's review our net operating results for the quarter on Slide 9. M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $702 million and diluted net operating earnings per share was $4.05. Net operating return on tangible common equity was 17.41% and tangible book value per share increased 3% compared to the end of June.On Slide 10, you will see that diluted GAAP earnings per share was down 21% from linked quarter. Recall the results from the second quarter of last year indicated an after-tax -- [$157] gain from the sale of the CIT business in April. Excluding this gain, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were down 3% compared to the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an ROA and ROE of 1.33% and 10.99%, respectively.Next, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated the third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.79 billion in the third quarter, down $23 million from the linked quarter. This decline was driven largely by higher interest rates on consumer deposit funding. An unfavorable funding mix change, partially offset by higher interest rates on earning assets and one additional day. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 7 -- 3.79%, down 12 basis points from linked quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift, which reduced margin by 7 basis points.The net impact from higher interest rates on customer deposits, net benefit from higher rates on earning assets which we estimate reduced the margin by 6 basis points. The remaining 1 basis point was due to higher nonaccrual interest, net of the impact of 1 additional day. Turning to Slide 12. We -- Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion from the linked quarter, due largely to the strong deposit growth that drove the $3 billion growth at the Fed. Average loans declined $928 million and average investment securities declined $630 million. Turning to Slide 13 to talk about average loans. Total loans and leases averaged $132.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, down 1% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at loans by category, on average basis compared to the second quarter, C&I loans increased slightly to $44.6 billion. We continue to see growth in dealer and specialty businesses. During the third quarter, average CRE loans decreased by 2% to $44.2 billion. This decline was driven largely by our continued strategy to reduce on-balance sheet exposure to this asset class.We have chosen to modernize our suite of products and services to offer more alternatives to better serve customers and to do so in a more capital-efficient manner possible. Average residential real estate was $23.6 billion, down 1%, largely due to portfolio paydowns. Average customer loans were down slightly to $20.2 billion. The decline was driven by lower auto loan and HELOC balances, partially offset by the growth in recreational finance and credit card loans.Turning to Slide 14. Average investment securities decreased to $28 billion during the third quarter. The duration of the investment securities book at the end of September was 3.9 years and the unrealized pretax available-for-sale portfolio was only $447 million. At the end of the third quarter, cash held at the Fed and investment securities totaled $59.2 billion, representing 28% of total assets.Turning to Slide 15. We continue to focus on growing deposits with our customers, and we're pleased with the growth in both average and end-of-period customer deposits. Average total deposits grew $3.3 billion. However, consistent with our experience in prior rising rate environments, increased competition for deposits and customer behavior continues the mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits. Average customer deposits increased $1 billion. The customer deposit mix to migrate to average demand deposits declined $2.3 billion in favor of commercial sweeps and customer money market savings and time deposits.Average brokered deposits increased $3.2 billion (sic) [$2.3 billion], while a federal home loan bank advances decreased $2.2 billion. On average, brokered money market and NOW increased $800 million, brokered time increased $1.5 billion. Brokered deposits represent just one of the several funding vehicles that we can employ in our management of the balance sheet. At September 30 of this year, brokered deposits represented 8% of our outstanding deposits and short-term borrowings.The pace and reduction in demand deposits seem to have decreased during the quarter. Our determined focus on retaining and growing customer deposits yielded positive results during the quarter.Next, let's discuss noninterest income. Please turn to Slide 16. Noninterest income totaled $560 million in the third quarter compared to $803 million in the linked quarter. As noted earlier, the second quarter included $225 million from the sale of the CIT business. Excluding this gain, third quarter noninterest income decreased $18 million compared to the second quarter driven predominantly by $15 million related to one month of the CIT trust revenues included in the previous quarter. Other revenues categories were largely unchanged from the linked quarter.Turning to Slide 17 for expenses. Noninterest expenses were $1.28 billion in the third quarter of this year, down $15 million from the linked quarter. That decrease in expense was due to $11 million in lower compensation and benefit costs, reflecting lower average headcount, lower expenses for contracted resources and overtime. $6 million lower in other cost of operations, largely reflecting lower sub-advisory fees as a result of the sale of the CIT business, lower legal-related expenses, partially offset by losses associated with certain retail banking activities. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and security gains or losses from a denominator was 53.7% in the recent quarter compared to 53.4% in the linked quarter after excluding the gain from the sale of the CIT business.Next, let's turn to Slide 18 for credit. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $54 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the third quarter, we recorded a $150 million provision in credit losses which was equal to the second quarter. Net charge-offs were $96 million in the third quarter compared to $127 million in the linked quarter. The reserve build was primarily reflective of softening CRE values and the variability in the timing and the amount of CRE charge-offs. At the end of the third quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.3 billion, a decrease of $94 million compared to the prior quarter and represent 1.77% of loans, down 6 basis points sequentially.As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $96 million, significant charge-offs were tied in 4 large credits, 3 large office buildings in Washington, D.C., Boston and Connecticut, and one large health care provider operating in multiple properties in Western New York and Pennsylvania. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 29 basis points for the third quarter compared to 38 basis points in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date net charge-off rate to 30 basis points, which is below our long-term average of 33 basis points.We continue to assess the impact on future maturities and our investor real estate portfolio due to the level of interest rates, the impact of value declines and emerging tenancy issues. Continued targeted deep portfolio [dies] in office, health care and multifamily portfolios are being done to identify any new emerging issues. When we file our upcoming Form 10-Q in the few weeks, we will estimate the level of criticized loans will be up to mid- to high single-digit percent as compared to the end of June, largely due to increases in investor real estate.Reflective of the financial strength and portfolio diversification of the CRE borrowers, almost 90% of the criticized loans are paying as agreed. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, were $354 million at the end of this quarter compared to $308 million -- $380 million sequentially and total 76% of these 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.Turning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CIT (sic) [CET1] ratio at the end of September was an estimated 10.94% compared to 10.59% at the end of the second quarter. The increase was due in part to the continuation of the pause of repurchasing shares. At the end of September, based upon the proposed capital rules, the negative AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from variable for sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 36 basis points.Now turning to Slide 20 for outlook. With 3 quarters in the books, we will focus on the outlook for the fourth quarter. First, let's talk about the economic outlook. The economic environment was supportive in the third quarter, and we were cautiously optimistic heading into the last quarter of this year. In the third quarter, the overall economy continued to expand, thanks to the strong consumer spending and steady capital expenditures by businesses, though the housing market continues to struggle in the high-rate environment.Encouragingly, inflation continued to slow in label markets, while still tight improved substantially with steady hiring while age pressures dissipated. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the economy will continue to grow, but at a slower rate. We expect that, that slower growth will continue reducing inflation pressures. The Federal Reserve has probably reached the end of its hike cycle, given slower inflation and recent run-up in long-term rates.With that economic backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income to be in the $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion range. As we noted on the previous calls, a key driver to net interest income continues to be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth. We expect the continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. We remain focused on growing customer deposits. For the fourth quarter, we expect average deposits to be about the same level with growth of interest-bearing customer deposits but continue to decline in demand deposit balances. This is expected to translate into a through-the-cycle interest-bearing customer deposit beta through the fourth quarter this year to be in the mid-40% range. This deposit beta excludes brokered deposits, including brokered deposits, would add 6% to the beta. While the percent of the cumulative beta is slowing, we anticipate it will continue rising into the first half of next year.Next, let's discuss the outlook for the average loan growth, which should be the main driver of earning asset growth. We expect average loans and lease balances to be slightly higher than the third quarter of $1.33 billion level. We expect the growth in C&I, but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages for our consumer loan balances should be relatively flat.Turning to fees. We expect noninterest income to be essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding intangible amortization and the FDIC special assessment to be in the $1.245 billion to the $1.265 billion range in the fourth quarter. Intangible amortization is expected to be in the $15 million range and the FDIC special assessment is anticipated to be $183 million. Given the prospects of slowing revenue growth we remain focused on diligently managing expenses. Turning to credit. We continue to expect loan losses for the full year to be near M&T's long-term average of 33 basis points. which implies fourth quarter charge-offs could be higher than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect tax flow equipment tax rate to be in the 25% range.Finally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security marks have been a clear differentiator for M&T. M&T has proven to be a safe haven for clients and communities. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders' capital very seriously and return capital loan it is appropriate to do that. Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day. We are still evaluating the proposed capital rules so that we believe that now is not the time to be purchasing shares. That said, we are positioned to use our capital for organic growth. Buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us from our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies.To conclude on Slide 21, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. While economic uncertainty remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed its peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles with growth about 2x that of peers. Our strong shareholder returns include 15% to 20% return on tangible common equity and robust dividend growth.Finally, our disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of capital -- shareholder capital and our integrated -- our integration of People's merger is completed. We are confident in our ability to realize our potential first merger. Now with that, I'll turn it back to our caller who'll briefly review the instructions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""You spoke about a mid- to high single-digit increase in criticized loans this quarter. I was wondering how is the mix changing between hotel, health care and office. And it also looks like nonaccrual loans take lower this quarter. So, can you talk about what the drivers are there? Whether there's loan sales or any other underlying drivers? And if that had any benefit to net interest income this quarter?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes, happy to do that. So on the criticized increase, it's really just more of the same that we're seeing. It's more increases just in our IRE portfolio, primarily on the office side for the most part. So, nothing really different from trends that we're seeing as far as nonaccruals, there was one large property that was sold in New York that was a primary driver for the nonaccruals. We actually had a gain in that that helped margin probably by about $5 million in the quarter."", 'Manan Gosalia', 'Got it. And then maybe just on the buybacks. What is the criteria to resume the buybacks from here? Because it seems like we have more clarity on regulation at this point. Is it a function of M&T issuing more in the debt markets and then starting buybacks? Is it to do with the credit rating agencies? Any color you can throw there would be helpful. especially given how much excess capital M&T has at this point?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So, I definitely agree with you, Manan, in that we do have excess capital. But right now, the economy is still kind of unpredictable, rates higher for long, we'll probably continue to have stress on clients over the next couple of quarters if that actually comes to fruition. They were just trying to be conservative and cautious at the same time. And it's also for us to actually have an opportunity to continue to grow organic growth in our commercial and consumer books and our trust folks as well. So, I think we're just trying to be cautious and we know when the economy gets a little bit more comfortable, we'll consider repurchases there. It is true to our long corn strategy, the capital distribution back to the shareholders. It's not going anywhere, but we just want to continue to make sure that we're strong and can grow and serve our customers right now."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', 'Good morning. I guess just want to follow up, in terms of -- so, your NII guidance for fourth quarter is fairly clear, but we are hearing from some of your peers around potential for the margin NII bottoming in the fourth quarter especially if the Fed is done, give us your thought process around -- is there something about your balance sheet, why that might get pushed out because of just deposits have been related to the price or the dynamics on your balance sheet or your markets? Any color there would be appreciated.', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. Manan, it's really the biggest driver for the net interest margin for us right now is really what happens to our noninterest-bearing deposits. We were down $2.3 billion that was better than what we thought it would be. And we think that it's slowing down. We'll see how that plays out in the fourth quarter. But that is probably the biggest determining factor. When you look at our balance sheet, though, I'm actually pretty pleased with how the assets are repricing. If you look at the reactivity rate of some of our fixed portfolios, if you look at this quarter, like our consumer loan portfolio was up 22 basis points.We have home equity in there that is prime related, but that's a smaller percentage. We have really good repricing and other consumer portfolios like auto was up approximately 300 basis points in what was rolling off versus what was rolling on. If you look at our RV and loan portfolio, that was up a practically 250 basis points of what was rolling off from on, so, I think once we get more stability in the disintermediation of deposits, I'm more favorable and the margins stabilizing. I think the asset side is actually performing pretty well."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""Noted. And I guess just moving maybe give us a mark-to-market in terms of commercial real estate, what you're seeing around there's some concern whether if we go into next year, given what the yield cost done, we might see some more pressure flow beyond CRE office into multifamily. So, one, give us a sense of like on CRE office has the visibility improved around the level of marks that you might have to take as some of this work through this system and whether or not you're seeing more pain beyond the office complex."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So, on the office side, I would tell you, our credit team, we feel really on top of what's going on there. I think we are actively looking at any credit that could be and have any issues whatsoever. We're looking at it. I'm trying to put the right valuation in there. We traditionally run with a higher level of criticized assets because we have a lot of long-term clients that have been with M&T for a long time period. They have other sources of cash flow to help carry the loans and are willing to put in equity to help support the loans. When we do find loans that there is not support around, we'll probably move to exit those.As far as the valuations go, there's still not a whole lot of specifics out there. We did have that one sale for us that actually was a little bit better than what we had at mark there, but that was one -- one big loan. So, I wouldn't say that's a trend by any stretch right now. But I think we feel pretty good on where we are. As far as the other asset classes, I think we -- just with rates higher for longer, just puts more -- just tougher for some of our -- the customers.And multifamily is an area that we are looking at as well. Nothing really is popping out of anything very superior there yet. But we're just trying to stay ahead of what potentially could happen and kind of be preemptive if we see anything. So, we're just preparing. Our credit team is very experienced. We've been very good with commercial real estate for a long time, and we are on top of where we are."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS..', 'Erika Najarian', ""I just wanted to clarify sort of the responses to Ebrahim's question, Daryl. I'm just wondering as you think about the forward curve as we see it, at what point do you expect net interest income to trough based on what we know about the curve and what we know about the various puts and takes for growth and deposit actions."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. From a framework perspective, it's really when the intermediation slows down. And when this intermediation slows down, I think on the asset side, is performing well and will continue to reprice higher because I think we're going to have a steeper curve for a longer period of time. And hopefully, that will happen in the next couple of quarters, but it's really hard to know right now we think it's slowing but I think we'll just see how that plays out. I'll give you guidance next earnings call on the fourth quarter on that. But conditions could be slowing down with what we're seeing right now, but 1 quarter is not a trend. I just want to get a couple of quarters under our belt before we really say net interest margin is going to stabilize."", 'Erika Najarian', ""Got it. And as a follow-up to that, your period-end cash balance rose to $30 billion, Daryl, which is awesome dry powder. And as we think about the quarters ahead on one hand, it potentially -- the Fed is peaking, right? And you seem to be rather asset sensitive. On the other, you have all these new rules on liquidity that we don't have yet as well as treatment of AFS for regional banks. So, how should we think about an absence of stronger net loan growth. The puts and takes of what you're -- are you just going to continue to build cash and be a little bit more asset sensitive even though we're peaking in rates as we figure out what the final rules look like on both capital and liquidity."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I think we have the strong position at the Fed that's intentional for us right now. We want to be really conservative with our cash and liquidity position. Like I said earlier, the economy is doing okay, but slowing down and maybe hopefully not get into a recession, but we just want to be really careful and cautious from that perspective. So, I think it's an intentional where we're staying there. Will we invest some of that obviously into loans, we would love to do that to support our customers, but we are not widening our credit box whatsoever. We're going to grow what the market will give us.But we do think there's opportunities to grow relationships and to potentially grow balances in some of our loan categories. So, we'll see how that plays out. As far as deploying some of it -- the cash into the securities portfolio, I would just say that over the next year, you might see us move a little bit to the investment portfolio, but it will be on a gradual basis."", 'Operator', ""The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", 'First, sorry if I missed it, but did you comment on what your reserves are against your office book?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""We haven't made that probably, Matt, but it continues to increase where we are right now. So, we had an increase in our allowance, we had a little over $50 million. I'd say about half of it went to the CRE portfolio, and half of it went to the C&I portfolio. So, I think we were adding it where we think it's appropriate based upon our models and performance."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""Okay. Yes, that would be helpful again over time. I know everybody's book is a little bit different, but many of your peers are disclosing so that would be helpful as you think my disclosure is obviously an area of focus. Maybe switching gears, like, as you think about all the capital that you have and liquidity and the balance sheet flexibility, what areas of lending are you leaning into, not just kind of looking at 1 quarter but the next few quarters. And is it kind of doing more business with existing customers or also trying to grow the customer footprint?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I mean, this past quarter, we had growth in our dealership businesses. As the strike was starting to happen, I think a lot of dealers actually stocked up on used cars, and that actually drove an increase in utilization in that one sector are a little bit earlier than normal there. That will probably continue to play out, I think, into the fourth quarter while would be one. Our large corporate banking, I think, has some growth opportunities where we're positioned there.Specifically on fund banking, I think we're growing there nicely. It's a very conservative portfolio, very short-term oriented, lower risk areas. So, I would say most of the growth that we're seeing is in the C&I space. Those are the highlights right now. It is very competitive in middle market C&I. We are trying to be competitive there. But right now, the higher interest rates are just putting a lot of our commercial clients to be a little bit more cautious. But when they're willing to borrow, we're trying to help them when that's -- when we're able to do that. So."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.', 'Bill Carcache', ""I wanted to follow up on your comments around a higher for longer rate environment being tougher for your customers. As you look across your portfolio, do you have a good handle on the degree to which some of your customers had put on swaps maybe when we were still under [0], 2 to 3 years ago. So, they haven't yet felt the pressure of higher rates. Curious about whether the rolling off of those swaps is something you worry about, not really not just in CRE, but really across all loan categories."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. I think, obviously, Bill, I mean, people that did swaps 3 years ago are really fortunate that they did, but it depends on the maturities when they roll off. And when they do roll off, it does put pressure on some clients that basically just have higher interest payments there. So, that is impacting much broader than just office, broader than just CRE. It's impacting, I think, all of the America right now, to be honest with you. I mean just higher rates for longer. I think the Fed wants to slow the economy down and we're definitely having that impact to do that, and they're accomplishing what they're achieving there.But we -- like I said earlier, we are on top of the portfolios where we see maturities coming up. We're looking at what we have to do, if anything, do they have other support on it. So, we're trying to stay ahead of what's coming down the pipe. Most of the maturities and swap are lined together so that they're pretty much in balance. So, when things come close to mature on loans is when we see if there's anything that needs to happen from a lending perspective. But I think the Fed is accomplishing what they're trying to do is slow the economy down, bring inflation down, and it's definitely having that impact."", 'Bill Carcache', ""That's really helpful, Daryl. If I could follow up, as you continue to take actions to shift more of your focus to fee income as you reduce the credit risk associated with on-balance sheet CRE. How are you thinking about your sort of longer-term CET1 target before I guess, all of the developments of the last several quarters, we're sort of thinking of M&T being able to get to sort of that 9% CET1 target. But I guess, the inclusion of OCI volatility and regulatory capital has led to some debate over whether category for banks will now have to run with a little bit larger buffer versus history? Would appreciate any thoughts there."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. I think as the new rules play out and as we get comfortable working within the rules, we obviously start with a higher cushion at first. And then as you get used to managing the book and everything, I think we will tighten it up over time. But my guess is that we probably have a higher buffer coming out of the blocks. You have to really adjust your investment portfolio since the AFS is going to now go through the regulatory capital ratios to probably run with shorter durations either outright or invest longer with hedges that bring in the durations one way or the other, just so you have less volatility there. So, it's really just getting used to how we manage all that process. But our teams are working on that now and we will start operating that way probably well before we get the roles actually implemented from that perspective."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brent Erensel with Portales Partners.', 'Brent Erensel', ""I was going to follow up on that stock buyback question. If you were to like incrementally invest the capital that you're generating at 7% you would generate half the returns that you could by buying back stock. So, you need double-digit returns to equate that, if that question makes sense. So, the question, I guess, is when -- at what point will the corporate finance maths drive you to resume buybacks?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""So, the Corporate Finance math is screaming that it's a 5% right now. It's really more of our cautious position, conservative nature that we have to make sure that we have really strong capital, strong liquidity to really weather what comes our way. I mean if the Fed stays higher rates, let's say, for 3 years or whatever, that could really have a big impact on the economy. We just want to be really cautious and all that. So, I think we're just trying to be prudent with it. Like I said earlier, the capital has not gone anywhere. We won't -- I promise you we would deploy it in a really shareholder-friendly manner from that. But right now, we have strong capital, strong liquidity, which has been really helpful for us since the March, April time frame, and we will continue to operate and be a strong supporter of our customers and communities that we serve."", 'Brent Erensel', ""Just is there a bell that's going to go off when you guys are going to change your mind? Or how should we -- do we just wait and see?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', 'I will tell you, once we make that decision to go, my guess is you will find out very quickly when that decision is made.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Daryl, over the years, M&T has been very effective in making acquisitions. Obviously, the People's -- that deal is the more recent acquisition that is now completely integrated. And we understand in talking to your peers and others that the interest rate marks make it very difficult for M&A today. So, I got a 2-part question for you.First, just what is your view on M&A for M&T over the next 12 to 24 months of traditional depositories. And then second, some of the P&C, in particular, was recently bought some assets from the FDA, I see some loans. Are you guys looking at any assets that might be for sale from the FDIC from the failed banks that we had earlier in this year?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So, we didn't do a press release on it, but we did buy 2 loans from that same purchase P&C did. I think it was a total of about $300 million in commitments, it was at fund banking. So, we did participate in there, and we're able to get a couple of those loans as well. But we are constantly looking at where we can grow our customer base that are good, long-term customers that fit. We just don't want to do asset purchases, we want relationships is really what we're looking for to drive our organic growth from that.As it relates to acquisitions, it's just -- you and I have been doing this for a long time. When I started, we had 18,000 banks in the early '80s. Now we're up to about 4,000 banks and it's going to continue to shrink. I think M&T has a great track record of acquiring bank over time. And that strategy hasn't changed. Our strategy is really to control and have lots of density in the markets that we serve. So, I think if and when we do purchase acquisitions, it probably won't be a surprise in where we're going and what we're trying to do from that perspective.So, the strategy is there, and it will happen at some point down the road. The interest rates definitely make it a little bit more challenging now just because of the impact on capital. But like anything, things change over time, and we will be there when we need to and do what we've been really good at before, and we'll continue to do that."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Very good. And then the second part, a different question as a follow-up. When M&T, of course, has developed a reputation as being a very strong underwriter, you got the numbers to prove it. And so, we're not necessarily concerned about what you guys are doing specifically but we always worry about the competitors doing foolish and stupid things that then end up having a second derivative effect on your sound underwriting decisions.Can you frame out for us -- granted, I know it's not in 2005 and 2006 craziness out there. But -- are there any concerns that you see nonbank lenders or other bank lenders doing or have done things in the last 18 to 24 months on the lending side that make you a little nervous? Or are we just in a new playing field, everybody is very rational, and we're not going to see anything really implode because of what some foolish lenders are doing?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. We have a long history of working with our clients. Client selection is really huge for us and how we look and underwrite. So, like in the CRE portfolio, we deal with people that have been in the business for a very long time that aren't just looking at that real estate investment that they have as an investment for more as a long-term strategy to their company and their family from that perspective.So, we really don't look at trying to get out of the criticized loans. If somebody is not going to support it, we will probably exit over time. But I don't really view how we are approaching it. I think it's a great way to develop and keep relationships over the long term. It's the right way and a fair way to do it. As long as they're willing to support their properties and loans with us from that perspective.I think overall, though, I think the industry is quite safer than what it has been over the last couple of decades. I think everybody is trying to do the right thing. We have the benefit that we have some really long-term customers that have been with M&T for a long period of time, and we try to bank the people that are really top in market in all the markets that we serve."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', ""Just a follow-up around the loan loss reserve. I know you had talked about the -- that the reserve addition was 50% for CRE and half going to C&I. And I'm just trying to frame out like what about the developments in the quarter drove the need for additional reserve additions beyond what would have already been baked into there under CECL? And then separately, can you maybe talk about the likelihood of further reserve build here just as you continue to dig through the CRE portfolio, I know you said a couple of times that there's ongoing efforts to sift through the exposures in that book."", 'Daryl N. Bible', 'Yes. So, if you look at the macro factors, our macro factors when we run our allowance models, basically were pretty steady. Actually, that CREPI index actually improved a little bit. But the other economic statistics are pretty stable versus the prior period. And really what drove the increase was really softness in some of the asset values in the CRE portfolio is what we were seeing and thought it made sense to add some more reserves in those. As we get more examples of what valuations are that could help drive more or may actually -- I think we feel really reserved where we are today, but we just want to continue to have a really robust allowance for the needs of our borrowers and make sure we comply with all the rules that we have there. But it was really just a little bit of softness in some valuations.', 'John G. Pancari', ""And is that softness surprising you negatively? And is that why it's not already in the CECL reserve?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""There's just not a lot of activity going on in some of these markets right now. So, you're basically -- there's a big market dislocation. A lot of the marks we're doing is conservative as they are with a net present value cash flow perspective. And we -- I think I went through it last time, but if some is not leased today, we assume it's not least for 3 years. If something is coming off lease within the next year, we assume that there's a 1-year gap period before it gets re-leased. Those type of cash flow adjustments are kind of what we're marking to, but we don't have anything to look at. But when you get a certain example, I would say then we can make an adjustment.Our best though right now is that there's a lot of money waiting on the sidelines potentially that when the Fed does decide to keep rates more stable and maybe signal rates going down at some point, I think there will be a lot of money that will jump back into the system. Right now, there's just not a lot of going on, and there's a very wide bid-ask spread."", 'John G. Pancari', ""Okay. That's helpful. One last follow-up, if I could, also on credit. Your -- I know your charge-off guidance for the fourth quarter, you expect it to be a low -- above the 29 basis point level for the third quarter and then full year '23 near the long-term 33 bps. Can you maybe help us think about what that would imply in terms of as you look into 2024. Maybe help us -- I know you're not giving formal guidance yet on '24, but how should we think about where the loss trajectory could be versus that longer-term 33? How much above that could it be?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes, that's a good question. For the fourth quarter, it's just our gut feel that it might be higher. It could actually be the same or lower, to be honest with you right now, but just knowing what's going on right there. It might be higher, but we really aren't sure about that yet. Next year, we aren't really giving guidance, but from a framework perspective, our allowance will build when either market economic conditions allow for it or you see some deterioration in customer behavior. From that perspective. But right now, I think we're really on top of what it is, any areas that we potentially could have risk in our credit teams are all over it, looking at the reviews and the analysis that we have. And right now, what we feel that our reserve is adequate, and then we're in good touch with where the risks are."", 'Operator', 'It appears we have no further questions at this time.

""I think we\'re just trying to be cautious,"" Bible said. ""When the economy gets a little bit more comfortable, we will consider repurchases there.""', ""Bible's comments come as the financial services industry gears up to fight proposed regulations linked to the Basel III regulatory framework that bankers fear could result in increased capital requirements on banks with at least $100 billion in assets."", 'When Bible discussed the buyback pause in July, following completion of its Federal Reserve stress test, M&T was reporting a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.59%. At Sept. 30, the same ratio had crept up to 10.94%.', '""The capital isn\'t going anywhere,"" Bible said. ""We just want to continue to make sure that we\'re strong and can grow and serve our customers right now.""', 'Fitch Ratings reaffirmed its ""A"" rating on M&T\'s debt securities last week, due in large part to expectations that the company would continue to hold capital at similar levels. The buyback pause ""increases capital resiliency under a severely adverse economic scenario and is a key support of today\'s rating affirmation,"" Fitch stated in an Oct. 12 press release.', 'The strategy is not without critics. Brent Erensel, an analyst who covers M&T for Portales Partners in New York, said on the conference call that the bank would need to generate double-digit returns on new loans to equal the impact of buybacks. ""So, the question I guess is at what point will the corporate-finance math drive you to resume buybacks,"" Erensel said. M&T reported third-quarter earnings totaling $690 million Wednesday, up 6.6% year over year. Average deposits increased 2% on a linked-quarter basis to $162.7 billion, though heightened competition drove funding costs higher, leading to a 12-basis-point contraction in the net interest margin from the prior-quarter result. M&T\'s net interest margin stood at 3.79% on Sept. 30.', 'Growing deposits remains a top priority, but making additional headway will likely prove challenging, as Bible predicted ""continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows.""', 'Third-quarter credit quality numbers were solid for M&T. Net charge-offs of $96 million amounted to an annualized 29 basis points of average total loans, down sharply from the 38 basis points the company reported in its second-quarter results. M&T reported a third-quarter provision for credit losses of $150 million. That was in line with the June 30 level despite improved credit-quality metrics — nonaccrual loans declined along with net charge-offs. Bible cited ""softness"" in commercial real estate valuations, as well as a ""gut feeling"" that charge-offs would jump in the fourth quarter, for the decision to continue stockpiling reserves. Taking a provision well in excess of net charge-offs boosted M&T\'s allowance for credit losses to $2.1 billion, or 1.55% of total loans, an amount Bible termed adequate.', '""We feel really on top of"" what\'s going on, Bible said. ""I think we are actively looking at any credit that could have any issues whatsoever."" M&T, however, is likely to disclose that criticized assets reached the mid-to-high-single digits in the third quarter 10-Q report it expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ""in the next few weeks,"" Bible said.', 'That finding ""takes some of the shine off the better than expected charge-off and non-accrual"" numbers M&T reported, Autonomous Research Analyst Brian Foran wrote Wednesday in a research note.', ""Amid growing worries industry-wide about charge-offs, M&T recently moved to expand its risk management and commercial underwriting toolbox, agreeing to begin using OakNorth's credit intelligence technology. M&T joins a growing list of U.S. banks that have turned to the London-based fintech. OakNorth's client list includes the $557 billion-asset PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, the $207.3 billion-asset Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati and the $48 billion-asset Old National Bancorp in Evansville, Indiana.

(""H&P"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: HP) today announced its planned capital expenditures and supplemental shareholder return plan for fiscal year 2024. The Company also announced the timing of the upcoming conference call and webcast for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.', 'President and CEO John Lindsay commented, ""I am pleased with the execution of our 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan, utilizing it to not only maintain a competitive dividend yield, but also to take advantage of what we viewed as dislocations in stock prices to opportunistically repurchase shares. A key element in the plan’s design was flexibility, which we believe is necessary to return capital more efficiently to shareholders in a cyclical business such as ours. Our 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan will retain many of these characteristics, including the flexibility to further invest in the business, supplement additional dividend returns, and/or repurchase shares if and when those opportunities arise.', '""The Company’s annual supplemental shareholder return plans serve to augment our long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2024, our current base dividend of $1.00/share per annum will continue to serve as a foundation of that cash return commitment. The supplemental dividend for fiscal 2024, which we anticipate will be approximately $68 million in the aggregate, is intended to further enhance shareholder returns. The Company’s annual supplemental shareholder return plan is a fundamental component of our overall capital allocation strategy. Accordingly, the planned supplemental dividend for fiscal 2024 is lower than fiscal 2023 as we balance, among other things, the outlook for this fiscal year’s activity levels, which are more subdued than last year’s at this time, and our continued efforts to expand internationally, including the related capital required to do so. We continue to recognize that our international strategy is a long-term diversification and growth commitment, and capital devoted to its expansion will take multiple years to fully develop and generate returns for the Company.""', '2024 Supplemental Shareholder Return Plan:', 'The Company has established its 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan, which is currently projected to provide approximately $68 million in additional cash returns to shareholders in the form of additional dividends. These supplemental dividends are expected to be paid in four, approximately equal, installments during fiscal 2024. These additional cash returns represent approximately 50% of the Company’s projected cash flow generation in fiscal 2024 after planned capital expenditures and after the Company’s already established ""base"" annual dividend of $1.00/share, which is roughly $100 million on an annualized basis. All such established base and supplemental dividends are subject to the determination and approval of the Company’s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.', 'Under the plan, the Company may utilize remaining cash flow projected to be generated in fiscal year 2024, after planned capital expenditures, established base and supplemental dividends, as well as cash on hand, to fund additional supplemental dividends or to opportunistically repurchase shares of its common stock under its evergreen four million shares per calendar year annual repurchase authorization. The Company currently has approximately 1.3 million shares remaining under its calendar 2023 authorizations. Such repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including market and industry conditions and other investment opportunities available to the Company.', 'The 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan is specific to fiscal year 2024 and is derived from current forecasts and projections for fiscal year 2024, which are subject to change based on industry factors and market conditions. Our intention is to refresh the plan in subsequent fiscal years with adjustments made based on relevant factors and market conditions at that time, including the Company’s projected cash flow generation, and accretive investment opportunities.', 'On October 17, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash supplemental dividend of $0.17 per share, payable on December 4, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 20, 2023. The payable date and record date of this supplemental dividend coincide with the dates applicable to the Company’s base dividend of $0.25 per share, which was declared on September 6, 2023.', 'Planned Capital Expenditures for Fiscal Year 2024:', 'Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 are expected to range between $450 and $500 million, reflecting our commitment to investments to support international expansion, walking rig conversions and to complete capital spending deferments that were made during the years impacted by the pandemic. H&P’s North America Solutions segment accounts for approximately 60% of the expected spend as the Company plans to convert some additional rigs to walking configurations and as maintenance capex per rig pushes slightly above the previous $1.1 to $1.3 million per active rig range. The Company’s International Solutions and Offshore Gulf of Mexico segments account for roughly 33% of the planned expenditures in fiscal 2024 as the Company continues to fund its international growth. Specifically, plans include converting additional super-spec rigs domiciled in the U.S. to walking configurations, as well as making other modifications to them, in preparation for international export and upgrading 3 rigs in Argentina to super-spec. Included in the anticipated spend for the North American Solutions and International Solutions segments are amounts allocated to convert up to 14 super-spec rigs located in the U.S. to walking configurations. Furthermore, a portion of those rigs are slated for further modifications and international export. The remainder of the planned spend for fiscal 2024 is slated for corporate and information technology purposes as the Company continues to invest in and modernize its own operational and business-driven technologies.', 'Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, ""We believe our 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan was a success. During fiscal 2023 we returned approximately $450 million of capital to shareholders, which represents over 10% of our current market cap. These returns were in the form of approximately $104 million in base dividends, roughly $98 million in supplemental dividends, and approximately $249 million in share repurchases, which represented roughly 6% of the shares outstanding.', '""The Company’s annual supplemental shareholder return plan is an integral part of our overall capital allocation strategy serving as a complement to our annual capital expenditure program. The 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan retains the flexibility that we believe is required to appropriately allocate capital to on-going operations, take advantage of growth opportunities and provide shareholder returns. To that end, during fiscal 2024 the Company expects to deploy approximately $640 million in capital - $450 million to $500 million in capex plus approximately $168 million of expected cash returns to shareholders. Another $68 million of expected fiscal 2024 cash flow generation, which is currently unallocated, coupled with our cash on hand at September 30, 2023 of approximately $350 million, provides the Company further opportunistic flexibility. This flexibility can be used for variety of other investments and/or capital allocations, including allocation of approximately an additional $50 million towards purchase orders for long-lead items for rig-related capex expected to be incurred in fiscal 2025.', '""In our North America Solutions segment, we anticipate fiscal 2024 maintenance capex per rig will be slightly above the fiscal 2023 range as lower levels of planned tubular purchases are offset by plans to complete capital spending deferments from prior years. Capital expenditures for our International Solutions segment are expected to remain a meaningful part of overall capex. The projected spend here again coincides with international markets increasing focus on unconventional drilling, which has even accelerated since our last earnings call in late July, leading us to allocate more capital here to take advantage of the developing opportunities. Additionally, as part of our overall capital expenditure program in fiscal 2024, we expect to complete up to 14 walking rig conversions in the U.S. Approximately half of these conversions will be utilized domestically as long as customer demand for our walking rig configuration persists at reasonable rates of return. The remainder of these conversions are intended to receive further modifications and are earmarked for potential international export.', '""Despite market volatility in fiscal 2023, we were able to execute on the 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan as originally anticipated. That said, each new year comes with new expectations and the 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan represents our current intention of returning capital to shareholders during fiscal 2024 based upon our outlook of market and industry conditions at present, including our current expectations surrounding rig pricing, activity levels, margins, cash generation, capital expenditures and other investment opportunities. In determining whether to proceed with the 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan as originally intended and any future supplemental shareholder return plans in later fiscal years, management and our board of directors will continue to review the Company’s financial position and performance together with relative market conditions at that time.""', 'Investor slides for October 2023 are available for download on the Company’s website, within Investors, under Presentations.', 'Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call and Webcast:', 'The Company’s financial guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 and full fiscal year 2023 are consistent, except as noted, with those provided in the Company’s press release dated July 26, 2023.

Before I begin, I would like to offer brief comments on the situation in the Middle East. We were horrified by the acts of terrorist violence that occurred in Israel last week, and we were deeply saddened by the subsequent loss of innocent lives at Israel, Gaza and the lighter region. Our focus has been on supporting our people and our clients with connections in the region. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay engaged with them throughout this emerging crisis. Turning now to my remarks about the quarter. I will start by covering Nasdaq's performance and how our strategy is unfolding in the context of the current operating environment as well as provide key business highlights. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a detailed review of our financial results. I'm pleased to share that Nasdaq continues to make solid progress on our strategic objectives to capitalize on the key megatrends shaping the financial system. Nasdaq continues to execute against its strategic vision, become the trusted fabric of the global financial system, delivering broad-based growth across our businesses including 6% overall net revenue growth and 8% year-over-year organic revenue growth in our Solutions businesses. I'm proud of the team's efforts to continue to serve our clients, and I'm pleased to see our revenue growth improving in the third quarter, aided by strong performance in our Capital Access Platforms division particularly in our Index business. In addition, our Anti-Financial Crime division continued to deliver strong results with solid growth in our Surveillance business and Verafin continuing to demonstrate strong new customer growth as well as an expansion contract with the Tier 2 client. With respect to the market backdrop, during the quarter, we saw a variety of cross currents including increasing market volatility, fluctuating equity markets and rising long-term interest rates. Nevertheless, we experienced modestly improving momentum in our Listings business amid a gradual reemergence of U.S. IPO activity, with 35 operating companies choosing to list at Nasdaq during the quarter. Based on our client conversations and our growing IPO pipeline, we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the upcoming year. Across the company, as we've discussed before, Nasdaq is well positioned to thrive by capitalizing on 3 key megatrends that are shaping the financial system: the modernization of markets; the development of the corporate and investor ecosystem for environmental sustainability; and the increasing need for integrity solutions across the financial system, including risk management, surveillance, regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime technology. By aligning our business with these key megatrends, we're unlocking attractive opportunities for sustainable growth, and we're building a diversified business that's well positioned to succeed through economic cycles. In this regard, I'd like to provide a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate the progress we're making to capitalize on these growth opportunities. First, our focus on market modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. A major driver of that innovation has been our ability to adopt and leverage technologies, including cloud and artificial intelligence across our markets and in our products. In the third quarter, we are pleased to announce the approval by the SEC of the first exchange AI-powered order type, which we call Dynamic Midpoint Extended Life Order, or Dynamic M-ELO. For the last several years, we've offered an order type called the Midpoint Extended Life Order for clients seeking larger trade sizes at the midpoint. The order introduces a fixed holding period to gather order interest before execution. Through extensive testing and consultation, we determined that our clients' trade execution could be improved under certain market conditions by applying adaptable holding periods. This led to the creation of Dynamic M-ELO, which leverages AI to adjust the length of holding periods throughout the trading day on a stock-by-stock basis to improve fill rates and reduce market friction. We're very excited to roll out this enhanced order type to our clients in the coming months, and we see significant opportunity ahead to drive the application of AI and other emerging technologies across our markets. Next, regarding the development of the environmental sustainable ecosystem. During the quarter, we were proud to launch 2 new offerings designed to help corporates and investors streamline their sustainability journeys. Following the acquisition of Metrio last year, we have integrated Nasdaq's OneReport and Metrio's sustainability reporting and workflow offerings into a single solution called Nasdaq Metrio, which was officially launched during the quarter. Nasdaq Metrio is a SaaS-based end-to-end solution that helps corporates better collect, measure and report sustainability data on a single platform. In addition, in our Investment Intelligence business, we announced the launch of Nasdaq eVestment ESG Analytics, which is designed to help asset managers better quantify and showcase the environmental, social and/or governance impact of our portfolio's position in the market. It enables asset managers to demonstrate their portfolio sustainability strategies to asset owners, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments. These 2 solutions underscore our role as a bridge between corporates and investors by creating market-based, demand-driven solutions that help bring clarity to a rapidly evolving environment for sustainability reporting. Lastly, looking at the increasing need for integrity solutions, including risk management and anti-financial crime technology. We're developing innovations that make our clients' anti-money laundering, or AML, programs more efficient. Specifically in October, we have launched the beta version of an AML workflow co-pilot tool that will leverage generative AI to automate portions of our clients' AML processes. We look forward to updating you on our progress of these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to leverage technology to advance our clients' evolving needs. Turning next to our results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. We achieved $940 million in net revenues, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year period and an increase of 5% on an organic basis. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $694 million, up 9% from the prior year period and 8% on an organic basis. Our total ARR increased 6% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million in the third quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 37% of total company ARR. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $456 million in total revenue in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 15% from the prior year period. The performance in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance; $24 billion in net inflows over the past 12 months, including $5 million in the third quarter; and strong futures capture, partially offset by lower derivative volumes. Our Workflow and Insights revenues grew 5% over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for project work in our ESG solutions and steady Analytics solutions sales to asset managers. While we continue to see elongated sales cycles for certain products in this business, we've not seen a material improvement or worsening of sales cycles from the second quarter of 2023. Our Data and Listing Services revenues grew 5%. Our Listings revenues was largely unchanged due to continued muted IPO activity and heightened delistings, while our data business delivered continued strong revenue growth, driven by demand from international data clients. We maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings, ending the quarter with strong momentum from some of the year's biggest IPOs by proceeds raised. Year-to-date, Nasdaq welcomed 83 new operating company IPOs for an 84% win rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we have welcomed 4 of the 5 top IPOs by capital raised. And in the third quarter, we achieved an overall win rate of 95% and welcomed several marquee IPOs, including Arm Holdings and Instacart. This momentum was also bolstered by several notable listing switches to Nasdaq in the quarter, including DoorDash and Roper Technologies. Overall, 11 companies have transferred to Nasdaq year-to-date, representing a total market value of $184 billion. The September listing success coincides with the launch of our new IPO and Broadcast Center at the Nasdaq market site in Times Square, further establishing Nasdaq as the world's premier venue for listings. The reimagined space reflects our commitment to showcasing our clients and elevating their IPO experience, and enables us to create more visibility for first trade celebrations through increased access to global media outlets. Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to capture new listings activity. We have a strong pipeline of companies that have committed to NASDAQ and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO time lines. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $381 million in total revenues during the third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. In our Trading business, revenues declined 1% compared to the prior year with lower European revenue, partially offset by modest growth in U.S. equities revenue, due to higher revenue capture and a small FX benefit. In our market technology business -- our Marketplace Technology business, revenue grew 4% with growth in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology Solutions. During the period, we completed delivery of a major CSD project for our Latin American central securities depository and signed a contract extension, including an upgrade to our next-gen trading system, with one of the largest stock exchanges in Southeast Asia. Turning next to a brief update on Adenza. We're progressing well towards the closing of the Adenza transaction. We've completed the antitrust review, and Thoma Bravo is on track to obtain the remaining approvals from the Nordic and Baltic financial regulators to become a major shareholder in Nasdaq. Therefore, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. As previously disclosed, this business will be reported as part of the newly created Financial Technology division, alongside our Marketplace Technology and Anti-Financial Crime businesses. In the third quarter, Adenza continued its strong performance, delivering constant currency ARR growth in the high teens. Year-to-date through the third quarter, they added 17 new clients and 3 total cross-sells, which compares to 7 new clients and 3 cross-sells over the same period last year. Additionally, Adenza maintained solid growth in net revenue retention at 97.4% and 113%, respectively. We're also pleased with the momentum of Adenza's journey towards a cloud-based delivery of solutions across both existing and new clients. Through the first 3 quarters of 2023, 55% of bookings have been for cloud delivery solutions versus 27% over the same period last year. Since the transaction was announced in June, we have held extensive integration and planning discussions with the leadership team at Adenza, and we're very excited about the opportunities ahead. As a result of our early interactions together, we have developed a very clear path and process for integration that we intend to execute successfully starting on day 1 post close. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $93 million in total revenue during the third quarter, a 21% increase in the prior year period. Nasdaq Verafin grew 29%, primarily driven by growth in the adoption of our fraud and anti-money laundering, or FRAML, solutions by small- and medium-sized banks as well as an expansion of wallet share among existing clients. We continue to expand client relationships with 47 new small, medium-sized financial institutions adopting our FRAML solutions. Additionally, we continue to have momentum in our move-up market. This quarter, we signed an expansion agreement with an existing Tier 2 bank client. Specifically, this is a bank client that signed on to our fraud detection and workflow solution in the first quarter of 2023 and has now expanded their relationship with us to include our complex investigation solution. We view this expansion as a strong proof point in our ability to land and expand our relationships with large bank clients. We continue to be actively engaged in contract negotiations and proof of concepts with several Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, and remain on track with our plans to sign additional large banks in the coming quarters. Our Surveillance business delivered 9% organic revenue growth with continued new customer growth, including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers, as we expanded our leadership position with large customers. And lastly, I'm pleased to announce that we've officially named Brendan Brothers as Executive Vice President of our Anti-Financial Crime division. As you may recall, Brendan was named to the role on an interim basis earlier this year, and we're thrilled to welcome him formally as a member of our leadership team, continuing to report directly to me. To wrap up. Our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified business and reflect our strong position going into year-end, with the closing of the Adenza transaction view. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details."", 'Ann M. Dennison', ""Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. Turning to this quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter 2023 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $940 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including an 8% organic increase in the Solutions businesses, and slightly lower Trading Services revenue, and $3 million in net positive impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 4%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 90 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $349 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $335 million or $0.68 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year period while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million, an increase of 11%. ARR and SaaS revenue growth in the quarter reflects broad-based growth led by continued booking strength in our Anti-Financial Crime division. We are delivering solid performance despite ongoing elongated sales cycles in certain areas of our Workflow and Insights business, similar to recent quarters. We are working closely with our customers in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and are executing well on our strategic pillars of bringing liquidity, transparency and integrity to financial markets. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15 starting with the Market Platforms division. Revenues increased $2 million or 1%, driven by positive impact from changes in FX rates. Trading Services' organic revenue was down 2% driven by lower European trading revenues due to lower volumes, despite better cash equity revenue capture that offset largely flat U.S. revenues. While we have seen an increase in off-exchange trading, which is common in a lower volatility environment, Nasdaq's share of available volume has remained steady. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, reflecting solid revenue growth in our Market Technology business. As a reminder, Marketplace Technology revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery that we don't expect to recur in the second half of the year. We continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium-term outlook. ARR totaled $511 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period. This growth rate is lower compared to prior periods due to slower trade management services growth, resulting from near-term market conditions. Market Platforms' operating margin was 52% in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 370 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue resulting from lower European trading activity as well as higher compensation costs, ongoing investments related to migrating U.S. markets to the cloud and investment in new growth opportunities in Marketplace Technology. Turning to Capital Access Platforms. Revenues increased $34 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $32 million and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. We delivered broad-based organic growth in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in Index. Index revenue increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 22% increase in average AUM over the prior year quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased 14%, reflecting higher pricing per contract, partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $24 billion, including $5 billion in the quarter. While AUM has benefited from a strong year-to-date market performance, we saw AUM impacted by overall markets trending lower in the last 2 months of the quarter. Moving to Data and Listing Services. Our revenue grew 5%. Excluding the positive impact from changes in FX rates, organic growth was 4%. Revenue growth reflects continued strength in our data business and the combined impact of delistings, and a more muted IPO environment on listings revenue growth. However, as Adena mentioned, we have seen several high-profile initial listings and 11 switches year-to-date. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the third quarter of '22, reflecting growth across our ESG and Analytics businesses despite ongoing elongated sales cycles with corporates, particularly for our IR tools and for our asset owner portfolio management solutions, affecting revenue growth in the third quarter. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period. While ARR growth related to our data products remain solid, the Capital Access Platforms' ARR growth rate has been impacted by slower listings growth and the impact of continuing elongated sales cycles on parts of our Corporate Solutions and Analytics businesses. The division operating margin was 56% in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of roughly 50 basis points from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $16 million or 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Growth reflects robust demand for Fraud Detection and Anti-Money Laundering solutions as well as our staff-based Surveillance solutions. Our fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 29% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Surveillance revenues grew 9% compared to the third quarter of '22 with continued customer growth, including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers. These new customer wins reflect our ability to drive growth beyond our leadership position with large banks and expand into new customer segments. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $348 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $381 million, an increase of 19% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 33% in the third quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period, with approximately 1/2 of the margin growth resulting from the timing of recognition of incentive compensation. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $32 million to $449 million. The increase primarily reflects a $32 million organic increase or 8%. The organic year-over-year increase reflects increased compensation and benefits expense, due primarily to increased headcount and the impact of merit increases, higher technology spend attributable to continued investment in our business and higher G&A expense. We are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.785 billion to $1.805 billion, which is a $10 million reduction to the top end of the guidance range. As a result, the midpoint of the updated expense guidance range is $5 million lower than our prior guidance, which reflects an annual expense increase of approximately 4.5% for 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range. Additionally, we narrowed our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance range from 24% to 26% to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. We expect to come in at or around the midpoint of this updated range for the full year. Turning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza-related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.4x, down from 2.6x at the end of the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $108 million. And in September, our Board approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to a total of $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains solid,and our cash flow generation is strong, including $1.6 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We remain well positioned to support organic growth, execute on the deleveraging plan we announced with the Adenza acquisition, increase our dividend payout ratio over time and repurchase shares to minimize dilution. In closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to perform consistently well across the wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to Adena."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Thank you, Ann. And before we turn to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Ann Dennison. After 8 years at Nasdaq, Ann will be stepping down from her role as CFO at the end of this year. Ann has been a guiding voice to the market on our financial performance, a leader in enhancing our Investor Relations and ESG reporting efforts and a steward to our company's transformation, most recently through our announced acquisition of Adenza. In conjunction with Ann's upcoming departure from Nasdaq, we're pleased to welcome Sarah Youngwood as our next EVP and CFO. Sarah will join us from UBS Group where she served as CFO and a Group Executive Board member. Sarah will officially join us on December 1, and we'll work closely with Ann and the team to ensure a seamless transition. I want to thank Ann personally for her many contributions to Nasdaq. She's been a phenomenal partner to me and the company, and we wish her the very best. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And I show our first question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan.', 'Michael Cho', 'I just wanted to touch on Adenza for my first question. I think, Adena, you talked through the update and I think you mentioned the ARR. But can you also just -- hoping you can talk about for both Axiom and Calypso, the year-to-date revenue growth trends for both of the segments. And then related to that, I was hoping you can touch on kind of the revenue opportunity or revenue growth opportunity as you think about clients going from on-prem to the cloud solution for Adenza.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, we don't provide or break out the financial, the revenue differences between Axiom and Calypso. But we do provide -- I can give you some color in that -- when we're looking at new bookings for the year, we had -- as I mentioned, we had 17 new clients so far in 2020 -- or I should say they have 17 new clients so far in 2023 and 3 cross-sells. And when we break that up between Calypso and Axiom, Calypso had 9 new client sign up and 1 cross-sell; and Axiom 8 new client sign up and 2 cross-sells. And then in terms of the upsells, 95 total. And it's really a good even split, 55 upsells in Calypso and 40 in Axiom. So it's really a nice split of revenue growth and opportunity across both of these solutions. When we think about why that is the case, I think that there are a range of reasons, just trends out in the marketplace that are driving demand for both risk management solutions, more advanced risk management solutions for -- across all asset classes as well as better regulatory reporting solutions. And obviously, those are the 2 great things that Calypso and Axiom do. And when we think about that acceleration of new sales because they had 7 new sales -- new clients sign up last year versus 17 this year. We're definitely seeing a momentum in terms of the regulatory obligations that are coming into the United States as well as the Basel III end game that's really coming across both the U.S. and Europe driving certain demand, but then also moving down market. I mean I think Axiom did a really nice job of bringing in even more banks and brokers into their solutions. So generally, it's just -- we're very pleased with the continued momentum in the business. When it comes to cloud, it's really interesting to see. As I mentioned, the 55% of total bookings were for cloud -- I'm sorry, new bookings were for cloud delivery solutions versus 27%, I think it was last year. And that's really, I think, a combination of 2 things. One is the fact that banks are more ready to accept cloud delivery solutions. And so that's been a real -- we've seen that across all of our solutions across Nasdaq. They're just more ready to have cloud be a big part of their infrastructure. And they're trying to -- some banks are purposely trying to move out their data centers. I think that the second is that the cloud-based delivery solutions are modern. They're modular, they're more flexible. And I think that the team has done a really nice job of selling the benefits of that. And you're right in terms of the revenue opportunity. There is a revenue uplift when we are able to sell a cloud module because we become a managed service provider and that takes away costs from on their side for managing an on-prem solution. So we are able to upcharge from that. We haven't discussed what that means in terms of revenue uplift. But -- so one thing just to recognize also is that from a GAAP perspective, cloud revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Whereas on the on-prem revenue, there's more revenue recognized upfront. So this will create more stability in revenue going forward as well."", 'Michael Cho', ""Okay. Great. If I could just switch gears a little bit for my second question. I just want to touch on Verafin. I mean, it seems like revenue growth is accelerating there. I'm just curious, the types of conversations that Nasdaq's had been with clients there. I mean, do you get the sense that the SMB clients are tightening budgets or expanding budgets for these types of solutions in Verafin?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""I would say that every bank is facing more and more challenges of fraud and AML. So the fraud side is just a pure -- it's a very easy return on investment calculus because they are losing money to fraud and they have to -- and when they make their clients good on something that's happened in their accounts. So it's a really nice, clear return on invested capital when they come in and leverage our solutions. Additionally, it is a cloud-based solution. So they're having to make less of an upfront investment from an infrastructure perspective. And so it's a cleaner kind of, frankly, commitment to us. And then lastly is we do a really good job of onboarding clients. And so particularly small to medium banks, we have an amazing machine to onboard those clients and bring them up into the system very quickly. For the large-scale banks, we're working really well with them to integrate or implement and integrate these solutions. And as you can see, we did have that one expansion contract with the client that just signed [OFS] in the beginning of the year. So the they took our solution. We've been able to implement it and immediately sort of realizing that they wanted more capabilities from us with the complex investigations. So we see really good opportunity to expand. In the AML side, it's a matter of just a lot of regulatory pressure and frankly, the banks really having a true interest in just making sure they do not have that type of money laundering going through their systems. And so again, it's an increasing threat. It's become more complex. Our systems are more advanced than many others. We use a lot of AI in the algorithms to root out criminals. We're able to show much -- many fewer false positives and more activity found than our competitors, and it's just driving a lot of good conversations and demand. So we're -- I really do think -- also the last thing I would say is -- really interesting is when I go to these conferences and I have gone to meetings with small banks, and I have had banks come up to me and say Verafin is by far their favorite partner. They just -- they find that we're a really good partner, and they use that word as opposed to vendor. And I think that that's really a testament to the great service that the Verafin team provides to the clients."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW.', 'Kyle Kenneth Voigt', 'So now that you have line of sight to deal closure and you have a bit more clarity on the interest rate environment and where your stock is trading, just wanted to revisit the topic of capital allocation after the deal closure. How should we think about capital priorities, specifically on deleveraging versus buyback, post deal closure? And is there any framework you could provide for maybe level of buybacks anticipated for a specific period, post deal closure, that could kind of help frame the mix there?', 'Adena T. Friedman', 'Ann?', 'Ann M. Dennison', ""Sure. Kyle, Absolutely. So as we think about post deal closure, obviously, we will evaluate the market conditions from a share repurchase perspective. But in terms of our capital priorities, first and foremost, we are going to continue to invest to drive the business organically. But after that, our priority is to deleverage and to meet the deleveraging targets that we set out when we announced the Adenza acquisition. And then beyond that, we -- our next priority will be to increase our dividends to get our payout ratio up to the 35% to 38% ratio over the next 3 to 5 years. And then beyond that, what's [up October], we're going to use to offset the dilution, both from our employee share issuances and then also from the issuance related to the Adenza deal. And our cash flows remain very strong. I mentioned we had $1.6 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. So we feel really well positioned to do all of those things in the priority order that I listed."", 'Kyle Kenneth Voigt', ""Okay. Understood. And Adena, I mean, you mentioned some of the drivers for the strong kind of high-teens growth for Adenza ARR. Just given the nature of the Adenza business, kind of the length of the sales cycle there and the progress that you've seen since the deal announcement in June, just wondering if you could provide any updates on -- do you feel more or less confident in kind of that medium term -- low to mid-teens medium-term revenue growth target for Adenza as we look out and for 2024, specifically?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes. So we don't, as you know, provide anything specific to a year. But our medium-term outlook of low to mid-teens revenue growth across the Adenza business, and that would be ARR plus the customer delivery revenue, we continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve that once Adenza becomes part of Nasdaq. I think as I mentioned, there continues to be a really nice strong demand generally for the solutions. And then also, I think that they've really been able to show the ability to upsell the clients. So the fact they're signing more new clients this year than last year just gives us more [accessibility] over time. And the environment is -- these are kind of need-to-have solutions from banks. I think that, particularly as we're managing through an increasingly complex regulatory environment., ,there's more risk in the system than there has been in the past, pretty risk and other things that -- and also across currents across asset classes. They really are driving demand for the solution. So over the medium-term outlook, our medium-term outlook remains the same at that low to mid-teens overall revenue growth."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.', 'Michael J. Cyprys', ""I wanted to ask about Verafin. I was hoping you could speak to the competitive environment today for Verafin, how you see that evolving. Understand there's big tech companies, such as Google, that have introduced some AML solutions. So maybe you could speak to how your solution differs. Talk about some of the steps you're taking to stay ahead of the big tech competitors that have deep pockets in AI expertise."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure. Yes, so I think that there is a difference between what Google is doing and what we're doing. So Google is partnering with a specific bank and providing AI algorithms to support that internal bank's -- essentially think of it as like an internal build but leveraging Google's infrastructure. So the bank is bringing to that relationship very specific algorithms and patterns of that they're looking for, what we call agents. And so that really is kind of what I would say, more of a facilitated on -- a facilitated bespoke build but with the Google -- underpinning the Google infrastructure, and you're right, in the benefit of their AI capabilities. What we do is a purpose-built complete software solution that is purpose-built for the needs of fraud and AML detection, investigation and reporting. And so we provide an end-to-end solution. The fact that we have transaction data across 2,500 banks, and we also -- we are a cloud-based solutions. So we're able to bring all of that transaction data together. And we leverage AWS. So AWS is our cloud provider. We're leveraging their AI capabilities and their AI engines, including the bedrock solution that we're using for the gen AI capabilities that we're adding. I think that it allows us to benefit from another great large technology company. But we have built a purpose-built solution that is scaled across 2,500 banks. And so it makes it to the bank doesn't have to do their own bespoke build. We are benefiting from the knowledge across all of these banks and the experience in what they're seeing to continue to tune our engines and to build out the solutions. And the last thing I would say is we do weekly releases. And so we're always staying on touch with the banks as to what they're seeing and bringing those agents into the system that then benefits all of our clients, not just 1 client. So we're really -- we do think it's a different -- it's a totally a different sale than it would be to look at -- as compared to what Google is doing with that one bank. The last thing I would say is we are winning share, and we're winning in terms of taking out internal builds because of the benefit of the consortium data that we have and the really nice workflow solution. And we're also taking out competitors so we're really pleased with the momentum."", 'Michael J. Cyprys', ""Great. And just a follow-up question, if I could, just on Verafin. FedNow just launched in July a new real-time payments rail. But there's some concerns around fraud that might limit the uptake by institutions. So can you just speak to Verafin's real-time payment solution? How you see the opportunity set evolving there? And any sort of lessons learned from the clearing houses real-time payment service that's been in place for some time? And I believe you have a solution there as well."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes, yes. Actually, we do. We connect with FedNow. We connect with the clearing house. So we are rolling out a real-time payment solution. And we've been in contact with the Fed in the context of their rollout. We've been working with the big bank -- the core banking system providers because they also -- they provide core infrastructure to the banks to be able to integrate FedNow and other real-time payment solution. So we've been working with them to make sure we're integrated into their solutions and make it easy for the banks to onboard us for fraud detection. So it's definitely -- that is actually a specific growth area that we're engaged with our SMB banks, our small to medium banks as we speak."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.', 'Craig William Siegenthaler', ""I wanted to first touch on the pickup in IPO activity. So it was really nice to see a high win way at Nasdaq this quarter, including several big IPOs. But since then, we've seen the markets pull back, rates rise. Now I know you mentioned you have a robust pipeline, but how has the recent macro, including the conflict in Israel impacted the near-term pipeline?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes, it's a great question, Craig. It has impacted it. So I think I would say what -- how would you characterize '22 and '23? It's been -- we're coming off of a very significant environment and what I would call a free money environment; coming into an environment that with rising interest rates, which creates unpredictability of the future; an economy that seems to have a lot of resilience but is still slowing down and a lot of unpredictability that investors are struggling with. Because at the end of the day, they have to underwrite the future earnings of a company, and if they can't understand the overall economic environment, it's hard to underwrite that risk.So I would say '23 started with a pretty deep [frost]. We started to see some light green shoots, as (inaudible) likes to say, as we went through the spring, as the interest rate environment became a little bit more known. But the fact is that it kind of fits and starts. So we'll have a window open and we, obviously, had some really interesting companies come out in September. And then you're starting to see the macro environment change again, the geopolitical environment become much more unstable. And that, of course, is making investors pause again on understanding how to take that risk. So we do actually have a really good pipeline of companies. We're really, really proud of the team. I mean, our team is just awesome. And so they're really working hard to work with clients. But the majority of the conversations we're having with clients, not all of them, but the majority are about the first half of next year, much more so than the second -- than the fourth quarter of this year."", 'Craig William Siegenthaler', ""Adena, and just for my follow-up and also on a similar topic. Can you remind us what percentage of your data and listings revenue is coming from initial listings? And can you quantify the headwinds from roll-offs from accrued revenue from that strong 2021 and '20 IPO period?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes. I know -- again, a good question to understand kind of the dynamics in the listings business. So I don't know the exact percentage of revenue that's coming from new listings. Because just to remind everyone, we have our annual listing fees and then we have our initial listing fees. Our initial listing fees are amortized over a 2- to 4-year period -- 2 to 6-year period, I think, depending on the type of listing it is and how big it is. So you're right that there is some initial listing revenue that's rolling off in -- from the 2021 listings, not all, but some as that amortization flows through, and that will come off in '24. The answer is around 10% of our overall listing revenues, so -- which is and the listing revenue is somewhere in the range of..."", 'Ann M. Dennison', 'Year-to-date, $300 million.', 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes, $300 million. So it's -- that revenue will have some fluctuation as you go into 2024. And so you've got to look at the combination of the new listings and as well as from an annual listing fee revenue perspective, the delistings that we're experiencing. We do provide you that data every quarter, as we think about what the billing cycle is going to look like in January for the annual fees. So those are the big factors to consider in '24."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.', 'Owen Lau', ""So your organic growth of the Solutions business has accelerated and come back to your medium- to long-term outlook. You talked about the strength in Index and anti-fin crime business. I'm just wondering if the equity market, Verafin and other business remain stable in the near term and IPO market remain like muted, how should investors think about your organic growth over the next few quarters, excluding Adenza?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Sure, Owen. Well, I mean, we don't give specific guidance or specific outlook quarter by quarter or year-over-year. But I think that you're right that we're really pleased to see the Solutions businesses revenue growth really returning into the medium-term outlook that we're -- we have been communicating to you all for a while now. And I think, Owen, if we have a healthy IPO environment, and that really starts to -- that engine starts to turn on again in '24, I think that you'll see the primary benefit of that will actually start to happen in '25, just because it then flows into our annual listing fees. But beyond that, if we have a stable and healthy trading environment, listing environment that then, obviously, drives really good index flows, it drives data demand. And it also probably loosens up and makes it so that corporates and investors are more ready to invest in their new solutions that help automate a lot of the manual processes they have. So it could -- that could continue to unlock more interest and, frankly, easier sales decisions in that space. When it comes to market tech and anti-fin crime though. Those are really good solid demand businesses where exchanges are very, very focused on bringing their technology into the future, and we now have -- I think we've done a nice job of really getting to a state of maturity across our CSD solution, our next-gen clearing solution, our next-gen trading solution so -- and our risk management solutions there. So we feel like that demand driver is more stable generally. And then anti-fin crime is just -- as you know, it's a need-to-have technology, and we do think we have the best technology available. So that demand, we just feel like is much -- is very structural. So I can't say, Owen, exactly what that means for Solutions business growth. But having a healthy -- general healthy market environment certainly helps create even more opportunity for us."", 'Owen Lau', ""Got it. That's helpful. And a quick one on the sales cycle on Adenza. I mean, we have been talking about the elongated sales cycle. I'm just wondering, is there any like sales cycle impact on Adenza? I mean you talked about high teens growth, I think, for Adenza in the third quarter. I'm just wondering if there's no -- Adenza sales cycle, the budget -- is in release or things like that. How high it could have gone?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Yes. I actually do think that there are more gates that are -- all of the larger institutions have a lot of gates to walk through. And I think that our anti-fin crime business, we're marching through these gates. But the gates -- there are many gates. And we have great experience in the past, especially with our Surveillance business, to kind of understand that. But with the (inaudible), there are more gates that they're walking through to get to a sale, particularly with the larger institutions, except when there's a regulatory demand. And that's what we're -- really interesting. I mean, we've had some really interesting super regionals sign up for Axiom like within 3 months or 4 months. That's been some really shorter -- yes, some really short sales cycles when there's a regulatory demand. But if there isn't really a near-term or immediate regulatory demand, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. I think they actually experienced longer sales cycles in '22 than they're experiencing in '23. But generally speaking, they -- I think that if we had a really healthy macro environment around us and more predictability of the macro environment, it would certainly be advantageous to end over time."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""Maybe just back on Verafin. Just in terms of the normal seasonality we have seen in the last couple of years in that business, or I should say Anti-Financial Crime broadly. Do you expect that also to represent the past pattern over the last 2 years in the fourth quarter? And then just sort of confidence around that 20%-plus type of growth rate that you've been able to achieve in that going into 2024?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Great. Well, generally, we do see the -- I think it's somewhere in the range like 40% of bookings occurs in the fourth quarter for our Anti-Financial Crime business. And we would say that, that's generally what we're seeing. So we -- now the difference, though, is that if we -- when we do upsell to the largest banks, there's a little bit of that's not necessarily seasonal, and we don't have as much experience there. So we're not seeing -- that's not something that every single fourth quarter, we're going to see something different. But certainly with the small and medium banks, which is the core business of the anti-fin crime business so far, the fourth quarter is a big sales quarter. And that's actually the case for Adenza as well, kind of 40% to 45% of bookings tend to come in the fourth quarter. In terms of just the general growth characteristics of the anti-fin crime business, we're very pleased with the progress. We continue to see good opportunity to continue to grow in that 18% to 23% growth rate that we've been experiencing."", 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""Of note, it's good to see the progress there. And then, Adena, maybe if you could just update us on the status of the SEC market structure proposals. I know it's a big debate in the industry and there's a lot of back and forth on that. But do you see anything being potentially implemented in 2024? Or do you think it's -- the debate will sort of linger on, at least, into '25?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""I think that on the 4 proposals that the SEC has proposed, I would expect that we'll see something come out to be -- to start to get implemented as we go through 2024. We don't know what that's going to look like yet. I think they've had a lot of comments on the proposals. And I think that in general, the 2 that seem very -- that feel a little bit more certain are the tick sizes and the 605s. Those 2 proposals feel quite certain. I think that on the best DECKS and the Order Competition Rule, those are ones that have engendered a lot more debate within the industry. So we don't know exactly how that's going to turn out."", 'Operator', 'And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic.', 'Simon Alistair Vaughan Clinch', ""I was wondering if we jump back to Adenza again and just your comments about your preparation toward integration. Obviously, this is a large transaction, and it's one that you're actually going to be fully integrating to the business. I was wondering if you could give us an update on, I guess, what the puts and takes are to this plan. And ultimately, how to think about the technology stack and what that -- what the integration of that, of Adenza in to your existing cloud infrastructure really means for the expense base and margins of that business going forward."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Great. Thanks. Well, I can say that Tal and the entire team has been extremely focused on building out a very robust integration plan. We've been engaged with the Adenza team now for several months, and we're having regular engagement with them to develop those plans and make sure that we feel really good about how we're going to kick off the integration on day 1. And we built a lot more granularity to the plan. We still, obviously, don't own them. So once we own them, and we're able to meet more people and really understand the operations, we'll be able to flesh that out into a great amount of detail. But we're extremely committed to achieving the integration expectations that we delivered to you all at the announcement. We also definitely see benefit in the cloud infrastructure that we have. That's actually part of our integration. We have not done a lot of detailed work yet on that because we don't own them. We have a lot of, in my opinion, proprietary IP when it comes to our cloud capabilities and our cloud team. So we want to make sure that we own them before we go into really, really deep dives on the technical infrastructure. But our relationship with AWS, we think, will be a benefit. I think the expertise that we have in creating very efficient cloud infrastructure, particularly from a data ingress/egress perspective, I think it's going to be very helpful. And so we look forward to really working with them to continue to develop this cloud capabilities. I have a great view of -- in 5 years, like how do we want these services to be delivered? How much do we want to have a single-tenant, multi-tenant capabilities? What kind of overall -- overarching environment do we want to create for our clients so they see us as a strategic partner across risk management, regtech, anti-fin crime, capital markets? It's -- there's a lot that we can do there, but we have to get in there, we have to own them. We have to kind of get really engage with them so that we can give you a better answer to that in the coming months and quarters."", 'Simon Alistair Vaughan Clinch', ""That's great. I guess just a second question here, and just changing tack a little bit. Just on the cash equities business, I've noticed that the revenue capture has been rising quite substantially while the sort of market volumes have stagnated or fallen. And I know some of this has to do with mix, but I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on sort of what the dynamics are there. And is this a deliberate sort of management on your part to, I guess, smooth out revenue by taking a bit more pricing when times slow down? Or how should we think about that strategy going forward?"", 'Adena T. Friedman', 'Well, I think one of the things we\'ve always said is that we like to make sure that we have a good balance between share and capture. And one of the things we\'ve been focused on is what is our share of available liquidity? And Ann mentioned before, we\'ve been able to manage to a pretty stable share of available liquidity. And what do we mean by that? In times when volatility goes down, there tends to be more trading that occurs off exchange. So the off-exchange trading percentage tends to go up. So then we look at it and say, ""Well, what can we actually achieve and bring into the exchange and how are we competing with other exchanges?"" And there, we look at what we call available liquidity. And I think we\'ve maintained a pretty stable share of about 30%. And then within that, we then say, ""Hey, what kind of volumes are we trying to attract into our solution?"" We want to attract volumes that are additive to overall-wise in the platform. So one, certain orders that come into the market feed other orders, and we\'re going to work hard to get those orders in. The other thing is we provide a lot of really interesting, as we mentioned, specialized order types that also allow us to charge different rates for their services because they\'re specialized execution capabilities, and that allows us to have a higher capture. But the one thing we don\'t do is just chase share that just is fleeting, that if you chase that share, you can really have a significant negative impact on capture, and frankly, not get share that\'s additive to the NBBO, not get share that brings other volume in. So we\'re very, very intentional about that, and that\'s why you\'re seeing some capture go up because more of the volumes moving towards our specialized capabilities, and we\'re not doing what others of our competitors are doing in terms of chasing fleeting share.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO, for closing remarks."", 'Adena T. Friedman', ""Great. Thank you. Well, we are excited to continue to update all of you in the coming quarters as we approach the closing of the Adenza transaction, and we continue to advance along our journey to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system.

Two key basins have been the focus of much of this activity. I refer to the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford, each of which has attributes that draw the interested eyes of companies with strong balance sheets and cash to spend.', 'This article continues a series I started back in August, with this\xa0OilPrice article\xa0where the recent activity by Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) in the Eagle Ford snapping up Validus Energy was discussed, among others. The theme of that article was “Big fish, eating little fish.” What we didn’t get into then in any detail, and will do in this article, is look at one of the primary metrics now driving this merger mania in the shale patch.', 'Reserve replacement', 'It shouldn’t come as any surprise to anyone that oil and gas companies need to make new discoveries at a rate greater than they are producing reserves as daily production. We call this Reserve Replacement-RR, and it is one of the primary drivers causing big operators to use some of their cash hoard in M&A activity. The challenge before these companies is it is becoming more difficult to replace production-which has been increasing monthly, as the most recent\xa0EIA-Drilling Productivity report\xa0notes, through new drilling alone.', 'One of the key problems inherent in this effort has been the shift producers have made in reallocating cash flow from new drilling to shareholder returns. These returns have been very popular with investors but have come at a price for reserves replacement even as Finding and Development-F&D costs for a broad cohort of shale E&Ps, have declined as the blue bars in the\xa0RBN Energy\xa0graph reveal. The sharp bump higher in RR from 2020-2021 came in part from companies reappraising reserves that had been previously written down in the oil price collapse. Once this was complete, we see the line flattening into 2022 as new drilling shoulders the burden for many operators.', 'One of the things that comes into focus is how some companies have done a better job than others at RR. We can start with Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), a company soon to be merged into ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). There are many reasons why XOM was determined to pay up for PXD, and we discussed some of them in an\xa0OilPrice article\xa0last April. There are other reasons, and we plan to detail them in a future article. That said, PXD’s success in replacing its reserves can’t have escaped XOM’s careful eye, at better than 300% over the three-year period, as this\xa0RBN Energy\xa0graphic notes.', 'For reference, XOM hasn’t been doing nearly as well on this metric, as this graphic from\xa0Energy Intelligence\xa0reveals. To be fair we must acknowledge the Law of Large numbers hobbles XOM in this regard. Even with the massive discoveries the last few years in Guyana XOM’s reserves are falling year over year. The purchase of PXD will buy XOM some time with its 2.2 bn barrels of P-2 reserves, and we should see a bump higher over the next couple of years.', 'It is worth noting that Pioneer is in the position it is precisely from this sort of M&A activity over several years. The company was one of the first movers in the shale M&A space with its purchase of Parsley Energy in early 2021 for $7 bn. That was followed a few months later with the acquisition of privately held Double Point Energy for $6.4 bn. Pioneer management is to be congratulated for having the vision to spend the money they did, at a time when the oilfield’s recovery from Covid lows was still nascent. It set the stage for them to become the leading Permian producer they became and ultimately draw ExxonMobil’s buyout offer at a 20% premium to recent share prices.', 'What’s next?', 'Pioneer wasn’t alone in building a shale empire to bolster reserve replacement rates on Wall Street when they couldn’t through drilling. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is another price example of a company that has transformed itself through acquisitions and divestitures over the last few years.', 'Devon made its first big splash in the M&A theatre with its $5.3 bn takeout of Ocean Energy in 2003, gaining a significant shale footprint along with deepwater blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and international interests in a number of West African countries, Indonesia and Russia. In 2015, Devon bought the Anadarko assets of Felix Energy for $1.9 bn. The next big buy was Permian-Delaware-focused WPX Energy in 2021 for $5.8 bn. WPX brought acreage that now forms the cornerstone of much of DVN’s development plans in the Delaware. It followed up WPX with Parsley Energy later that year for another $4.5 bn. Devon has continued this torrid pace with bolt-on purchases of Validus Energy in 2022 for $1.9 bn, enhancing its Eagle Ford oil-weighted acreage in the process. Then came the Williston basin assets of Rimrock Oil and Gas in the sweet spot of the Bakken play.', 'All of that M&A activity builds a company with a portfolio that is top-tier in every shale play in which it participates. Devon itself is a powerhouse with nearly 700K BOEPD output that will generate nearly $12 bn of EBITDA in the full year 2024. It trades currently at 3X EV/EBITDA and $59K per flowing barrel. For reference, ExxonMobil just paid $66 bn or $254 per share for PXD, which prior to the deal, was trading at 5-6X EV/EBITDA and $88K per flowing barrel.', 'I think it’s just a matter of time before a Super Major like Chevron (NYSE:CVX)-which has the same reserves replacement problem that XOM does, does the math and puts an offer on the table for Devon.', 'An alternative scenario might be where Devon makes a merger deal with another shale operator that would give them the critical mass to stay independent. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) has a similar acreage footprint to DVN’s and trades in the 3-4X EV/EBITDA sweet spot and at a very low-for these days, $40K per flowing barrel. Whether it’s Devon or someone else, MRO’s days as an independent operator are likely numbered.', 'Your takeaway', 'Shale drilling has been refined to a high art since the mid-teens. Longer wells and increased efficiencies in fracturing treatments have enabled operators to grow production with fewer assets. This has resulted in helping to keep costs in line and for companies to grow production year over year and pad the coffers with record cash flows.', 'Shrewd operators have used their cash flow to fund aggressive acquisition campaigns that have enhanced their reserve replacement rates. In the case of PXD, this put a target squarely on the back, and in my view, an offer like the one XOM made was inevitable.', 'As I’ve discussed, there are other companies performing at a high level in terms of reserve replacements, and I think it is very likely we will see more M&A activity in the shale patch as we head into 2024.', 'By David Messler for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', ""Energy Remains Top Priority In China's $1 Trillion Belt And Road Initiative"", 'India Looks To Green Hydrogen For Steelmaking As Coking Coal Costs Rise', 'Will Guyana Avoid The Oil Curse?', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Rentals has a superior ROE than the average (18%) in the Trade Distributors industry."", ""That is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for United Rentals by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""United Rentals does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.59. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company."", 'Of course United Rentals may not be the best stock to buy.

I’d like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.', 'Tim Arndt: Thanks Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year, namely; growing supply translating to increased market vacancy; continued moderation of demand; and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over-time. We have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing, as well as timing of new development. What’s incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it’s had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand.', 'In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter, as well as strong earnings and same-store growth. We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy, rents and values. In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of $1.33 per share. This result includes approximately $0.03 of one-time items related to interest and termination income, as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q&A.', 'Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5%, aided by retention of 77%. Net effective rent change was a record 84% at our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200%, Toronto at 187% and Southern California at 165%. Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3% and 9.5%, respectively, driven predominantly by rent change. We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62% as of September. We raised approximately $1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2%, comprised principally of $760 million within our ventures, as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability.', 'In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record $6.9 billion of liquidity. Finally, it’s noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4 times range, despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA. Turning to our markets, while rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S., driven by low absorption, as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points. At the macro level our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters.', 'A large logistic facility within the industrial real estate sector.', 'Then, over the subsequent three quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025, as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low. Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long-term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality, as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters. In coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions, it’s clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency.', 'However, what’s also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment. In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter. Rents across our Southern California sub-markets declined approximately 2% as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlook are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed. From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3% while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up.', 'The difference isn’t too surprising as the Fed’s language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call, compared to the bund [ph] at just 50 basis points. We believe that this is likely another instance, as we saw one year ago, where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least one quarter. Elsewhere, values in Mexico are up 8.5%, while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5%, a write-down that we don’t believe has fully run its course. Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately $180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of $115 million.', 'Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of $1.6 billion to approximately $700 million or roughly 2% of third-party AUMs. In terms of our own deployment, development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing $1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank. Also notable is the acquisition of $118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over $40 billion. We are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business, and their adjacencies.', 'Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity. Moving to guidance, we are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 97.25% and 97.5%. As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9% to 9.25% on a net effective basis and 9.75% to 10% on a cash basis. We are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes to a range of $520 million to $530 million and adjusting G&A guidance to range between $390 million and $395 million. Our development starts guidance is increased to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have $500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion.', 'In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance to a range of $5.58 per share to $5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes to a range between $5.08 per share and $5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5%. I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I’d like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close one year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal, even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio.', 'In closing, we are navigating the current environment, assured that whatever the economy brings in the short-term, we are positioned to outperform over the long-term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and that’s been central to our strategy and management as a company. I’d like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York, our first in four years. We are looking forward to spending the day with you, sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead.', 'Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release. And with that, I will hand it back to the Operator for your questions.', 'See also 12 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy and 11 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now.', 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.', 'Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I mean, Tim, can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks? You talked about maybe softer demand, but then there’s -- you are calling for accelerating the number of build-to-suit developments. At the same time, occupancy has been stronger than anticipated and that’s before the lower development starts hit the market. So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supply-demand dynamics as we exit 2023 and into 2024? Thanks.', 'Tim Arndt: Sure. Demand is definitely softer. It’s closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they are reluctant to pull the [Technical Difficulty]', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.', 'Craig Mailman: Hey, guys. Let me know if you are having trouble hearing me, because I am having trouble hearing you. But I just wanted to touch on the data center build-to-suits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yields on the overall development starts? And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one, the plan on whether you are going to hold this or anticipate selling it upon completion of that and just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of the data center sales?', 'Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We are just having a difficulty here. Thank you. Please remain on the line.', 'Tim Arndt: I am sorry. We are having some technical difficulties here and I can’t really explain it.', 'Craig Mailman: Hello.', 'Tim Arndt: Can you guys hear me? You can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question. To the extent I heard it, which wasn’t great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that, the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that’s why they are higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of in par and in line with our expectations. The reason occupancy is higher, it’s unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we are outperforming the market by more than we did before. I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like, and for that, I am going to turn it over to Dan here.', 'But generally, we -- the build-to-suits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best-use strategy. We own a lot of high quality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center markets. And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability. We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward, it’s going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it’s lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business, but you will hear more about that. Now, strategically, this is important to understand.', 'We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity. How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was non-strategic to us, logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositions. You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That’s where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership, it’s more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, you want to talk about the initial yields on the data center?', 'Dan Letter: Well, what I would say is, on this particular data center, we are under a strict confidentiality. So we can’t be speaking about any particular yield points by any means. But what I would say is, we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward.', 'Tim Arndt: What I would say, generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition, based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.', 'Steve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand on the fourth quarter, I think, you have got something like $1.9 billion of planned starts, given that you have done about $1.4 billion year-to-date. So just curious, does that include other data centers or is that all traditional industrial? And if so, what is the mix between spec and build-to-suit on that fourth quarter starts volume? Thanks.', 'Dan Letter: Sure, Steve. This is Dan. So the lion’s share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have one, maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But overall, it’s about 50-50 build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about four quarters now. As we talk about market development starts now at 65% -- I guess down 65% from the peak, this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume.', 'Tim Arndt: Yeah. The portion of build-to-suit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus build-to-suit.', 'Dan Letter: Correct.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.', 'Todd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Question, as you think about 2024, Tim, you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter. That’s down from 2.5% last quarter. I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead. As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you are anticipating, do you see potential for sequential or year-over-year decreases in market rents in the U.S. or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that timeframe?', 'Chris Caton: Hey, Todd. It’s Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes. We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.', 'Caitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Maybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little. I know it’s not as large of an activity as developments, but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes at an industry level are down significantly. You did the $3 billion acquisition mid-year. So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today? Could you talk a little bit about who you are buying from, maybe why they are selling and how you get comfortable on what the right price should be?', 'Hamid Moghadam: Sure. It’s a dynamic market and I think that’s the essence of your question. It’s really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here’s a model for thinking about it. First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We are not -- before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn’t want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it, but we don’t expect that to be the case going forward. So we are really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100% whole portfolios.', 'Secondly, if you really think that, look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it 4.5%, 300 basis points increased. Those kinds of properties, core properties, we are trading in the high 5%s, low 6% IRRs. Let’s stay away from cap rates because of a market-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates. But call it 6%. So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9% on leveraged IRR and that’s if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium. We get a sense that there’s going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capital-constrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those.', 'I don’t think there’s going to be distress in the terms of a post-savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns, but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that. So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9% handle on them, maybe as much as 9.5% depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next six months. Dan, do you have anything to add?', 'Dan Letter: The only thing I would add is, our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it’s value-add acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now. So it’s really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.', 'John Kim: Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, so you are expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall. And I am wondering if during that time period, are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that? And also if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023.', 'Hamid Moghadam: Yeah. On the rental forecast, I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that. And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rents. It’s hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question? Oh, occupancy trade-off.', 'Tim Arndt: Occupancy.', 'Hamid Moghadam: It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20% of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80% of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change? And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that, I mean, just look at the starts. They are down 65% and even with moderating demand, we are going to get something like 60% or 70% of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand, we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters. So there’s no sense really going cheap, it’s just. But I would say 20% of our markets, we are going to be more focused on occupancy.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.', 'Nicholas Yulico: Oh! Thanks. Just a two-porter on Southern California. So I guess, first, I wanted to see if you are seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved, the worker strikes impacting LA Basin or Inland Empire, if you are seeing any benefit there and pick up any activity. And then, secondly, just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you have cited there in rents in Southern California, what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets, meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolio?', 'Hamid Moghadam: Well, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows, 40% of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues. It’s too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything that’s going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows. About half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California.', 'I am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back, but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anything?', 'Chris Caton: Yeah. I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described. We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA, Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softer.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.', 'Camille Bonnel: Good morning. First, a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance. Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis? And then appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and there’s little that could change your core outlook from here, but want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into your end. What could change your views more positively or negatively? Thank you.', 'Tim Arndt: Hey, Camille. It’s Tim. Yeah. Just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2% decline. And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises, very moderate I would say on the occupancy side, but I actually don’t expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know. So I don’t think you will see anything take us outside of our guidance.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.', 'Ron Kamdem: Hey. Just a quick two-parter follow-up. Just one on the development starts and the data centers, which is intriguing. Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually? Is it $200 million, is it $500 million, like how big can this get is the follow-up number one. And then number two on sort of the rent growth, appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers, but as you are sort of thinking about next year, what are sort of the key markets, Southern California being one, potentially being sort of a headwind? Maybe can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year? Thanks.', 'Hamid Moghadam: Okay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that’s what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business, our data center business and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date. And by the way, even on that date, you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance, because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second part?', 'Chris Caton: Yeah. Absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon, a couple years, that’s going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth. As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think, it’s probably fair to point to Tim’s comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. and there is a range of them globally, whether it’s Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that’s what I would look to.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.', 'Anthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. I guess one more on market rent growth. I think last quarter you gave a 2023 forecast of 7% to 9%. I don’t know if you updated that today and are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forward?', 'Tim Arndt: So, hey, the view is 7% in United -- globally and in the U.S. We are about mid-6s so far this year, so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I’d like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.', 'Michael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. How does the 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next three quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023? Now, correct me if I am wrong, I believe that you highlighted that there’s going to be about 150 million square foot gap in 2023. I mean, is that still a fair assumption or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of widened that out a little bit?', 'Chris Caton: Hi. Thanks for the question. Again, it’s Chris. So, just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider. And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline’s going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really it’s really timing as it relates to that gap.', 'Hamid Moghadam: Yeah. But I would say, our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid to high 3s and not mid-4s or approaching 5. So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand out. But the thing that encourages me and we will have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs and are build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles. But they are not pulling the trigger just yet, given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.', 'Vikram Malhotra: Thanks. I just wanted to get a better sense of, you talked about deferring growth, I guess, across SoCal -- in rent growth across SoCal, Mid-Atlantic, I think, you referenced Sunbelt. Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion? And I guess, Chris, do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next, call it, six months to months?', 'Chris Caton: So the magnitude of the dispersion, so just to be clear, in terms of strengths versus weaknesses, because I want to be sure that wasn’t conflated, the strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California and really there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal, we have talked about in these market that’s been flat all year. In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of sameness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed, with some markets moderately ahead, like the strong markets I described and then just really one or two markets that are notably weaker. So I guess I suppose there’s that dispersion.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.', 'Mike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. I know you have used land in the past for higher and better uses, but do you think you would be looking at these development, the data center developments to the same degree that you would be looking at them if you weren’t seeing a normalizing of a traditional industrial demand?', 'Hamid Moghadam: Absolutely. Because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher, certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase price under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum. And by the way, let’s not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy, I mean, vacancy, sorry, that is absent 2021 and 2022 I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5 in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years. So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it’s been boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of data center opportunities and the large players and they are all big credit players into the business and they can’t get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.', 'Bill Crow: Yeah. Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all, on the economy, I am wondering if you are seeing any changes to your watch list among your tenants or any sectors in particular that are starting to show weakness. And the second question is really in order to get the kind of 9% ROE returns on acquisitions, do you have to target longer waltz or how do you get that if we don’t see distress among current holders or owners? Thanks.', 'Hamid Moghadam: So our credit issues are fairly modest and they usually involve retailers and we have a build-in 85% plus mark-to-market on those leases that we have identified as potential risks. And we have actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and releasing the space in a short period of time. So I don’t think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle.', 'Tim Arndt: And then the second question on the waltz, extended waltz being necessary for the kind of IRRs we are targeting in acquisitions.', 'Hamid Moghadam: We are using the same lease terms in acquisitions than we always have been. There is not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our waltz have been between four and a half years and six years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn’t move around that much.', 'Tim Arndt: Yeah. I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be one year to three years or four years of negative leverage as an opportunity, really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and whether we want to hold it long-term or not and then we layer that on with our potential essentials, revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it’s one consideration, so are all these other factors.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.', 'Blaine Heck: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on guidance. You touched on this a little bit, but guidance implies a decrease in FFO in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more specifically about some of the moving pieces there and one-time items that are influencing the numbers in the third or fourth quarters and whether any of that noise is going to persist into 2024?', 'Tim Arndt: Yeah. To answer the last part, no, I don’t expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the $0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income. There’s about $0.02 there I would call that, that’s permanent to the year and then the other penny in the quarter I would say is more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We will see some lower taxes in the third quarter, but higher again in the fourth quarter. So if you take that with regard to the rule, if you take that $0.03 out, you are basically rolling from, let’s call it $1.30 million to $1.28 million in the fourth quarter is what’s implied in our guidance. And basically, you would roll NOI forward.', 'We are going to add -- probably add $0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter. And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment and land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6%. Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate. We are capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That’s at 3%. So in the short-term, that’s a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long-term, the margin in value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as development’s ramp.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.', 'Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, on the utilization rate that picked down a little bit this quarter, I was wondering if you can provide any more color around that. And second, if you look at the larger development landscape and look at competitors that are developing, I would assume that the pressure for them to lease up space and maybe they have to pay back the loans to banks probably increases as we move forward. I am not sure how big these developers are or how much capital they have behind them. But is there any risk that as these developers look to secure tenants that could drive rental rates lower going forward?', 'Chris Caton: Hey, Ki Bin. I will take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page in supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it’s our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making timeframes, our sales pipeline. Specific to the utilization data, that lags. That does not lead economic and real estate cycles we have seen that over time. And so what I think this is best understood in the context of today’s retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels.', 'Hamid Moghadam: Yeah. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that are bank financed and active in the market and they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve built into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended. So actually, I think, what’s going to happen is that they can’t really be afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they are more likely to sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets and we have already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this. So don’t be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs, because -- it’s -- because of our view on demand and supply, with 65% decline in supply, we think if you get into late 2024, early 2025, we are going to be in a pretty strong market.', 'So this is where balance sheet matters. This is where quality of location and product matters, and we are going to be very selective about the projects that I described. But that’s why we have been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20% all this time. This is when we put it to work.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.', 'Vince Tibone: Hi. Good morning. I have a follow-up on an earlier comment about 20% of your markets you are managing for occupancy not pushing rent. So what are those markets where industrial landlords have less pricing power today?', 'Tim Arndt: Sure, Vince. We covered a couple of them. I talked about Southern California. I point to Houston, Indianapolis, and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland.', 'Hamid Moghadam: And China.', 'Tim Arndt: And China and I think I’d offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we are going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix.', 'Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.', 'Vikram Malhotra: I just wanted to get your thoughts to just clarify one thing more broadly. Two trends, I guess, one, just the whole reshoring team that we are hearing more and more about. And then second, just Amazon as they have put a lot of capital into the coast and across the country. I am just wondering sort of when you marry those two things together, is there sort of greater investment moving towards the Midwest or more manufacturing pockets? Is that an opportunity for PLD going forward?', 'Hamid Moghadam: So, generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there’s a lot of manufacturing still in Asia. It’s not all in China and it had been gradually declining in China in the last couple of years anyway. It was first moving to western China and then it was spreading to other places in Southeast Asia. But there are going to be strong flows still from those places. It’s just not going to be all from China. But the container doesn’t care whether it’s coming from somewhere else or China. It lands in the same ports. Secondly, demand in our product is mostly driven by consumption and not manufacturing. In manufacturing, the finished product ends up in a container and on a truck or a ship.', 'So the warehouse is a truck or a ship. So that manufacturing per se doesn’t generate a lot of demand. When those containers land in places where consumption takes place, that’s when the demand is generated for deconsolidation. Now those markets happen to be in populous parts of the country, because that’s where the consumption is and those markets tend to be high barrier to entry markets. So we don’t think the dynamic of on-shoring to the extent that it exists is going to change things around all that much. The biggest beneficiary of on-shoring has been actually near-shoring and it’s been in northern Mexico. Northern Mexico markets are 100% occupied and there’s insatiable demand for product in those markets and most of that is for distribution buildings that are used for manufacturing purposes.', 'So that’s where we have seen the material demand. If there’s more demand coming for manufacturing in the U.S., A, we haven’t really seen it and if we do see it, we will be the beneficiary of it because we are well positioned in those central markets as well.', 'Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.', 'Blaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Hamid, just a bigger picture question for you. Can you talk about how you are thinking about managing exposure to geopolitical risk and instability and maybe to what extent the latest turmoil in the Middle East could impact your operations, if at all?', 'Hamid Moghadam: Yeah. I think the effect is going to be indirect, because the Middle East is not obviously a source of product or exports or we are not active in any of those markets. So it will be a second order effect on the macro economy. And if the Fed remains very aggressive on rates, if you believe their talk and all of a sudden we have some drop off in demand, because that conflict expands and the nightmare scenario would be that a couple of tankers get sunk in the Persian Gulf at the narrow end and oil goes to $200 a barrel. I mean, the bets are off. But boy, if we see that scenario, I can’t think of a better business to want to be in and I hate to see that scenario happen. But actually on a relative basis, it should be good for our business, because it will mean that people will, first of all, inventory becomes really important and it means that -- it’s yet one more uncertainty like the pandemic, like the earthquake, like all these other disruptions that we have seen that will push the general posture of companies from just in time to just in case.', 'So I hate to say it would be good because it’s an awful situation that’s going there and before this is all over, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed and I don’t want to see this happen. But I don’t think its impact on the business on a relative basis is going to be terrible. I am honestly more worried about the Fed overdoing it than that conflict escalating. But those things are very hard to predict. I think that was our last question. So we really appreciate your participation. Really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day and I promise it will be really good. So take care.', 'Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference.

To be fair, we need to set some expectations. If you’re looking for absolutely blistering gains – securities that can go 3X or higher – you need to look elsewhere.', 'However, what’s the point of targeting incredibly speculative ventures that could facilitate a ten-bagger but would most likely end up losing you tons of cash? For the conservative investor, it might make better sense to get 20% returns. Sure, you’d rather get 200% but then again, you’re much likelier to extract the former potentiality. Thus, high-growth S&P 500 stocks are rewarding or sensible.', 'Or, since we’re in baseball’s playoff season, would you rather take an A-swing hack and miss or get a critical single to bat in a baserunner? Of course, singles aren’t nearly as sexy as home runs. But in the playoffs, you want to take home victories, not stat lines. On that note, below are high-growth S&P 500 stocks to consider.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Investors look to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for stable exposure to the energy market. Unless they’re playing a high-stakes game with XOM options, people aren’t usually looking to Exxon Mobil for ridiculous gains. However, on a relative basis, the stalwart makes a solid case for high-growth S&P 500 stocks.', 'No, you’re probably not going to get cryptocurrency-rich with XOM. However, when you acquire shares, you’re doing so at a reasonably favorable time for the sector. With major oil-producing nations agreeing to cut production until the end of this year, XOM could swing higher.', 'In addition, you’re getting a consistently profitable enterprise that enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9%, above 60.26% of its peers. Also, it pays out a 3.3% forward yield.\xa0Lastly, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy with a $126.88 price target, implying nearly 15% upside. Overall, that’s a decent showing from number 12 on the S&P 500 list.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Cleveland, Ohio, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) primarily engages in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of paint, coatings, floor coverings, and related products. Most of these products are aimed at the professional and industrial communities. However, retail customers also gravitate toward Sherwin-Williams. On paper, it’s a reliable but boring enterprise. Given the present context, it’s one of the high-growth S&P 500 stocks.', 'Yes, I know how strange that sounds. When you add that SHW only gained less than 6% since the January opener, the notion seems even more absurd. However, in the past one-year period, SHW gained almost 24% of equity value. Fundamentally, consistently strong demand for real estate – along with new housing construction – may lift shares.', 'Exposure to SHW gives you a consistently profitable and predictable business. Also, based on investment data aggregator Gurufocus’ proprietary calculations for intrinsic value, SHW is modestly undervalued.\xa0Analysts rate SHW a moderate buy with a $299.29 target, implying over 18% upside. Not bad for number 127 on the S&P 500 rankings.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Clocking in at number 223 on the S&P 500 list, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) doesn’t immediately come to mind as one of the high-growth S&P 500 stocks. Part of that perception stems from its negative performance. Since the beginning of this year, YUM slipped more than 5%. Unfortunately, YUM has been looking rather soft since the end of July.', 'Still, the restaurant operator – which owns several popular fast-food brands – may benefit from the trade-down effect. Basically, consumers will trade down from pricey eateries to more affordable fare, which theoretically should benefit Yum. It’s not just logic either. In a Reuters report in August, Yum beat estimates for quarterly comparable sales and profit due to stronger demand for cheaper meals at KFC.', 'Also, Yum enjoys at least a 10-year streak of net income. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate of 9.7% beats out 79.51% of its peers.\xa0In closing, analysts rate YUM a moderate buy with a $146 target, implying over 21% growth.', 'Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com', 'A medical device company, Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) features a long history, being founded in 1927.

However, Zimmer is working through its cobwebs following the Covid-19 disruption.

Since the start of the year, CTVA slipped more than 15% in equity value.', 'With that kind of print, CTVA might not seem an ideal candidate for high-growth S&P 500 stocks to buy. However, as boring as the underlying agricultural sector is, geopolitics has made (regrettably) more exciting. With adversarial nations competing for access to precious resources, the U.S. must not lag behind. From a purely cynical perspective, Corteva holds much promise.', 'Also, it may offer enticing value for forward-looking investors. Currently, shares trade at 1.37x book value. In contrast, the sector median hits a loftier 1.66x.\xa0Analysts rate CTVA a strong buy with a $68.92 target, implying over 38% upside potential.', 'Source: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com', 'Representing the consumer health component of the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) umbrella, Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) saw significant interest prior to its spinoff. However, since making its debut as a separate entity, KVUE hasn’t looked that great, to be honest. Down nearly 27% since its first public session, KVUE doesn’t appear to be one of the high-growth S&P 500 stocks.', 'However, looks might be deceiving. With some patience, Kenvue may rise higher. Ranked as number 218 on the venerable list, the company fundamentally benefits from everyday demand. While I don’t want to be cynical, the reality is that during economic hardships, people might not go to the doctor. But they’ll acquire over-the-counter meds for basic needs. Thus, Kenvue should enjoy business predictability.', 'Again, a little patience may go a long way.

Since the start of the year, NEE fell more than 38%, an uncharacteristic performance. Even worse, the negative acceleration has been severe, with shares dropping nearly 24% in the trailing one-month period.', 'As The Wall Street Journal reported, the current high interest-rate environment imposes significant headwinds against wind and solar developers. It’s so bad that the pessimism easily clouds a wave of government subsidies for green projects. Still, for the contrarian investor, NEE could be one of the enticing high-growth S&P 500 stocks.', 'Yes, the recent volatility is incredibly worrying. Nevertheless, renewable energy probably won’t go out of style given the broadly rising demand. Also, the red ink has made NEE more attractive.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL), by way of a worked example."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PPL ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for PPL is:', '5.2% = US$719m ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, PPL has a lower ROE than the average (8.3%) in the Electric Utilities industry classification."", ""That certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 2 risks we have identified for PPL visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by PPL, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.07. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Pentair plc is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

In 2023 so far, value stocks haven’t performed as well as growth stocks, falling behind in terms of returns and market performance.

In 2023 the minimum taxable income bracket for individuals is $0 to $11,000 compared to $0 to $10,275 in 2022.

And Berkshire Hathaway is betting on the solution. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households created than housing units completed. This gap is one of the key reasons for the housing unaffordability that’s already throttled many American cities and is rapidly spreading to others.', 'Naturally, this creates intense pressure to build more homes.

Unlike other random bits of “information” you might find on the Internet, the legendary investor knows what he’s talking about.', 'Primarily, Warren Buffett stocks stand the test of time. It’s no secret that the Oracle is up there in age. That he’s been so prominent through multiple changes in the market (and society) underscores the virtue of his approach. Moving away from fads and flavors of the week, Buffett instead focuses on core fundamentals. Being in this business for decades, it’s easier to trust his track record.', 'Plus, by going through the individual ideas listed in Berkshire’s holdings, one gets a sense that Buffett hasn’t lost his touch. Put another way, you don’t have to worry about whether the core strategy accounts for outside factors like monetary policy. Nothing surprises the man.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On that note, below are the top Warren Buffett stocks that can beat the market.', 'Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Reston, Virginia, Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) operates a diverse array of network infrastructure, including two of the Internet’s thirteen root nameservers. Per its public profile, Verisign represents the authoritative registry for the .com, .net, and .name generic top-level domains and the .cc country-code top-level domains. Also, it covers the back-end systems for the .jobs and .edu-sponsored top-level domains.', 'Fundamentally, Verisign ranks among the most important Warren Buffett stocks because of its criticality to digital infrastructure. Basically, the company does its job by not being recognized at all. It’s similar to how baseball fans shouldn’t know the name of the umpire calling balls and strikes. If they do, that’s a major problem.', 'Financially, I must admit that Verisign doesn’t offer the most exemplary example of attractiveness. Nevertheless, it’s consistently profitable, in part due to its blistering net margin of nearly 49%.\xa0Finally, analysts rate VRSN a moderate buy with a $239.50 target, implying 14% upside potential.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the giants of the broader healthcare umbrella, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) now focuses on its pharmaceutical and medical technologies business units. Under the present framework, that might be an ideal situation. Basically, when people find themselves in need of advanced pharmaceuticals or medical innovations, they’re going to pay up. Cynically, then, J&J may be somewhat insulated from market or economic downturns.', 'In fairness, JNJ lost more than 12% of equity value, which clashes with the performance of the benchmark equities index. Still, because of the red ink, shares got a bit more attractive from a valuation standpoint. It’s not exactly a steal. However, trading at a 14.23x forward earnings multiple, it comes in slightly better than the sector median of 15.13x.', 'Also, the other component that makes J&J worth consideration for top Warren Buffett stocks is the passive income. Offering a forward yield of 3.05%, the company commands 62 years of dividend increases.\xa0Lastly, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $178.10 target, implying 14% growth.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'Perhaps the trickiest idea among Warren Buffett stocks to consider, Floor & Decor (NYSE:FND) is a multi-channel specialty retailer of hard surface flooring and related accessories. Up until October 2021, FND skyrocketed from the depths of the post-Covid-19 lows thanks to surging demand for housing. Because of a very loose monetary policy that drove down interest rates, housing sales blossomed. In turn, so did Floor & Décor.', 'Of course, with the Federal Reserve responding with higher interest rates, that narrative looks at the very least questionable. Still, for those who believe in America – as Buffett does – and specifically the housing market, FND may offer indirect exposure. For example, a residential real estate brokerage really only has one business. However, FND can spike due to homebuying and apartment building and renovations.', 'Financially, the company benefits from robust long-term sales growth. Admittedly, revenue growth has diminished but it’s still on a positive trend.\xa0Significantly, analysts rate FND a moderate buy with a $103.88 target, implying nearly 19% upside.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'A hydrocarbon energy giant that needs no introduction, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) symbolizes one of the most important Warren Buffett stocks. True, such a statement clashes with the broader political and ideological push for clean and renewable energy integration. But guess what? Going green isn’t going to solve our energy problems and therefore, hydrocarbons will probably be relevant indefinitely.', 'I don’t want to say forever but I don’t think it’s a bad answer. Look, most of us recognize that, pound-for-pound, the U.S. is the best country in the world. I’m not trying to provoke a flame war, I’m just spitting facts as the kids like to say. Well, being the best inherently means a nation enjoys robust immigration. Thus, the population influx – combined with internal natural growth – likely means that hydrocarbons are necessities.', 'Also, while you’re watching CVX march onward, you can collect the forward dividend yield of 3.75%. Just as well, the payout ratio is reasonable at 41.18%.\xa0To close, analysts rate CVX a moderate buy with a $191.54 target, implying nearly 19% upside.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'Another tricky idea sitting among the top Warren Buffett stocks, Visa (NYSE:V) is a financial services powerhouse. Providing credit card services and electronic fund transfers, Visa represents a vital component of everyday commerce. As The Washington Post recently noted, paper checks are dead and cash is dying. So, the article ponders, who’s using them?', 'Don’t look at me, please. But yes, the Post does bring up a valid point that undergirds credit card providers like Visa. Even if you’re not using plastic to make ends meet, digital transactions have become the norm. It’s almost sacrilegious to come across a business that doesn’t accept cards – oh the horror!', 'However, what I don’t particularly like is that many households depend on plastic to make it through the month. True, credit card debt hitting just over $1 trillion reflects (in a way) confidence in the system. But what happens if that confidence erodes?\xa0For the daring – including the Oracle of Omaha – analysts rate V a strong buy with a $282.57 target, implying 20% growth.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'An enticing but now fairly risky idea for Warren Buffett stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) still has a chance to make patient investors smile. Granted, KO slipped almost 15% since the beginning of the year, which obviously isn’t ideal. As a globally popular consumer staple, KO really shouldn’t be that volatile. Still, with the red ink, it’s looking more attractive.', 'On the financial print, KO stock now trades at a forward earnings multiple of 18.65x. That’s not a resoundingly great deal, considering that the sector median comes in at 19.16X. However, at the end of last year, it carried a forward multiple of 25.45x. So, relatively speaking, it’s more attractive.', 'Fundamentally, Coca-Cola should benefit from the trade-down effect. Basically, consumers facing pressures typically don’t cut spending cold turkey. Instead, they trade down to cheaper alternatives until an acceptable equilibrium is found. Thus, Coca-Cola products could be traded down from pricey coffee shops.\xa0Analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy with a $68.67 target, implying almost 28% growth.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'With the inclusion of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) among the top Warren Buffett stocks, the Oracle confirms that he’s not just picking a bunch of boring ideas from yesteryear. Rather, he’s engaged with the contemporary ebb and flow of the equities sector. As well, with AMZN presenting risks, it demonstrates that the legendary investor is willing to gamble every now and then.', 'Yes, AMZN gained nearly 54% of equity value since the start of this year. However, things have been a bit shaky in recent sessions. For example, in the trailing one-month period, AMZN lost about 7% of its value. Still, Buffett is likely focusing on long-term consumer behaviors. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail transactions hit 15.4% in the second quarter.', 'That’s sizable considering the headwinds against the consumer economy. In full disclosure, stakeholders pay a premium for the luxury of owning AMZN. Right now, it trades at nearly 42x forward earnings, well above the underlying sector’s 13.42x. But again, we’re talking about one of the most relevant enterprises in the history of business.\xa0To reassure investors, analysts rate AMZN a strong buy with a $176.33 target, implying nearly 34% upside.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, the consensus mark for earnings indicates a 4% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The company delivered an earnings surprise of 10.8% in the last reported quarter.

The company has been witnessing muted consumer sentiments from inflation and increasing interest rates, along with unfavorable currency.Despite improvements in supply-chain conditions, Whirlpool has been witnessing supply-chain disruptions in some parts of the world. The company has also been witnessing an unfavorable product price/mix and high raw material costs. All these factors are likely to have marred its margin performance across most regions in third-quarter 2023.We anticipate the company’s gross margin to contract 350 basis points (bps) in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit is expected to increase 26.1% year over year in the quarter. The company is likely to have witnessed an increase in SG&A expenses, partly offsetting its operating margin. Our model indicates a 7% increase in SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis, with a 50-bps increase in the SG&A rate. The operating margin for the third quarter is expected to expand 210 bps to 7.6%.Nonetheless, Whirlpool is on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. The company has been implementing cost takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities, effectively managing working capital, and syncing supply chain and labor levels with demand.WHR announced significant cost-based price increases of 5-18% in various countries. The company also launched a cost takeout program worth $500 million, which is likely to have reduced fixed and variable costs. Management has been on track with its cost takeout actions and expects $800-$900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management pointed out that it was optimistic about the structural strength of its North America business.

The agency business includes business written by Progressive’s network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as brokerages in New York and California and strategic alliance business relationships (other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies). The direct business includes business written directly by the company online and over the phone.', 'The Commercial Lines (18%) segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses. The majority of its Commercial Auto customers insure two or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Lines business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the business auto and specialty truck markets. The business auto market accounts for one third of its total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 60% of the vehicles Progressive insures in this business. The remainder is in the specialty truck commercial auto market, which includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage and other short-haul commercial vehicles.', 'The Property (5%) segment writes personal property insurance, for homeowners, other property owners, and renters, in the Agency channel in over 31 states and the District of Columbia for personal property insurance and in over four states for commercial property insurance.', 'Bottom Line', ""Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Progressive ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today."", 'According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2013 would be worth $5,858.46, or a gain of 485.85%, as of October 18, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.', 'In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 152.33% and the price of gold went up 39.92% over the same time frame.', 'Analysts are anticipating more upside for PGR.', ""Progressive continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy. Shares of Progressive have outperformed the industry in a year. However, exposure to catastrophe losses induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses due to higher losses and settlement expenses remain an overhang on the margin.

Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. This fiscal year, Jon Moeller, Chairman, President and CEO, will join the mid-year and year-end calls and I'll be leading the Q1 and Q3 calls. Execution of our integrated strategy drove strong results in the July to September quarter, broad-based organic sales growth across categories and regions, global aggregate market share growth, strong productivity savings, enabling increased investment in superiority of our brands while also delivering very strong earnings growth. These strong first quarter results put us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth and core earnings per share and continued strong cash productivity and cash return to shareowners. Now moving to first quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 7%. Pricing added 7 points to sales growth and mix contributed 1 point. Volume rounded down to a decline of 1 point with overall modest volume growth outside Greater China. Top line growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home Care grew low-teens. Personal Health Care was up double digits. Feminine Care, Oral Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming each grew high single digits. Baby Care and Family Care were up mid-singles. Skin and Personal Care grew low singles. Growth was also broad-based across geographies with 5 of 7 regions growing organic sales. Focus Markets grew 6% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 7%. And Europe Focus Markets were up 15%. Greater China organic sales were down 6% versus prior year. Underlying market growth is soft and choppy as consumer confidence remains weak. SK-II was down low-teens in Greater China due to soft market conditions and a temporary reduction in social retail merchandising. Enterprise Markets were up 13% with Latin America up 19% and Europe Enterprise Markets up 15%. Shipment volume in the U.S. grew 3% again this quarter, and we returned to volume growth in Europe Focus Markets. Mexico, Brazil and India, some of our largest Enterprise Markets, continue to deliver solid volume growth. These gains largely offset volume declines in the Greater China, Asia-Pacific and European enterprise regions, primarily driven by underlying market contraction. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with 32 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all-outlet value share was up 50 basis points versus prior year with 7 of 10 categories holding or growing value share in the quarter. U.S. volume share was up 60 basis points, reflecting 3% volume growth. Value share in European Focus Markets was up 40 basis points over the past 3 months. Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.83, up 17% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 21%. Core operating margin increased 240 basis points as 460 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation and foreign exchange impacts on SG&A. Currency-neutral operating margin increased 340 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 210 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 97%. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, a very good start to the fiscal year across top line, bottom line and cash. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past 5 years. And that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily-use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value across each price tier we compete. We are again raising bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in the volatile environment we're in. Finally, an organization that is more empowered, agile and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with four focus areas: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and the employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. Moving to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs to currencies to consumer and geopolitical dynamics. We attempt to reflect these realities in our guidance ranges. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in July. However, within this estimate, there have been several moving parts. We've seen incremental relief on some commodities like pulp, which have been offset by higher costs in other commodities, such as fuel. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us. And we now expect a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax, an incremental $600 million impact since our initial guidance for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits. And we expect higher year-on-year net interest expense of approximately $200 million after tax. As we are just 1 quarter to the fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for organic sales, core EPS growth, cash productivity and cash return to shareowners with each solidly on track after a very strong first quarter. Guidance for organic sales is growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. The range includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that is likely to occur through calendar year '24 as the market laps the last wave of cost recovery pricing and as market volumes return to growth. For P&G, we expect 3 to 4 points less pricing benefit in each of the next 2 quarters compared to our first quarter results. On the bottom line, our outlook for fiscal '24 core earnings per share is 6% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. We're holding the range despite the incremental $600 million after-tax headwind from foreign exchange. With now a 7 point EPS impact from FX, this outlook translates to 13% to 16% core EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock. Combined, we plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. As you consider the cadence of earnings for the year, keep in mind that the back half of the year will see less pricing benefit as we progressively annualize prior year increases. We should also see less commodity benefit as we move through the year. Labor inflation continues throughout the supply chain and in our cost. FX headwinds will increase versus quarter 1. Also, with a strong start to the year, we'll be reinvesting to further strengthen our plans and to maintain strong momentum. Finally, we'll be closely watching the health of the China market and the balance of regions. Energy costs are rising as we head into fall and winter. Household saving levels have reduced, especially in Europe. Slower economic growth, higher energy costs and higher interest rates for longer have an impact on consumer confidence. To conclude, while we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we remain confident in our strategy and the results that it delivers. We are focused on driving growth in our categories. And we are committed to delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation for our shareowners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""I guess, just picking up on your comments on organic growth over the balance of the year, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the progression of price versus volume versus mix over the remainder of the year. And then I'm curious as to whether your approach to balancing those various drivers differs at all between your focus markets, particularly the U.S. and the Enterprise Markets, where you're experiencing more of the currency headwinds."", 'Andre Schulten', ""As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect the market to return to a lower, more sustainable growth rate, more in line with historical growth at around 4%. That will have a stronger contribution on the volume side. We would expect that to be around 2% -- 1% to 2% of pricing and maybe 1 point of mix impact. That will occur over the next few quarters. And as always, P&G is intending to grow ahead of the market. So really, our expectation for the year is to be slightly ahead of the market in terms of volume and slightly ahead in terms of price. We continue to believe that we can price with strong innovation. And we have gained even more confidence over the past 2 years that our strategy of pricing with innovation to drive superiority and create value for the consumer is working. And so we fully expect to return to that pattern. And again, pricing has been a core component of our growth for 18 out of the last 19 years, so we expect that to continue. Specifically, I think the pricing will start to lap in quarter 2. So you will see probably the price contribution drop to -- by 3 to 4 points in quarter 2. And that was expected. And we then sequentially expect volumes to pick up and offset part of that but do expect a lower overall market growth rate for the balance of the year. To your second part of the question, Enterprise Markets versus focus markets, I think the only differential would be foreign exchange. And we'll continue to price for foreign exchange. We've done that very successfully across the world. Turkey is a major example, where we've been able to price for the significant devaluation of the Turkish lira. But we are able to grow share, grow sales, grow profit. We'll continue that model. Outside of that, we'll continue to do and drive the same business model we're driving in focus markets, innovate, drive superiority, price, grow markets and thereby grow sales, profit and share."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.', 'Dara Warren Mohsenian', ""So just to follow up on that, can you characterize what you're seeing competitively in terms of the pricing environment? Obviously, it will be different by geography and product category. But in general, what type of behavior are you seeing from your competitors? And any thoughts around retailer pushback as commodities have turned favorable year-over-year? And just then in terms of volume growth, it sounds like we should expect a return to volume growth. Just what you think your level of visibility is around that and how much comfort you have in ultimately returning to volume growth as pricing drops off?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""When you look at the total market, it's very consistent with previous periods. You still see average market growth of around 6% to 7%. And you see still the price component being a significant driver. Volumes are stabilizing at a global level, minus 1 point to flat, depending on the geography you look at, the only exception being Greater China. So the price component and the price rollover is consistent period-over-period. So no differentiation there from a competitive standpoint, at least not that we see it. Promotion continues to be -- promotion levels and other indicator continue to be below pre-COVID levels. In the U.S., for example, volumes sold on deal is now at about 29%. Overall promotion levels still [indexed 80] versus pre COVID. In Europe, we also see promotions still down and actually sequentially decreasing. Now it's a different dynamic by market obviously but only aggregate up. It looks like over the past few quarters, promotion activity is actually still decreasing. And that makes sense. If you look at the relatively little or small help to commodity costs, we see about $800 million after-tax help offset by about $1 billion of foreign exchange. And recall, we're coming from 2 years, which combined have an impact of $7 billion of headwinds. So I think everybody is still recovering, so the current pricing dynamic makes sense. We have not experienced retailer pushback beyond normal discussions on how to maximize value for their shoppers and for consumers overall. And again, our model of driving innovation and therefore superiority and sales while we price and create value for retailers and shoppers seems to be resonating. On the volume side, we feel very good about where we are in the trajectory of volume growth. Again, excluding China, we're already seeing volume growth of 20 basis points, sequential improvement in -- versus the prior quarters, which we would have expected. And again, that's in the context of 7% pricing still flowing into the market. We expect volumes will continue to grow. U.S., strong, as we said, Europe, strong, Latin America and India are strong. So we continue to see us progressing on that trajectory."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.', 'Robert Edward Ottenstein', 'I want to drill in on China a little bit. Number one, kind of in the short term, how is the business there progressing? Any visibility or improvement there? And when do you think that may turn positive? And a little bit longer term or kind of strategically, we are hearing from some of the other companies we talk to that the Chinese market may not be as profitable and attractive as perhaps they may have thought a number of years ago and that perhaps the nature of competition is changing in China again, so love to get your thoughts on both China in the short term and the long term.', 'Andre Schulten', ""Thanks, Rob. I think we said all along that we don't expect the China recovery to be quick, extensive or linear. And I think that's playing out. The business health in China is really all driven by market dynamics right now. So total market volume continues to be down. It has been down over the past few quarters, between 7% and 9%. Value is down around 5% over the past few quarters. And that's the market I'm describing. So we're operating within a market that is still contracting post-COVID reopening. That said, we do believe that China continues to be an attractive place for us to do business. We've been there for 30 years. We have a very strong organization on the ground, R&D capability, supply chain capability and commercial capability. The Chinese consumer is a demanding consumer. The Chinese retail environment is a demanding retail environment. And that generally plays to our strength. So we believe that, a, we can play a value-creating role in China, and we expect the Chinese market to return to mid-single-digit growth here over the coming periods. If you just look at the consumer structures, middle-income consumers, we have about 450 million, we estimate, in China today. That will grow probably north of 700 million over the next 5 years. So there is a class of consumers that we believe are attractive for our businesses. And therefore, we believe that our business in China can create significant value over the next few years. And we'll continue to remain invested."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""You've mentioned a return to volume growth in European Focus Markets, which is great to see. And obviously, market shares have generally held up well. But we started to see some pickup in private label share trends across Europe. You mentioned the European consumer being under pressure. So just kind of curious, maybe some more broad thoughts there on Europe on market share trends that you're seeing more real time versus what's kind of already transpired in the reported results, more the go-forward look, on European shares and volume trends?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Thank you. Look, the European -- let me focus here on the Western European side because I think that's where your question is relevant. Look, we've seen 15% organic sales growth in Europe Focus Markets, which is incredibly strong, a combination of 2% volume growth and strong price/mix. We have 40 basis points of share growth across the same geographies, which is very encouraging. The market is returning to volume growth. And that generally are positive signs. Yes, private label shares in Europe are growing. They continue to grow at about an 80 basis point clip month-over-month. But that still enables us to grow share in the same geographies. And I think that share growth is enabled by a strong portfolio across different brand tiers, across different cash outlays. The fact that we are present in all relevant channels across Europe, and that allows us to effectively compete. Even as consumers look at the private label versus branded value creation, the balance seems to be still in our favor."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.', 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', ""I guess, I have two connected questions. One is if we look at first quarter and even your commentary about guidance maybe higher end of the range, I know you've talked a lot -- you've talked a bit about some of the risks in the market. But just like what's been better so far this year is one question, so just that. And then related to that also, you talked about reinvestment. So if you can just give us some sense of kind of the sizing of that reinvestment and maybe where those dollars are going."", 'Andre Schulten', ""If you look at the first quarter, I think the -- we are encouraged by the combination of factors here on the consumption side. Again, volume -- return to volume growth outside of China, we expect China to be choppy as we said all along. But even with China down, we've been able to grow -- and that certainly has been encouraging to us. And the depth and breadth of that growth, both across value and volume outside of China, is really encouraging us and giving us confidence that the model will continue to drive results that point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. On the reinvestment side, we will continue to look for opportunities to invest when the return of that investment is attractive. It won't be driven by availability of funds. It will be driven by ability to create an attractive return. Our first priority, as you can imagine, in this current environment is to invest in ideas that drive market growth. So investing in products, investing in innovation that is driving new jobs to be done, investing in media spending that is driving household penetration, investing in communication to the consumer that drives usage in the right way to drive better delight for the consumer will be key. A couple of examples. Ninjamas in bedwetting was a sleepy category. We entered a couple of years ago. The category is growing 7%. We were able to drive 60% of that growth, which is 6x our fair share. Those are great examples where we can continue to invest, drive growth for the business, drive for our retailers and create value for shareholders. We continue to see opportunities in media. As we get sharper and sharper on our targeting across media around the world and our capabilities of scale, the ROI gets better. So we'll continue to drive up reach. We continue to drive up frequency. And again, that is a core driver for us, to drive household penetration, drive trial, which will turn into loyalty and repeat. The last bucket I will give you is investing in supply resilience and productivity. Our supply chain resilience, we see as a core competitive advantage for our retail partners and for ourselves. So we'll continue to ensure that our capacity to demand ratio is where we want it to be. And investing in productivity, we believe, has a high payout and is critical for us to continue the investment in superiority, which is part of the business model. So those are the headlines. But be reassured, we'll do it on a very disciplined basis with return on investment as the top priority."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""Andre, your comments about volume, I would like to drill down a little bit. You mentioned China. I believe you are still looking to a mid-single-digit growth. And obviously, I understand the choppiness of the market. And you had SK-II down in the low-teens. So I'm assuming for that to happen, you're expecting SK-II to gradually improve or lap easier comps as we go through the balance of the year. And then when you mentioned -- like doing the math when you said pricing, as we decompose your guidance, right, the 4% to 5% for organic total company, you mentioned expect sequential 3% to 4% decline in the benefit of pricing, right? So it was a good 7%, so you would be implying towards 3% to 4% in the next 2 quarters. So with that being said, it implies in the next 2 quarters, some sort of improvement in volume, right, or at least some sort of inflection. So I was trying to figure that out in the context of what you said about China and what you said about total company, basically what it regresses to, it regresses to an improvement in China? Is that what we should be thinking?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""So first part of your question, we obviously want to see SK-II return to growth. But the volume impact of SK-II is relatively limited. Because the volume-to-organic sales ratio obviously is very high unit sales. So China, we believe, will return to mid-single-digit growth. When exactly that's going to happen is really hard to predict. And I would say, like we have delivered 7% organic sales growth in the first quarter with China down, I think we'll continue to operate and not counting on China recovery as the core catalyst to growth for the coming quarters. On your sequential question on volume, you're right. As we said, the pricing contribution to organic sales growth will decrease 3 to 4 points over the coming quarters. And we expect volume to progress sequentially. The exact trajectory of that progression, I think, is questionable. And I won't make a prediction here. But I'll tell you that the progress we're seeing from minus 6 to minus 3 to flat -- to minus 1 to now flat is pointing in that right direction. So we see we're on the right path. And we will continue to invest to drive wholesale penetration and create that volume growth in our business."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.', 'Olivia Tong Cheang', ""Andre, you talked about the changes in FX and how you've been able to absorb that into the fiscal year outlook. Can you discuss what's embedded in your outlook in terms of the consumer, the economy? Obviously, increasing risk or concerns around trade-downs, lower volumes and macros in general, so if you could talk about that. And then also your ability and -- your agility to switch between spending that is either net to sales versus operating in light of potentially volatile conditions."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Yes. Thanks, Olivia. Look, the consumer continues to be remarkably resilient. As we said in the U.S., the consumption levels are actually stable. Our volume share and our value share are growing. And that's true in Europe and in most parts of the world. And I interpret that as our portfolio doing exactly the job that it's supposed to do. And building a portfolio that is grounded in superiority in daily-use categories that are nondiscretionary, I think, is serving us extremely well. We're able to add value, bring value to the consumer. And we are doing that in every tier, not just in the premium tier but in the mid-tier and in value tiers across the world, which allows us to serve the consumer even as their spending preferences might change. Now we haven't seen a significant change in their preference yet. If anything, consumers that are choosing P&G products continue to trade up within our portfolio. But you can see our ability to grow in markets even when we see private label shares expand. And so we don't expect a significant change in that profile. And we believe we are well set up to grow even if the consumer feels a bit more of a pinch here going into the fall or winter season. The main intervention for us continues to be investing in innovation and continue to invest in media supports to communicate the strength and the value that our brands can provide. We don't see a significant need to drive price promotion. Our focus, if we promote, if we look for in-store support is really to drive regimen. So we view it as a strategic tool to drive either trial or habit formation, i.e., regimen steps added to the laundry regime or the hair care regime, for example. Because that drives incremental consumption. It drives growth for our retail partners and for us. In many cases, our innovation is strong enough to get in-store support. And that's really what we're after. When the product in and of itself generates enough traffic and consumption, so retailers want to support it, that's the goal we're going after."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Christopher Michael Carey', ""I was wondering if you could expand on two categories, which have been important for volume growth and seemingly should be important ahead. Just first on laundry, we've seen an improvement, a reacceleration in trends. Can you just expand on what's driving that and the durability? And then second, in Personal Health Care, I believe that was an important driver of volume growth in the quarter. Can you just expand on what exactly was driving that in the quarter and if you think those trends are also sustainable go-forward? So I'm just trying to get a sense of some of the volume durability that we saw in the quarter go-forward, specifically in the context of potentially some volatility out of China likely to persist."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Yes. Thanks, Chris. The laundry business is very encouraging. Results around the world are very strong. Let me focus on the U.S. market because that's -- it's the biggest market and you have the highest visibility to. But if you look at the trends, they are very encouraging. We are now growing value and volume share in U.S. Fabric Care. Value share has been flat over the past 3 months. Volume share has been up 1.6 points. So we continue to push the laundry business forward. We have record-high fabric enhancer shares. And we have record-high laundry consumption in the U.S. Most importantly, I think, is the fact that we're driving 70% of the category growth in laundry. And we're driving 100% of the category growth in fabric enhancers. And it's really driven by strong innovation, strong superiority and doubling down on consumer-relevant communication and in-store support. So I fully believe that this will only accelerate. And to your question, yes, it is sustainable because it's just in line with the business model. PHC is doing extremely well around the world. And obviously, the seasonality here plays a key role. Going into the season, we see strong results, which is part of the strength in volumes that you see. And the last part I'll leave you with is we've invested significantly and continue to invest in strengthening our supply capability in Personal Health Care, which will be needed to support that strong growth going forward. But feel good about both businesses, and yes, I think the trajectory is absolutely sustainable."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', ""Just a question on gross margin, clearly very strong, the performance in the quarter, big inflection in terms of the year-over-year increase. You seem like you have pretty good visibility in the first half, at least on the commodity front. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking the second half will play out, especially as pricing contribution comes down?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Yes, when we talked about the cadence of earnings, I think it's important to understand the drivers of the gross margin expansion we saw in quarter 1. And we expect some normalization of gross margin. We were certainly benefiting from a high price contribution in quarter 1. And as we said, that price contribution will ease over the coming quarters. The biggest part of the commodity help, about 33% of the $800 million after-tax commodity help has materialized in quarter 1. So that's a positive to gross margin relative to the balance of the year. And the foreign exchange rate headwinds will accelerate over the coming quarters. On the other hand, we will accelerate and continue to drive strong productivity. We will continue to drive trade-up and innovation. And we continue to drive every other element of productivity, not only in gross margin but across the P&L and the balance sheet. But I want you to take away that the gross margin expansion in quarter 1 is very strong. But we have headwinds going into the balance of the year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""So I wanted to ask specifically on Latin America, 19% growth in the quarter, very strong. And you may have alluded to this. But are you already seeing a return to volume growth in the region? And then just thinking through the performance in the quarter, can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing in terms of broader category performance versus how much of this growth is a function of share gains?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Look, the Latin America business is on fire. And I think it is on fire because we've chosen maybe opposite to the market to double down on superiority. When we saw the need to price for foreign exchange and commodity impacts in Latin America, the team made the choice to double down on innovation and price for the innovation and to offset foreign exchange rate, inflation and commodities. And that clearly has played out well. We are seeing growth in our categories. And we are seeing share growth in Latin America. The growth is both on the volume side and on the value side in the biggest markets, in Brazil, Mexico, for example. I think the biggest headwind that we have to acknowledge is Argentina, where it's very difficult to make progress at this point in time, given the level of inflation, some constraints in terms of ability to price. So outside of Argentina, I can only paint a very positive picture of the Latin America growth construction. And again, it's grounded in the superiority of our brands. And I feel very strong about the sustainability of that model."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.', 'Mark Stiefel Astrachan', ""Two sort of unrelated follow-ups. One, just on China, given your commentary about the middle class, I think everybody is obviously aware that there's just a growing middle class and that they'll ultimately consume more. But any sort of changes in your view about how quickly the middle class premiumizes purchases? Obviously, SK-II is maybe sort of a one-off. But any changes there in terms of how quickly you think that they can go for more premium-priced products? Does that potentially change how Procter thinks about its product positioning or portfolio positioning in the market? And then on the gross margin versus marketing spend sort of decision tree, if gross margin moderates, how do we think about the incremental reinvestment or marketing investment from an SG&A standpoint through the year? Would that inversely kind of move with gross margin? Or I should say, would it move with gross margin, meaning less gross margin expansion, less reinvestment?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Yes. Look, I really don't have any more insights on the China recovery timing. You see the volatility in the market. That will directly correlate with consumer confidence, income levels and therefore recovery timing. I think we're hoping for faster, but we're prepared for longer would be my answer here. On the gross margin versus marketing spending side, when I say we're ROI-driven, I really mean we're ROI-driven. So there's no direct correlation between availability of funds and investment levels. If we continue to see strong response to the marketing spend, increases that we deliver in quarter 1, I think there's a strong incentive for us to continue that level of investment. I also expect that our gross margin expansion and our overall growth contribution availability will continue to enable us to drive strong innovation and drive strong support of those innovations. That's part of the business model. That's why again it has to be a combination of driving very strong productivity to reinvest in superiority, to grow markets. And we have to keep that cycle spinning."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic.', 'Edward James Lewis', ""Another strong quarter in the U.S., seeing both volume and value growth. Just looking back at 2020, where we were dealing with obviously a lot of COVID headwinds, you were talking about growing about 4% to 6% as a sustainable rate of growth in the U.S. In light of all that's gone on in the past few years and seeing where we are in the U.S. at the moment with the consumer, are you still comfortable with that range over the longer term?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Look, I won't give you guidance on a market-by-market basis. I think the -- what is proving out is that the business model we're driving in the U.S. is very successful. If we are successful in continuing to drive market growth, that will continue to drive sales ahead of that market growth for us while being sustainable because we create business instead of taking business from somebody else.If that model is successful, which I believe it will, I feel very strongly about the growth prospects of the U.S. And again, we're doubling down in every dimension of superiority. We're doubling down in every dimension of market execution. So my overall confidence in the U.S. market capability and growth trajectory is very high."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time.', 'Andre Schulten', ""Okay. Thank you very much for joining us today. Again, very strong first quarter in the year, and we'll look forward to speaking with you. If you have any questions, John and I will be available all day. So please feel free to call or e-mail. Thank you very much."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

(FFO)', 'FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended in December 2018, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.', ""The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including the Company's ability to make cash distributions."", 'Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)', ""FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as FFO plus non-real estate depreciation, allowance for straight line credit loss, adjustment for straight line operating lease rent, non-cash deferred compensation, and pro-rata adjustments for these items from the Company's unconsolidated JVs, less straight line rental income, free rent net of amortization, second cycle tenant improvement and leasing costs, and recurring capital expenditures."", 'FAD is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is not indicative of cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. FAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure with respect to liquidity because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company’s ability to fund its dividends. Because all companies do not calculate FAD the same way, the presentation of FAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. FAD does not represent cash flow from operating, investing and finance activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.', 'Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre)', ""EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures."", 'The Company presents EBITDAre because the Company believes that EBITDAre, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.', 'Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI', 'NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as operating income before transaction related costs, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt, marketing general and administrative expenses and non-real estate revenue. Cash NOI is also a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by subtracting free rent (net of amortization), straight-line rent, and the amortization of acquired above and below-market leases from NOI, while adding operating lease straight-line adjustment and the allowance for straight-line tenant credit loss.', ""The Company presents NOI and Cash NOI because the Company believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and reconciliations, provide investors with meaningful information regarding the operating performance of properties. When operating performance is compared across multiple periods, the investor is provided with information not immediately apparent from net income that is determined in accordance with GAAP.

Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 18% in the last quarter. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. It's fair to say most would be happy with 198% the gain in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today."", ""While the stock has fallen 5.7% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals."", ' Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, D.R. Horton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 24% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 7.12.', 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'We know that D.R. Horton has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling D.R. Horton stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.', ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, D.R. Horton's TSR for the last 5 years was 215%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's good to see that D.R. Horton has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 53% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 26% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with D.R.

By comparison, real GDP actually expanded at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 while unemployment is at just 3.9%. Nevertheless, workers and investors still have to deal with inflation and the housing crisis, which are bound to lead to dissatisfaction.', 'Investing in this environment is difficult but not impossible. Indeed, Munger, Buffett and other billionaires are beating the economic gloom with savvy investments. Following their lead could help you supercharge your finances during tough economic times — and hopefully help improve your perspective on the state of affairs in the process.', 'The housing crisis is a genuine issue. And Berkshire Hathaway is betting on the solution. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households created than housing units completed. This gap is one of the key reasons for the housing unaffordability that’s already throttled many American cities and is rapidly spreading to others.', 'Naturally, this creates intense pressure to build more homes. That’s why Buffett and Munger added stakes in some of the largest homebuilders to his portfolio. During the second quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway added D.R. Horton (DHI) , NVR Inc. (NVR) and Lennar Corp. (LEN), highlighting the fact that even during economic crises, there’s always an opportunity to bet on the remedies.', 'In September 2023, the number of privately owned housing completions rose by 1.0% from the previous year.

Berkshire has been accumulating shares of oil and gas producers for several quarters. Now, Chevron Corp (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are the fifth and sixth largest holdings in the Berkshire portfolio, respectively.', 'Energy companies are underrated and undervalued at the moment, given their cash flows. Occidental, for instance, trades at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 7.2. These stocks are cheap, which perfectly fits Buffett and Munger’s strategy.', 'Health care spending is untethered to the economy. During the Great Recession of 2008, the number of visits to hospitals and purchases of pharmaceuticals didn’t drop. In the most recent crisis, health care spending actually surged because we were dealing with a pandemic. This phenomenon has led some academics to label hospitals and pharmaceutical companies “recession-proof.”', 'Buffett and Munger could be aware of this fact. Dialysis provider Davita Inc.

With mortgage rates soaring to a 23-year high, the industry is experiencing its lowest levels of sentiment since January 2023. According to the National Association of Home Builders (“NAHB”) report released on Oct 17, the Monthly Housing Market Index (HMI) reading paints a bleak picture for the market.', 'Builder confidence in newly built single-family homes fell by four points to 40 in October, marking the third consecutive monthly drop in sentiment. All three major HMI indices declined, with the index for current sales conditions dropping four points to 46, the sales expectations in the next six months plummeting five points to 44, and the gauge for traffic of prospective buyers dipping four points to 26.', ""One major factor contributing to this decline is the surge in mortgage rates, which have remained above 7% for the past two months. Higher rates are deterring potential buyers, particularly younger ones, who are finding themselves priced out of the market. Additionally, the increased cost and availability of builder development and construction loans are hurting the supply, further damaging housing affordability.According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.57% for the week ending Oct 12, 2023. This was an eight-point increase from the previous week. The last time rates were this high was in December 2000. This surge was driven by the Federal Reserve's higher-for-longer monetary policy stance, strong third-quarter economic growth, and concerns over government budget deficits.The housing affordability crisis remains a significant challenge. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz highlighted that the solution lies in adding attainable, affordable supply. Increasing housing production is vital in tackling shelter inflation, which was responsible for over half of the Consumer Price Index's rise in September. Additionally, this would align with the Federal Reserve's mission to bring inflation back down to 2%. However, monetary policy uncertainty is adding to the affordability issues in the market."", 'To combat the impact of high-interest rates, many builders are slashing home prices to stimulate sales. In October, 32% of builders reported cutting home prices, a rate unchanged from the previous month but the highest since December 2022. The average price discount remains at 6%. Furthermore, 62% of builders offered sales incentives of all forms in October, up from 59% in September, tying with the previous high set in December 2022.', ""The decline in builder confidence in the face of soaring mortgage rates is a concerning trend for the homebuilding industry. Challenges stemming from higher rates, monetary policy uncertainty, and an affordability crisis are putting pressure on builders. The industry must navigate these obstacles to continue providing housing solutions for a growing population.The hope for a rebound in sentiment largely depends on the trajectory of these rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Until then, the market is likely to see builders continuing to make price cuts and offering incentives to entice buyers.In this challenging environment, potential homebuyers may discover chances to acquire a new residence at more budget-friendly rates. However, the industry's journey to resurgence critically relies on steering through the tumultuous waters of elevated mortgage rates and economic unpredictability. The housing market's future will continue to be intricately linked to the choices and initiatives of the Federal Reserve in the forthcoming months."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Notably, homebuilders like Lennar Corporation LEN, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, Meritage Homes Corporation MTH, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and KB Home KBH have declined 16.1%, 17.9%, 21.5%, 10.3% and 18.5%, respectively, over the past three months.

Lennar has been benefiting from its digital marketing initiatives and a dynamic pricing model. Also, land-lighter strategy and effective cost-control measures.

Its EPS estimate for fiscal 2023 has increased to $6.92 from $6.29 over the past 30 days.Meanwhile, spec strategy implementation and focus on the growing demand for entry-level homes with its LiVE.NOW products have been benefiting Meritage Homes. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains vulnerable to higher mortgage rates, supply-related constraints, and higher land, labor and material costs.On the other hand, D.R.

(the Company) sometimes uses financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate its current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company is providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The tables below present the reconciliations of the following GAAP measures to their non-GAAP measures: - Operating Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Operating Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Operating Margin (GAAP measure) to Operating Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Pre-Tax Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Income (Loss) Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Pre-Tax Margin (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Net Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Net Income (Loss) Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (GAAP measure) to Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand the Company’s core operating performance. Additionally, the tables below present the reconciliations of total operating costs (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure) and total operating costs per ASM (CASM) to CASM excluding net special items and fuel. Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel and CASM excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which the Company has no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze the Company’s non-fuel costs and core operating performance."", '\xa0', '\xa0',

The Company defines free cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities, adjusted for (1) net purchases of short-term investments and (2) change in restricted cash.

The market size of the manganese market was more than $20 billion at the end of 2021. And the sector is anticipated to grow to at least $44 billion by the end of this decade. The reason is that there is a rising demand for steel items in the construction and infrastructure sector.

For the conservative investor, it might make better sense to get 20% returns. Sure, you’d rather get 200% but then again, you’re much likelier to extract the former potentiality.

But here’s a little secret: The Fed never has a clue what it will do. In May 2022, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, ‘a 75 basis point increase is not something that the committee is actively considering.’ The next month, the Fed started doing exactly that – three times in a row.”', 'Those actions were designed to curb soaring inflation. To be fair, that’s what happened, although it hardly surprised Fisher, who reminds investors that last December he explained why inflation would wane and that it would just take time to do so. Since then, inflation has faded, and it will keep declining, while the bull market will keep pushing ahead, he says.', '“The Fed’s 2% annual inflation rate goal is a done deal, just not in the numbers yet. The takeaway: This post-July stock slump is much like the one we saw in December and in the late winter, just slightly bigger and longer from a higher base. Each hiccup sets the stage for the bull market’s next leg up,” Fisher explained.', 'So, with the bull market set up for more gains, Fisher, who has a net worth of ~7.1 billion, has an idea about which stocks are the ones to take advantage of its resumption. We ran pair of his picks through the TipRanks database to see what the Street experts make of their chances. Here are the details.', 'ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)', 'For our first Fisher-backed name, we’ll turn to the software space and check the details on ServiceNow, a cloud-based platform that offers a comprehensive suite of software solutions designed to streamline and automate various business processes.', 'The company is known for its exceptional capabilities in IT service management (ITSM), allowing organizations to efficiently manage and resolve IT issues, incidents, and requests. ServiceNow also excels in providing tools for IT operations management (ITOM), enabling businesses to gain greater visibility into their IT infrastructure and optimize its performance. Beyond IT, the platform extends its functionality to various other departments, including HR, customer service, and security operations, making it a versatile enterprise service management solution.', 'Like many in the tech space, NOW has enjoyed the spoils of the 2023 bull market, with shares having gained 45% year-to-date. In the last quarter reported, for 2Q23, revenue climbed by 23% year-over-year to $2.15 billion, surpassing the Street’s call by $20 million. Adj. EPS of $2.37 also outpaced the consensus estimate by $0.32.', 'For Ken Fisher’s part, he remains long and strong here. His current NOW holdings total 1,370,996 shares, amounting to a market value of $770 million.', 'While the stock has performed well this year, against a backdrop of high-interest rates, there have been concerns among investors about decelerating growth. However, this is not a problem foreseen by HSBC analyst Stephen Bersey, who remains confident in NOW’s trajectory.', '“We estimate that ServiceNow will continue to demonstrate above-peer performance in 2023e and turnover rising by 23.2% to USD8.92bn,” the 5-star analyst said. “This is above the 22.9% y-o-y growth rate in 2022, and we believe demand conditions remain strong for the company. Fueling this strength, we think that the company’s TAM is large and growing rapidly due to the recent traction in cloud adoptions and digital transformations. For the next year, we estimate that the company will approach a run-rate of USD3bn for revenue by Q4 FY23e and estimate revenue at USD11.1bn for 2024e, growing by 24.4% per annum.”', '“We are impressed with the level of growth demonstrated by the company at a high absolute level, and we can recall just a few software companies that have demonstrated this level of growth at a similar scale,” Bersey went on to say.', 'These comments underpin Bersey’s Buy rating on NOW, while his $704 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 25%. (To watch Bersey’s track record, click here)', 'That take gets almost unanimous support on Wall Street. One analyst currently remains on the sidelines, but all 25 others say Buy, naturally resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The $642.40 average target implies shares will post growth of 14% in the year ahead. (See ServiceNow stock forecast)', 'Union Pacific (UNP)', 'Let’s now pivot to something completely different and take a look at Union Pacific, a prominent American transportation and railroad company with a rich history dating all the way back to its founding in 1862.', 'The company holds a significant place in the nation’s development and is renowned for its vast network of railroads that connect the eastern and western parts of the United States. Union Pacific primarily operates in the western two-thirds of the country, providing essential freight and transportation services across a diverse range of industries. The company plays a pivotal role in the transportation of goods, including agricultural products, energy resources, industrial commodities, and consumer goods, thereby facilitating economic growth and connectivity within the US.', 'While the company remains essential to the infrastructure of North America, its latest quarterly readout for Q2 had misses both on the top and bottom lines. Revenue fell by 5% year-over-year to $5.96 billion, falling short of expectations by $160 million. EPS of $2.57 missed the forecast by $0.20, falling short by $0.20.', 'Investors, however, felt somewhat compensated by the announcement of a new CEO, with Jim Vena returning to the company to take hold of the CEO reins from Lance Fritz. Vena served as chief operating officer between 2019 and 2020 and as the chairman’s senior advisor in 2021.', 'Meanwhile, Fisher has a significant stake in the company, currently owning 5,657,912 UNP shares, which represent a market value of $1.17 billion.', 'The company also has a fan in RBC analyst Walter Spracklin, who recommends UNP as a ‘high-conviction idea’ and thinks the new CEO is the right one for the job.', '“We believe that UNP will deliver further operational progress despite volume headwinds,” opined the 5-star analyst. “Following the announcement that Jim Vena will be UNP’s CEO, we expect that his strong operating philosophy will result in a marked turnaround in operating performance, which we expect will drive O/R and service more toward PSR peers. While cadence of the improvement will be of focus, we have assumed this turnaround is achieved by 2025, resulting in midteen EPS CAGR (with risk to the upside) out to 2025.”', '“We also believe that UNP’s competitive dynamics – unparalleled access to Mexico and the chemicals sector in the U.S. Gulf Coast – provide favourable growth prospects in the long run relative to peers,” Spracklin further said.', 'Conveying his confidence, Spracklin rates UNP shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy) and his $282 price target indicates share growth of 36% lies in store for the coming year. (To watch Spracklin’s track record, click here)', 'Elsewhere on the Street, the stock claims an additional 13 Buys and 8 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $246.41 average target, a year from now, investors will be sitting on returns of ~19%. Investors should also be aware that UNP provides a regular dividend.

The collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians have aided the company in the elevated demand for services, which reflects a continued return to care. With the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reducing over the past few quarters, the company’s base business profitability has improved compared with the pandemic-laden phase till the first half of 2022.Across Physician Lab Services, a large number of strategic partnerships with health plans involve value-based arrangements, which are leading to faster growth and share gains than traditional relationships. These arrangements make Quest Diagnostics well-positioned to be a more strategic partner with health plans, cooperating on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs. In addition, the recent acquisition of New York-Presbyterian's outreach assets also added to volume growth from physicians.Within Hospital labs, progress in terms of partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health is particularly encouraging in the Professional Lab Services (“PLS”) business, which witnessed a strong second quarter.

To help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many companies are trying to figure out what their carbon footprint is so they can start making changes.', 'Carbon accounting, or GHG accounting, is the process in which an organization estimates the total amount of GHG emissions that are generated through its activities within a set of boundaries. The predominant standard used to guide these estimations is the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, first launched in 2001.The GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage GHG emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions.', 'Defining and quantifying GHG emissions', 'GHGs were first defined in 1997, under the Kyoto Protocol, and were limited to a set of six individual GHGs or classes of GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) was added later for a total of seven gases that organizations following the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard report on.(1)', ""The defined standards set through the GHG Protocol are important because they give companies the same standard to follow when they report on emissions. This in turn makes it easier for people to compare companies' performance."", 'In general, GHGs are reported in units of carbon dioxide equivalents or CO2e. CO2e is a way of combining the seven gases into one unit, by looking at their effects on our environment over 100 years. If you think of GHGs as a currency, think of CO2e as being the one currency everyone uses, and you can swap currencies based on their exchange rate or so-called ""emission factors"". Emission factors allow us to convert various activity data into GHG emissions and combine them into our one unit, CO2e.', 'As an example, if you consumed 100 kWh of electricity, to estimate the emissions you would multiply that data by your emission factor. If we used the 2023 emission factors from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we would multiply the 100 kWh by 0.386 kg CO2e/kWh which means you would generate 38.6 kg CO2e.', 'As a reminder, emissions of organizations are classified into 3 scopes:', 'Scope 1: Direct emissions from operations owned by the company. Examples: Heating fuel used in company buildings, fuel use in company vehicles', 'Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling. Example: Electricity used in company buildings', ""Scope 3: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain. Examples: Employee business travel and commuting, supplier emissions, emissions from transportation and distribution of product, emissions from use of sold products"", 'Prior to quantifying an organization\'s GHG emissions, it\'s important to understand the time boundaries reported on across the Scope 1, 2 and 3 inventory per the GHG Protocol. While Scopes 1 and 2 look at emissions from the reporting year, categories in Scope 3 can look at past, present, or future years.(2) The GHG Protocol takes a lifecycle perspective, which means for certain categories, like ""Scope 3, Category 11: Use of Sold Products,"" an organization accounts for all of a product\'s lifetime emissions in the year it\'s sold.', 'Estimating GHG emissions', 'Carbon accounting is based on estimations. In general, there are three primary methods of estimating GHG emissions: Activity based, spend based or a hybrid approach that uses both.', 'Activity based: Emissions are estimated by collecting primary data and multiplying the value by the relevant emission factors. Examples of primary data include energy or fuel consumed or amount of material purchased.', ""It can also be estimated from secondary data, which is data that is not from specific activities within a company's value chain. Some examples include average data, proxy data or industry average data.(1)"", 'Spend based: Emissions are estimated by determining the amount of money spent on an activity and multiplying the value by the relevant secondary data emission factors. Emissions factors can be from an environmentally-extended input output (EEIO) database, or they can be more supplier specific, based on reported emissions and revenue information. (1)', 'Hybrid: Emissions are estimated by first following the activity-based approach and then using the spend based approach if there are gaps. This increases the coverage of the potential in-scope emissions sources. (1)', 'Improving our data', ""One of the goals of GHG accounting is to use primary data as much as possible, but it's not always easy to access that data. For Scope 1 and 2, primary data is typically available, but in Scope 3, an organization is often reliant on secondary data. This can be a challenge when trying to understand how various investments or design choices are helping to reduce GHG emissions."", 'Cisco has set a goal to reach net zero GHG emissions across our value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2040, and we have also identified two near-term targets on the way to that larger goal. We are continually working to improve our data, provide accurate emissions estimates and drive GHG emission reductions.', ""Information regarding Cisco's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, goals and commitments, our latest impact, as well as policies and additional disclosures for specialized audiences, can be found in our 2022 Cisco Purpose Report and supplemental information in our ESG Reporting Hub."", '1 https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope3_Calculation_Guidance_0.pdf (pg. 14, 17, 21)2 https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Corporate-Value-Chain-Accounting-Reporing-Standard_041613_2.pdf (pg. 33)', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:', 'Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/794148/ciscos-sustainability-101-what-is-carbon-accounting']"
