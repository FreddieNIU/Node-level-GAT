(NASDAQ:VRSK) Now?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-verisk-analytics-inc-131459488.html,1704028499,STORY,['VRSK'],"[""Let's talk about the popular Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$248 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$222. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Verisk Analytics' current trading price of US$239 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Verisk Analytics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' See our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics ', 'The stock is currently trading at US$239 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 35% compared to our intrinsic value of $177.57. This means that the opportunity to buy Verisk Analytics at a good price has disappeared! In addition to this, it seems like Verisk Analytics’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Verisk Analytics' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 47%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? VRSK’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe VRSK should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VRSK for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for VRSK, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you want to dive deeper into Verisk Analytics, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Verisk Analytics you should know about."", 'If you are no longer interested in Verisk Analytics, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Of course, this year marked record runs for mega-sized semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But Nvidia and its kin aren’t the only players in the game. Instead, a range of small-cap semiconductor stocks and companies in semiconductor support roles offer the biggest investment opportunity for 2024.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Small-cap stocks fell from the spotlight amid the larger battle between giants like Nvidia and ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON). But 2024 marks a pivot point that focuses on small-caps, and Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is a crucial link in semiconductor production. Rather than producing chips themselves, Aehr acts as a third-party test solution and thus stands to win no matter which semiconductor mega-stock pulls ahead in the overall race.', 'Aehr’s test systems help companies ensure quality and reliability before sending them to end-users via semiconductor supply chains.

To that end, SWKS’ biggest customer is also one of the world’s biggest cell phone manufacturers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). If Apple bets on SWKS then it’s safe to say the company offers a quality product. Of course, over-reliance on a single customer isn’t ideal, so investors should balance that risk accordingly.', 'But institutional investors aren’t shaken and collectively own an 85% stake. Of those institutional owners, just 19 own more than 50% of the company’s tradable shares, so there’s clearly “smart money” riding on SWKS. Those experts might be betting on the fact that the wide 5G market will grow 32% annually for the rest of the decade, offsetting the Apple risk slightly. Either way, SWKS is an overlooked semiconductor stock with an oversized impact and massive money interests.', 'Source: ToyW / Shutterstock', 'Okay, so Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) isn’t unknown or overlooked among semiconductor stocks. But despite its prominence on industry expert lists of top semiconductor stocks, shares “only” climbed 38% this year. Compare that to Nvidia’s +220% explosion and it’s clear TSM’s pricing isn’t meeting its potential.', 'TSM is unique because it’s a global stock that, in addition to being international itself, also services a wider overseas base than many US-centric semiconductor stocks. For example, Japan is pouring cash into TSM’s coffers to build local plants and help train Japanese researchers and technicians. While this helps TSM from an investment perspective by increasing income opportunities, it also helps diversify its region-specific risk amid ongoing Chinese conflict concerns.', 'And, speaking of financials, TSM’s are hard to beat. The company’s debt is nearly nonexistent and its net margin is sizeable. International stocks tend to suffer more than most amid global economic unease, but TSM’s financial management skills kept them afloat and thriving.

This shift towards sustainability isn’t just good for the planet; it’s aligning with environmental, social, and governance criteria, indicative of the potential for long-term sustainable fashion stocks.', 'Sustainable fashion stocks are emerging as a promising investment avenue, and the innovation in the sphere spans from creative design and manufacturing processes to the use of eco-friendly materials, enhancing consumer engagement. This technological revolution is changing how we produce, consume, and interact with fashion, presenting a compelling long-term case for investors. The journey, though fraught with challenges, presents a dual opportunity for environmental stewardship and financial gain.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'PVH\xa0(NYSE:PVH)\xa0stands as a beacon in sustainable fashion.

This uptick underscores PVH’s adeptness at navigating market volatility. The company’s strategic approach to inventory management also points to a careful balance of profitability and prudence, particularly as it prepares for the fourth quarter.', 'What truly sets PVH apart, however, is its unwavering commitment to sustainability, encapsulated in its “Forward Fashion” strategy.

Moreover, its focus on global mentorship with an emphasis on diversity aligns with its vision for a more sustainable future.', 'Levi Strauss\xa0(NYSE:LEVI) isn’t just a legacy in denim but a luminary in sustainable fashion, making it a compelling long-term choice for ESG-focused investors—the firm’s significant strides in reducing environmental impact place it at the forefront of eco-conscious apparel.

In its most recent financial showing, Levi’s third-quarter earnings slightly surpassed expectations, posting an EPS of 28 cents against a forecasted 27 cents per share, despite sales falling marginally short at $1.51 billion.

The start-up enables cutting-edge research into the world of proteins, which can hold the key to developing advanced healthcare treatments and broadening our understanding of biology at large.', ""Shares shot higher in July when famed tech investor Cathie Wood started buying the stock again. Wood's Ark Genomic Revolution ETF\xa0owns nearly 12% of Quantum-Si as of this writing."", ""Proteomics is still early in commercial development. But it's promising enough that medical instrumentation and services giant Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) is acquiring another proteomics equipment start-up, Olink (NASDAQ: OLK), for $3.1 billion. The offer was announced in October, a few months after Wood's latest Quantum-Si stock purchase, and was a 74% premium to where Olink was trading prior to the deal announcement."", 'Following a precipitous fall after the Cathie Wood hype wore off, Quantum-Si stock has been showing signs of life again in recent months. Quantum-Si\'s affordable semiconductor-based proteomics system certainly seems to hold key technological advantages over anything else commercially available right now. And increasing distribution of its ""Platinum"" benchtop protein sequencing device holds promise.', 'However, at this juncture, and for most retail investors, Olink acquirer Thermo Fisher is a better long-term investment than Quantum-Si.', 'To illustrate the long uphill battle Quantum-Si has ahead of it, look no further than the top-line financials. In Q3 2023, the company logged just $223,000 in sales. Given that each of its benchtop proteomics systems costs roughly $70,000, it only sold a few of them last quarter.', 'And as I wrote over the summer, the backlog of orders looks meager for now too. As of the end of September, the backlog was just approximately $100,000; not much different from where it was at the end of the prior quarter. Perhaps Quantum-Si\'s new distribution agreements will help ramp up potential customer interest, with a ""full commercial launch"" anticipated later in 2024.', 'In the meantime, Quantum-Si continues to burn through cash. Net losses totaled $74 million in the first nine months of 2023, or negative $69 million on an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) basis. Management has stated that the nearly $275 million in cash and short-term investments should keep Quantum-Si\'s development moving forward ""into 2026.""', 'Olink also has limited sales and is losing money too -- both on a GAAP and free-cash-flow basis.', 'However, parent-to-be Thermo Fisher is a highly profitable giant and has deep pockets. Olink will need cash to fuel its future potential in proteomics, and Thermo Fisher can deliver. At some point, unless the sales outlook dramatically changes, Quantum-Si will be in need of some outside cash infusion.', 'For some investors looking for a more speculative but only potentially high-reward stock, Quantum-Si does hold promise. But the research-based ecosystem surrounding proteomics will need to be expanded for a bigger payoff to eventually be realized, and that could take time -- time that Quantum-Si may or may not have, given its tenuous financials at the moment.', 'For investors looking for a more surefire long-term return, Thermo Fisher-plus-Olink checks off some key boxes. The combined business is profitable, Thermo Fisher pays a dividend, and it has a long track record of slower-but-steady returns for shareholders (as measured by total return, which combines stock price appreciation with reinvested dividends).', ""For most retail investors, Quantum-Si should be viewed as little more than a speculative bet. An investment into its stock, if any, should reflect that. Olink's acquirer Thermo Fisher is a better healthcare, life sciences, and proteomics stock investment right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Quantum-Si Incorporated right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Quantum-Si Incorporated, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Quantum-Si Incorporated wasn't one of them.

They've historically outperformed the market over the long term. The best returns have come from companies that routinely increase their dividends."", ""Dividend growers also tend to deliver better returns in flat to slightly higher markets. That could be what's in store in 2024 following the market's massive rally in 2023. Four exceptional dividend stocks are AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ: TROW). They all offer dividends yielding 4% or more (more than double the S&P 500's 1.5% yield) that should continue rising in 2024. "", ""AbbVie's dividend yield is right around 4%. The healthcare company has an excellent track record of growing that payout. It has increased its dividend every year since its inception in 2023, including already unveiling plans to lift it by another 4.7% for 2024. With that increase, AbbVie has boosted its payout by 285% since its formation. "", ""The therapeutics and aesthetics company should be able to continue increasing its dividend in the future. While sales of its blockbuster Humira are declining due to generic competition, it's delivering accelerated growth across the rest of its portfolio. AbbVie is also investing heavily in research & development to continue finding new therapies to drive future growth. Meanwhile, it's using its financial strength to make acquisitions to bolster its growth prospects. It recently agreed to buy ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion and Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion. Those acquisitions will significantly enhance its drug pipeline, setting the stage for future dividend growth. "", 'Brookfield Renewable currently offers a 4.7%-yielding dividend. The renewable energy company has grown its payout by at least 5% annually for the past dozen years. That should continue, with Brookfield targeting 5% to 9% annual dividend growth over the long term. ', 'The company has plenty of power to deliver growth toward the upper end of that range. It currently sees a trio of organic drivers (inflation-linked rate increases, margin expansion, and development projects) fueling 7% to 12% annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share through 2028. ', 'Meanwhile, the company sees M&A activities potentially adding over 9% to its FFO per share each year. Brookfield recently closed three deals and has a couple more in the pipeline. Those acquisitions will add significant incremental FFO, positioning the company to deliver 10%+ FFO per share growth in 2023 and 2024. That sets the stage for it to give its investors another healthy raise in 2024. ', ""Realty Income's dividend currently yields 5.3%. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has a phenomenal record of increasing its payout. It has given investors a raise 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, including five times in the past year. "", ""That growth should continue. Realty Income has already agreed to acquire fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal. That acquisition should increase its adjusted FFO by more than 2.5% per share in 2024. That's over half its growth target of 4% to 5% per year. Meanwhile, after combining with Spirit, Realty Income will generate enough retained cash after paying dividends (about $800 million annually) to fund the acquisitions to push it into that range without raising any equity capital. It should have no shortage of investment opportunities, especially since it has continued to expand its portfolio into new areas, including adding data centers, credit investments, and consumer-centric medical properties over the past year. "", 'T. Rowe Price currently offers a 4.5%-yielding dividend. The mutual fund manager has an exceptional track record of increasing its payout. It raised it by another 1.7% in 2023, its 37th straight year of dividend growth. ', ""While the company's assets under management (AUM) took a hit in 2022 due to the slumping stock market, they resumed their upward trend in 2023. T. Rowe Price ended November at nearly $1.4 trillion (up from less than $1.3 trillion at the end of 2022). AUM should continue climbing as stock and bond prices rise and more investors entrust T. Rowe Price with their money. The company also continues to launch new funds to help investors meet their financial needs, which will also help grow AUM. Rising AUM will help grow the asset manager's fee-related earnings and cash flow, enabling it to continue pushing its payout higher. "", 'AbbVie, Brookfield Renewable, Realty Income, and T. Rowe Price all pay dividends yielding more than 4%. Better yet, those high-yielding payouts should continue rising in the coming year. That sets these stocks up to produce attractive total returns, making them great ones to buy for income and upside in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Brookfield Renewable right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Brookfield Renewable, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Brookfield Renewable wasn't one of them.

The prospects of a looser monetary policy in the next year have served to propel major indexes of the market to swing upwards in recent months. The S&P 500 is up more than 24%, the NASDAQ Composite is up over 44%, while the Dow Jones has registered gains of around 14%. Double digits growth for all three indexes in 2023 is a remarkable turnaround from 2022.\xa0', 'Some of the major reasons for this include slowing inflation, steady consumer spending, a resilient labor market, and expert predictions about a soft landing for the economy. All three benchmark indexes of the market have posted nine consecutive weeks of gains at the end of the year, with the tech-heavy NASDAQ shining bright. Despite layoffs in the tech sector, this is the best performance for the growth index since 2020.\xa0', 'Big tech firms that dominate the NASDAQ, like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), have performed exceptionally well this year. The stocks of these firms are up 57%, 245%, and 54% this year. As the momentum shifts towards growth, the Treasury Yields are falling. After reaching a record near 5% over the past few months, the 10-year bond yield has ended 2023 at 4% and is expected to fall further in the new year.\xa0', 'However, investors should be wary of geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, US tension with China, and the performance of the US dollar index as the head into 2024. The worst may already be over though, and investors can take heart from this and invest in money making companies that have an established history of excellence. One of these firms, as mentioned above, is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the U.S. with award-winning customer satisfaction. And this spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling. Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty."", ""In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami.

This large and well-controlled trial helps to demonstrate that the weight loss benefits of GLP-1s (likely similar for Mounjaro and Wegovy) lead to better health outcomes for patients and likely save the healthcare system significant amounts of money over the long term. In our view, this makes it very unlikely that payors and governments will deny patient access and reimbursement for these drugs for the long haul (hence the positive stock price moves for Lilly and Novo when the data was released mid-quarter).', 'We have started with a small 1% position in Lilly, but when paired with our new holding in Novo Nordisk at 2% (NVO is slightly larger as its valuation is lower), it represents a 3% combined position in the two companies we expect to maintain a duopoly in this large drug class over the next several years.', 'Novo Nordisk has a long history as the leader in diabetes pharmaceuticals. It is much more narrowly focused on diabetes than Lilly with its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy (Wegovy is the same drug as Ozempic but uses a different name for obesity), driving most of the company’s revenue and earnings growth. The cardiovascular outcomes trial mentioned above is a big positive for Novo. It establishes the duopoly with Lilly in insulin management for Type 2 diabetics and weight loss for the huge number of overweight and obese people across the globe.', 'Novo has more legacy diabetes products that its newer drugs will cannibalize, but our research indicates that we can expect high-teens earnings per share growth from Novo over the next five years.

The iconic stock market benchmark rallied roughly 14% (recovering from a nearly 11% slide in 2022). ', 'However, not all Dow Jones stocks were in rally mode in 2023. Several lagged the index last year, led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Those declines pushed the dividend yields of those ""Dogs of the Dow"" higher. Here\'s why dividend investors will want to scoop up shares in 2024.', ""Shares of Walgreens slumped nearly 29% in 2023, the biggest drop among Dow stocks. That sell-off pushed the healthcare, pharmacy, and retail company's dividend yield up to 7.2%. The company has an excellent track record of paying dividends. It has paid them for 364 straight quarters (91 years) while growing its payout for the last 47 consecutive years. "", 'While dividend growth has been anemic in recent years (Walgreens only gave investors a 0.5% raise in 2023), it could reaccelerate in the future. The company is in the midst of a major transformation as it aligns its core business, builds its next growth engine with consumer-centric healthcare solutions, and optimizes its portfolio. It has been selling several noncore assets, including its sizable stake in Cencora, to invest in building out its growth engine. The company has also floated the idea of launching an IPO of its U.K.-based pharmacy chain Boots. ', ""These actions have weighed on its earnings growth and balance sheet. However, along with transformational cost cuts, these moves should eventually reinvigorate the company's growth rate. That growing cash flow will give Walgreens more money to invest in growing its core businesses, repaying debt, and paying dividends. It would also help lift some of the weight on its stock price. "", ""Chevron's stock price slumped about 15% in 2023, the second-worst performance in the Dow. Lower oil prices were the primary catalyst driving the sell-off. "", ""There's not much Chevron can do about oil prices. However, what it can do is reduce costs and increase its ability to generate more cash at lower oil prices. That's what it has been doing over the past year. The company has been growing its scale by acquiring oil companies to reduce costs and boost its cash flow and growth potential."", 'Chevron bought PDC Energy in 2023 for $7.6 billion. The company expects to capture over $100 million in cost savings. That helps drive its view that the deal will boost its free cash flow by over $1 billion (assuming oil averages $70 a barrel, which is right around the recent price). ', 'Meanwhile, Chevron signed an even bigger deal in October, agreeing to buy Hess for nearly $60 billion. The company expects to capture $1 billion in annual cost savings from the acquisition. It also anticipates that the transaction will enhance its free cash flow growth profile while extending its outlook into the 2030s. ', ""That improved free cash flow growth drives Chevron's view that it will increase its 4%-yielding dividend by another 8% in 2024. That would be its 37th straight year of dividend growth. "", 'Johnson & Johnson declined by about 11% in 2023, the third-worst performance in the Dow. That slump pushed its dividend yield up to 3%. The company increased its payout by 5.3% in 2023, its 61st straight year of dividend growth. ', 'One of the factors that weighed on the stock was the overhang from the separation of its former consumer healthcare business, Kenvue. Johnson & Johnson completed an IPO of that business and then spun off most of the remaining shares to its investors. It holds a minority stake that it eventually expects to monetize.', ""The healthcare behemoth's sales and cash flow declined following the spinoff. However, the company expects growth to reaccelerate in 2024 as it focuses on its faster-growing pharmaceutical and MedTech divisions. It sees its operational sales growing by 5% to 6% next year, with adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 7.3% at the midpoint. Meanwhile, the company forecasts 5%-7% operational sales growth and similar earnings-per-share growth in the 2025-2030 time frame, with free cash flow improving back to its pre-Kenvue level by 2026. "", ""Acquisitions could drive even faster growth in the coming years. Johnson & Johnson has one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. It has AAA-rated credit and ended the third quarter with $24 billion in cash against $30 billion of debt. It also owns 9.5% of Kenvue's stock, worth around $4 billion. "", 'That gives it tremendous financial flexibility to make deals. It most recently agreed to pay $400 million to buy Laminar to bolster its MedTech offerings. ', 'Walgreens, Chevron, and Johnson & Johnson were the worst-performing Dow Jones stocks of 2023. Those slumping stock prices helped push up their dividend yields. That makes them look like attractive income stocks to buy in 2024. ', 'In addition to that income, they offer meaningful upside potential when their share prices eventually bounce back. Because of that, they could produce strong total returns in 2024, making them great Dow stocks to buy right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

And they are devoted to maximizing shareholder value, via the return of excess capital.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'So, with a few dozen dividend kings out there, only a few stand out as strong opportunities heading into 2024.', 'The following seven dividend kings offer not only steady returns from their consistent, growing payouts, but also solid appreciation potential.', 'On top of being poised to deliver strong total returns thanks to dividend and earnings growth, these kings also stand to benefit from the improving macro outlook (cooling inflation, the prospect of lower interest rates). Let’s explore them.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'Founded in 1962, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the oldest REITs. Therefore, it makes sense that FRT holds dividend king status. REITs pay the lion’s share of their earnings out as distributions, and typically, REITs (at least, successful REITs) experience steady earnings growth.', 'FRT stock has raised its dividend 56 years in a row. At current prices, shares sport a forward yield of around 4.22%. FRT’s payouts have grown by just 1.5% annually on average over the past five years.

Also, over the past five years, they have grown by an average of 6.63% annually.', 'This relatively high dividend growth rate is but one reason PEP stock may be a better king to buy and hold than KO stock. Despite a longer dividend growth track record (61 years), KO’s payouts have only increased by an average of 3.36% annually. That’s not all. As a Zacks commentator pointed out back in October, PEP has outperformed KO over the past 25 years.', 'This outperformance could continue, given PEP’s higher expected earnings growth rate in 2024 (7.94%) versus its “Cola wars” rival (4.48%). Hence, both stocks could also experience multiple expansion thanks to lower interest rates.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'RPM International (NYSE:RPM) has received some increased attention lately, thanks to a recent profile in Barron’s. As detailed in the article, this manufacturer of coatings and building materials has just earned “dividend king” status this year.', 'However, that may not necessarily be the main appeal with RPM stock. RPM’s payout is relatively modest (1.65%), even if it has increased by around 12.4% annually over the past five years. What is really appealing is the prospect of continued earnings growth.', 'Through both the execution of a successful “bolt-on” acquisition strategy, plus the implementation of a company-wide program to maximize operating performance, not to mention the potential impact of cooling inflation and lower interest rates on demand for its various products, RPM appears poised to prosper in the coming year. With this, consider it one of the dividend stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.com', 'Among the dividend kings, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) is admittedly a bit pricey. Shares in the credit rating and benchmark index provider currently trade for around 34.4 times forward earnings. Yet while SPGI is by no means a value stock, dividend and growth investors alike may want to consider it.', 'SPGI stock has a relatively low dividend yield (0.83%), but payouts have grown 50 years in a row. Over the past five years, payouts have increased nearly 12.5% annually on average. Forecasts call for earnings growth next year of around 14.4%.', 'An improving macro environment, plus the company’s earnings beat/guidance raise last quarter, points to S&P Global meeting, if not also beating, these forecasts. If this happens, not only could it help sustain SPGI’s stock price and propel it higher. Such an earnings increase points to similarly-sized dividend increases in the future.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'Food product and kitchen equipment wholesaler Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock well-known for its dividend king status. Sysco has increased its dividend payout 55 years in a row.', 'SYY currently has a forward yield of 2.72%. Payout growth for Sysco over the past five years has averaged 6.58% annually. Although SYY has bounced back strongly in recent weeks, shares may not be at risk of topping out anytime soon. Gradual gains could continue into 2024.', 'Why? As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, the company continues to grow/enhance its business, through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions.

Let’s explore them.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'Founded in 1962, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the oldest REITs.

At current prices, shares sport a forward yield of around 4.22%. FRT’s payouts have grown by just 1.5% annually on average over the past five years.

RPM’s payout is relatively modest (1.65%), even if it has increased by around 12.4% annually over the past five years. What is really appealing is the prospect of continued earnings growth.', 'Through both the execution of a successful “bolt-on” acquisition strategy, plus the implementation of a company-wide program to maximize operating performance, not to mention the potential impact of cooling inflation and lower interest rates on demand for its various products, RPM appears poised to prosper in the coming year.

We have been monitoring Lilly and Novo Nordisk for some time, and new clinical results from a recent drug trial give us confidence in the large upside potential for GLP-1s.

This large and well-controlled trial helps to demonstrate that the weight loss benefits of GLP-1s (likely similar for Mounjaro and Wegovy) lead to better health outcomes for patients and likely save the healthcare system significant amounts of money over the long term. In our view, this makes it very unlikely that payors and governments will deny patient access and reimbursement for these drugs for the long haul (hence the positive stock price moves for Lilly and Novo when the data was released mid-quarter).', 'We have started with a small 1% position in Lilly, but when paired with our new holding in Novo Nordisk at 2% (NVO is slightly larger as its valuation is lower), it represents a 3% combined position in the two companies we expect to maintain a duopoly in this large drug class over the next several years.', 'Novo Nordisk has a long history as the leader in diabetes pharmaceuticals. It is much more narrowly focused on diabetes than Lilly with its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy (Wegovy is the same drug as Ozempic but uses a different name for obesity), driving most of the company’s revenue and earnings growth. The cardiovascular outcomes trial mentioned above is a big positive for Novo. It establishes the duopoly with Lilly in insulin management for Type 2 diabetics and weight loss for the huge number of overweight and obese people across the globe.', 'Novo has more legacy diabetes products that its newer drugs will cannibalize, but our research indicates that we can expect high-teens earnings per share growth from Novo over the next five years.

The iconic stock market benchmark rallied roughly 14% (recovering from a nearly 11% slide in 2022). ', 'However, not all Dow Jones stocks were in rally mode in 2023. Several lagged the index last year, led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Those declines pushed the dividend yields of those ""Dogs of the Dow"" higher. Here\'s why dividend investors will want to scoop up shares in 2024.', ""Shares of Walgreens slumped nearly 29% in 2023, the biggest drop among Dow stocks. That sell-off pushed the healthcare, pharmacy, and retail company's dividend yield up to 7.2%. The company has an excellent track record of paying dividends. It has paid them for 364 straight quarters (91 years) while growing its payout for the last 47 consecutive years. "", 'While dividend growth has been anemic in recent years (Walgreens only gave investors a 0.5% raise in 2023), it could reaccelerate in the future. The company is in the midst of a major transformation as it aligns its core business, builds its next growth engine with consumer-centric healthcare solutions, and optimizes its portfolio. It has been selling several noncore assets, including its sizable stake in Cencora, to invest in building out its growth engine. The company has also floated the idea of launching an IPO of its U.K.-based pharmacy chain Boots. ', ""These actions have weighed on its earnings growth and balance sheet. However, along with transformational cost cuts, these moves should eventually reinvigorate the company's growth rate. That growing cash flow will give Walgreens more money to invest in growing its core businesses, repaying debt, and paying dividends. It would also help lift some of the weight on its stock price. "", ""Chevron's stock price slumped about 15% in 2023, the second-worst performance in the Dow. Lower oil prices were the primary catalyst driving the sell-off. "", ""There's not much Chevron can do about oil prices. However, what it can do is reduce costs and increase its ability to generate more cash at lower oil prices. That's what it has been doing over the past year. The company has been growing its scale by acquiring oil companies to reduce costs and boost its cash flow and growth potential."", 'Chevron bought PDC Energy in 2023 for $7.6 billion. The company expects to capture over $100 million in cost savings. That helps drive its view that the deal will boost its free cash flow by over $1 billion (assuming oil averages $70 a barrel, which is right around the recent price). ', 'Meanwhile, Chevron signed an even bigger deal in October, agreeing to buy Hess for nearly $60 billion. The company expects to capture $1 billion in annual cost savings from the acquisition. It also anticipates that the transaction will enhance its free cash flow growth profile while extending its outlook into the 2030s. ', ""That improved free cash flow growth drives Chevron's view that it will increase its 4%-yielding dividend by another 8% in 2024. That would be its 37th straight year of dividend growth. "", 'Johnson & Johnson declined by about 11% in 2023, the third-worst performance in the Dow. That slump pushed its dividend yield up to 3%. The company increased its payout by 5.3% in 2023, its 61st straight year of dividend growth. ', 'One of the factors that weighed on the stock was the overhang from the separation of its former consumer healthcare business, Kenvue. Johnson & Johnson completed an IPO of that business and then spun off most of the remaining shares to its investors. It holds a minority stake that it eventually expects to monetize.', ""The healthcare behemoth's sales and cash flow declined following the spinoff. However, the company expects growth to reaccelerate in 2024 as it focuses on its faster-growing pharmaceutical and MedTech divisions. It sees its operational sales growing by 5% to 6% next year, with adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 7.3% at the midpoint. Meanwhile, the company forecasts 5%-7% operational sales growth and similar earnings-per-share growth in the 2025-2030 time frame, with free cash flow improving back to its pre-Kenvue level by 2026. "", ""Acquisitions could drive even faster growth in the coming years. Johnson & Johnson has one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. It has AAA-rated credit and ended the third quarter with $24 billion in cash against $30 billion of debt. It also owns 9.5% of Kenvue's stock, worth around $4 billion. "", 'That gives it tremendous financial flexibility to make deals. It most recently agreed to pay $400 million to buy Laminar to bolster its MedTech offerings. ', 'Walgreens, Chevron, and Johnson & Johnson were the worst-performing Dow Jones stocks of 2023. Those slumping stock prices helped push up their dividend yields. That makes them look like attractive income stocks to buy in 2024. ', 'In addition to that income, they offer meaningful upside potential when their share prices eventually bounce back. Because of that, they could produce strong total returns in 2024, making them great Dow stocks to buy right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

', ""Today, the average dividend yield for an S&P 500 stock is just under 1.5%. At that rate, to collect at least $1,000 in annual dividends, you would need to invest more than $67,000. That's not something most investors would likely have available to invest right now."", ""One stock that offers a much higher dividend yield is Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). At 3.4%, its yield is more than double what the S&P 500 offers. And the company has also increased its dividend payment for 46 straight years. But the medical device specialist's financials haven't been great in recent years, and there are concerns that the payout may be too high. "", ""Does Medtronic make for a good income investment, or is the stock's dividend in danger of a cut?"", ""For dividend investors, a key metric that often gets a lot of focus is a stock's payout ratio. This tells investors how much of earnings a company is paying out in the form of dividends. If a business is paying out more than what it generates in profits, that would mean its payout ratio is more than 100%. Investors often get worried when a payout ratio is over 80%; Medtronic's is currently at around 90%."", ""The good news, however, is that this isn't exactly unchartered territory for Medtronic. Over the past few years, there has been some volatility in the company's earnings as the pandemic and supply chain issues disrupted operations for the healthcare industry."", ""Another number investors should also look to when evaluating a dividend's overall safety is free cash flow. This is how much a company generates in cash from its operating activities after deducting capital expenditures. Over the trailing 12 months, Medtronic's free cash has totaled just over $4 billion. While that's positive, it doesn't offer a huge buffer over the $3.6 billion that the medical device company has paid out in dividends over that same period."", 'The following chart shows the delta between free cash flow and dividend payments. Last quarter, which ended on Oct. 27, there was a shortfall of nearly $720 million.', 'Cash flow can be volatile, and the encouraging takeaway for investors is that over the past five years, Medtronic has, on average, generated a buffer of around $475 million per quarter.', ""Medtronic's dividend remains sustainable, but there's definitely some risk, particularly as the company continues to reinvest in its growth because that could put a strain on cash. But with supply chain problems abating and the overall conditions in the healthcare industry improving, Medtronic should be on a better path now."", ""Investors should monitor the company closely, however, to ensure that its financials are strengthening. While Medtronic's payout ratio is high, unless it stays high for long and the cash situation doesn't improve, I wouldn't expect the company to take the drastic measure of cutting its dividend or stopping its dividend growth streak.

One research firm claims that 2024 will kickstart a prolonged 20% CAGR trend next year, with artificial intelligence and vehicle-centric utility leading the way. Of course, this year marked record runs for mega-sized semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But Nvidia and its kin aren’t the only players in the game. Instead, a range of small-cap semiconductor stocks and companies in semiconductor support roles offer the biggest investment opportunity for 2024.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Small-cap stocks fell from the spotlight amid the larger battle between giants like Nvidia and ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON). But 2024 marks a pivot point that focuses on small-caps, and Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is a crucial link in semiconductor production. Rather than producing chips themselves, Aehr acts as a third-party test solution and thus stands to win no matter which semiconductor mega-stock pulls ahead in the overall race.', 'Aehr’s test systems help companies ensure quality and reliability before sending them to end-users via semiconductor supply chains. Aehr contributes its services to Samsung, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and more. At the same time, its scope spans chip testing across 5G infrastructure, self-driving cars, data center expansion and similar next-gen semiconductor stock trends.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be fair, Aehr is on a record run and gained nearly 2,000% over the past five years. But its 1-year performance, while great, pales compared to the mega-caps it supports. As semiconductors increasingly insert themselves into daily life, sensitive test solutions will become more important, making Aehr one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a niche semiconductor stock that primarily services wireless devices to help users connect with cell towers and other transmitters. To that end, SWKS’ biggest customer is also one of the world’s biggest cell phone manufacturers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). If Apple bets on SWKS then it’s safe to say the company offers a quality product. Of course, over-reliance on a single customer isn’t ideal, so investors should balance that risk accordingly.', 'But institutional investors aren’t shaken and collectively own an 85% stake. Of those institutional owners, just 19 own more than 50% of the company’s tradable shares, so there’s clearly “smart money” riding on SWKS. Those experts might be betting on the fact that the wide 5G market will grow 32% annually for the rest of the decade, offsetting the Apple risk slightly. Either way, SWKS is an overlooked semiconductor stock with an oversized impact and massive money interests.', 'Source: ToyW / Shutterstock', 'Okay, so Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) isn’t unknown or overlooked among semiconductor stocks. But despite its prominence on industry expert lists of top semiconductor stocks, shares “only” climbed 38% this year. Compare that to Nvidia’s +220% explosion and it’s clear TSM’s pricing isn’t meeting its potential.', 'TSM is unique because it’s a global stock that, in addition to being international itself, also services a wider overseas base than many US-centric semiconductor stocks. For example, Japan is pouring cash into TSM’s coffers to build local plants and help train Japanese researchers and technicians. While this helps TSM from an investment perspective by increasing income opportunities, it also helps diversify its region-specific risk amid ongoing Chinese conflict concerns.', 'And, speaking of financials, TSM’s are hard to beat. The company’s debt is nearly nonexistent and its net margin is sizeable. International stocks tend to suffer more than most amid global economic unease, but TSM’s financial management skills kept them afloat and thriving.

Investors want a repeat of this type of performance."", ""Better days might be on the horizon. As we set our sights on the future, here's why 2024 could be this fintech stock's\xa0best year ever."", 'The first thing that could help PayPal shares in 2024 is the new chief executive officer, Alex Chriss. He took over from longtime CEO Dan Schulman. A new face could bring a fresh perspective to the business, something investors should be optimistic about.', 'Chriss has already hinted at his plans for PayPal. ""We will become leaner, more efficient, and more effective, driving greater velocity, innovation, and impact for customers,"" he said on the Q3 2023 earnings call.', ""Many other companies, primarily those in tech-focused industries that benefited greatly from huge pandemic-driven growth, are following a similar strategy of right-sizing operations. In PayPal's case, the hope is that a more controlled cost structure can lead to better profitability."", ""That's not to say this isn't already a successful business from a financial perspective. PayPal is forecast to generate $4.6 billion in free cash flow in 2023. And it has $4.8 billion\xa0of net cash on the balance sheet."", ""Moreover, the company benefits from network effects thanks to its two-sided platform, serving consumers and merchants. And it's riding the secular tailwind of digital payments and online shopping."", ""These positive traits should make Chriss's job a bit easier. For what it's worth, he can continue Schulman's goal of finding ways to increase engagement from the existing user base, as opposed to spending on marketing initiatives to bring on new customers who likely won't use the service much."", ""Consequently, Chriss can prove he isn't ignoring the qualities that established the company as a leading payments platform. In 2024, it should be about relentlessly focusing the strategy and capital investments on areas of the business that already work, as opposed to pursuing initiatives that aren't core to the mission."", ""Throughout the majority of its history as an independent business, PayPal benefited tremendously from loose monetary policy. This is clearly evident when looking at the company's growth between 2015 and 2021, for example. And it helps explain why the stock skyrocketed during that time."", ""So, it's no surprise that when inflation proved not to be transitory and the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive path to hike interest rates, PayPal's business was hurt. The payments platform leans toward discretionary purchases. When consumers are directing their spending toward essential items, which is what it seems they've been doing in the last couple of years, there's less money left over to go toward less important things."", 'Next year could reverse these trends. With inflation coming down in the past several months, the central bank could start to cut rates in 2024. And this could provide a huge boost to the economy, mainly by supporting stronger consumer confidence.', 'For PayPal, the necessary backdrop would be in place to see accelerated growth in payments volume and revenue. Investors would certainly cheer this outcome, supporting outsize share-price gains.', ""As of this writing, PayPal shares are ridiculously cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.1. In the past three years, this metric has averaged a whopping 30.9. It's accurate to say there's a ton of pessimism surrounding this business."", 'Investors should prioritize stocks with attractive valuations.

So it's high time to set your portfolio up for the new year, and you don't have to do it alone."", 'Three Motley Fool contributors put their heads together to present their best AI investments for the new year.', ""In the resulting discussion, you'll find three standout AI stocks with market-beating prospects in 2024 and beyond. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) made a strategic pivot toward AI and cloud computing. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a trailblazer in specialized hardware and generative AI systems. ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) forms the backbone of AI chip manufacturing."", 'These companies not only represent the pinnacle of innovation in AI but also offer unique investment opportunities.', 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Nvidia): It may sound like a ""too-easy"" pick, or even one that\'s overhyped, but after Nvidia\'s last earnings update, there could be plenty of room for the generative AI system pioneer to climb higher during the new year. How so?', 'During the third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call (for the period ended in October 2023), revenue soared 206% higher than the year prior to $18.1 billion, driven by the data center segment (where most of the generative AI chip and system sales are registered). Astoundingly, another sequential increase is expected in the fourth quarter with management predicting $20 billion in sales.', ""But here's where things get interesting and where the debate comes in (as Anders, Billy, and I wrote about a couple of months ago): CEO Jensen Huang and the top team have been clear that they expect their data center sales (80% of total revenue last quarter) to continue rising in calendar year 2024 as more supply of its AI chips comes to market to meet insatiable demand. The market seems to have wrapped its head around this, with Wall Street analysts' consensus for next year's revenue pegged at nearly $91 billion, which implies a more than 50% increase."", 'But semiconductor sales tend to be cyclical. Periods of surging revenue are often followed by a slump. All eyes are now on what will happen in 2025. But for the record, on the last earnings call, Huang said he ""absolutely believe[s] that data center can grow through 2025.""', 'The jury is, of course, still out on this. At some point, I expect the world to take a breather on building new AI computing infrastructure. Perhaps that will finally arrive in 2025, or maybe it will delay until 2026 or later.', ""But if Huang is correct, and that the roughly $1 trillion global AI data-center opportunity continues to expand unabated over the next couple of years, Nvidia looks like a reasonably valued semiconductor stock. Shares trade for 25 times next year's (calendar year 2024) expected earnings per share. I have no plan on selling any of my position in Nvidia just yet as another busy year gets rolling."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): The IBM you see today is miles apart from the one-stop-IT-shop from the turn of the millennium. In a prescient yet painful strategy shift that started in 2012 and never really ended, Big Blue refocused its massive assets on the high-growth ""strategic imperatives"" of cloud computing, data security, analytics, and AI.', ""The watsonx.ai platform is a development platform custom-built for enterprise-scale businesses in search of machine learning and generative AI tools. It includes generative AI support in the app-writing experience and the option to generate apps in a drag-and-drop graphical interface rather than manual coding, and it relies on IBM's many decades of AI research."", ""And the company isn't resting on its digital laurels. The company has $11 billion of cash equivalents and generated $10.3 billion of free cash flow\xa0over the last four quarters. And those funds are aimed squarely at the AI opportunity right now."", 'For instance, IBM recently committed to training 2 million AI experts in the next three years, collaborating with universities around the world. It also started a $500 million investment fund focused on innovative AI start-ups.', ""As a result, IBM is poised to make up for its strategy-shifting pain with robust gains in the years to come. Trading at just 2.4 times trailing sales and 12.3 times free cash flow, IBM's stock looks like a no-brainer buy today."", ""Yet, market makers seem to have forgotten about the giant shadow IBM casts over the AI opportunity. The stock has only gained 16% in 2023, falling behind the S&P 500 index's 25% increase."", ""I don't mean to throw market-beating performers like Nvidia under the bus, and I own that stock myself. However, the chip designer's shares are changing hands at 27 times sales or 70 times free cash flow. If you're looking for a strong AI investment at the threshold of 2024, IBM combines fantastic growth prospects and an unbeatable AI history with bargain-bin share prices."", 'Billy Duberstein (ASML Holdings): A lot of artificial intelligence stocks have gone up a lot this year, so there aren\'t that many bargains left. However, ASML Holdings, at least by comparison, underperformed a lot of AI stocks, rising ""only"" 38% despite its machines being essential to the AI chipmaking process. In addition, the stock remains about 15% below its all-time high set back in late 2021, whereas many other semiconductor and AI stocks are now above those prior highs.', 'ASML data by YCharts.', 'There are several reasons for this year\'s underperformance. First, ASML is a European stock, so the relative performance of each market may have some effect. Second, ASML traded at a relatively higher valuation than other semiconductor-equipment companies coming into the year. So, there wasn\'t as much ground to ""make up"" after the 2022 sector plunge. Even now, ASML trades at 35 times earnings.', ""In addition, ASML management already said the company won't see much growth in 2024. This may be surprising, since most other semiconductor companies had a weak 2023 and now project a recovery year in 2024. However, ASML's growth has been a little different. During the pandemic, ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines were in such high demand and are so complicated and expensive to build that the production bottleneck stretched into this year. So, whereas many other semiconductor-equipment companies saw revenues decline in 2023, ASML will actually see 2023 revenue growth of about 30%. Only next year in 2024 will it endure the post-pandemic downturn effect."", ""However, as chip stocks tend to look ahead about a year, ASML could outperform some of its peers going into 2025. That's a year management has predicted will be a big growth year, as several new leading-edge fabs come online using ASML's latest EUV machines. In fact, ASML just shipped the first parts of its first high-numerical aperture (NA) EUV machine, the latest and most advanced model of EUV, to Intel. The high-NA machine is absolutely massive and will have to be shipped in 250 separate crates! Even though the first batch is being shipped now, production with them probably won't happen until late 2025."", ""While ASML stock isn't cheap, it has a monopoly on EUV technology needed to make chips below 7nm, which the industry just surpassed a couple of years ago. Last year's leading-edge chips, such as the Nvidia H100, were manufactured on the 5nm node, and 2023 saw the production of the first 3nm chips."", ""But the first 2nm chips will be made in 2025, which is the node in which both Samsung and Intel hope to catch up to foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in leading-edge logic chips. That intense competition for the 2nm node means all of these companies will be buying lots of ASML's machines to make those dreams a reality."", ""And the story doesn't end there, as all major dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturers will also begin using EUV to make DRAM chips going forward. While Samsung began using EUV two years ago, 2025 will also see Micron\xa0begin to use EUV for the first time in its memory production\xa0as the last memory holdout to use the complex process."", 'Generative AI will depend heavily on leading-edge processors and high-bandwidth memory, so look for ASML to perhaps outperform its peers in 2024 after lagging in 2023.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

And they are devoted to maximizing shareholder value, via the return of excess capital.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'So, with a few dozen dividend kings out there, only a few stand out as strong opportunities heading into 2024.', 'The following seven dividend kings offer not only steady returns from their consistent, growing payouts, but also solid appreciation potential.', 'On top of being poised to deliver strong total returns thanks to dividend and earnings growth, these kings also stand to benefit from the improving macro outlook (cooling inflation, the prospect of lower interest rates). Let’s explore them.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'Founded in 1962, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the oldest REITs. Therefore, it makes sense that FRT holds dividend king status. REITs pay the lion’s share of their earnings out as distributions, and typically, REITs (at least, successful REITs) experience steady earnings growth.', 'FRT stock has raised its dividend 56 years in a row. At current prices, shares sport a forward yield of around 4.22%. FRT’s payouts have grown by just 1.5% annually on average over the past five years. And forecasts call for its funds from operations (or FFO, the REIT equivalent to earnings) to grow just 2.9% next year.', 'So then, what makes this royal REIT a buy?

REITs (which are highly sensitive to interest rate changes) could receive a boost FRT is no exception.', 'Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com', 'Soft drink and snack foods giant Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) is, like its rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), one of the dividend kings. PEP has raised its payout 51 years in a row. Also, over the past five years, they have grown by an average of 6.63% annually.', 'This relatively high dividend growth rate is but one reason PEP stock may be a better king to buy and hold than KO stock. Despite a longer dividend growth track record (61 years), KO’s payouts have only increased by an average of 3.36% annually. That’s not all. As a Zacks commentator pointed out back in October, PEP has outperformed KO over the past 25 years.', 'This outperformance could continue, given PEP’s higher expected earnings growth rate in 2024 (7.94%) versus its “Cola wars” rival (4.48%). Hence, both stocks could also experience multiple expansion thanks to lower interest rates.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'RPM International (NYSE:RPM) has received some increased attention lately, thanks to a recent profile in Barron’s. As detailed in the article, this manufacturer of coatings and building materials has just earned “dividend king” status this year.', 'However, that may not necessarily be the main appeal with RPM stock. RPM’s payout is relatively modest (1.65%), even if it has increased by around 12.4% annually over the past five years. What is really appealing is the prospect of continued earnings growth.', 'Through both the execution of a successful “bolt-on” acquisition strategy, plus the implementation of a company-wide program to maximize operating performance, not to mention the potential impact of cooling inflation and lower interest rates on demand for its various products, RPM appears poised to prosper in the coming year. With this, consider it one of the dividend stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.com', 'Among the dividend kings, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) is admittedly a bit pricey. Shares in the credit rating and benchmark index provider currently trade for around 34.4 times forward earnings. Yet while SPGI is by no means a value stock, dividend and growth investors alike may want to consider it.', 'SPGI stock has a relatively low dividend yield (0.83%), but payouts have grown 50 years in a row. Over the past five years, payouts have increased nearly 12.5% annually on average. Forecasts call for earnings growth next year of around 14.4%.', 'An improving macro environment, plus the company’s earnings beat/guidance raise last quarter, points to S&P Global meeting, if not also beating, these forecasts. If this happens, not only could it help sustain SPGI’s stock price and propel it higher. Such an earnings increase points to similarly-sized dividend increases in the future.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'Food product and kitchen equipment wholesaler Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock well-known for its dividend king status. Sysco has increased its dividend payout 55 years in a row.', 'SYY currently has a forward yield of 2.72%. Payout growth for Sysco over the past five years has averaged 6.58% annually. Although SYY has bounced back strongly in recent weeks, shares may not be at risk of topping out anytime soon. Gradual gains could continue into 2024.', 'Why? As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, the company continues to grow/enhance its business, through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Also, Sysco is strong in the share repurchase department, committing $750 million to buybacks this fiscal year (ending June 2024). These factors, plus easing inflation, may mean additional improvements in sentiment for SYY over the next twelve months.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Target (NYSE:TGT) is a dividend king, with 55 years of consecutive annual dividend growth. Currently, shares in the big box retailing giant have a forward dividend yield of 3.16%. Payouts have increased by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.', 'With this, investors looking for a dividend growth stock with a moderate-sized yield may want to consider TGT stock.

Both are omnipresent and, in their own ways, on the cutting edge of global innovation that cement their longevity as investable opportunities. But combine the two into healthcare technology stocks, and you’re looking at massive upside potential.', 'Of course, snagging industry-wide trends is best done through ETF investing. For HealthTech exposure, it’s hard to beat a well-rounded healthcare ETF like the iShares Global Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA:IXJ) combined with a speculative biotech ETF like the iShares Genomics, Immunology, and Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA:IDNA). But playing stock jockey is more fun, and, in both cases, high expense fees eat into your overall gains.', 'If you want to snag the best-in-class healthcare technology stocks for 2024 rather than playing it safe with wide-ranging HealthTech ETFs, it’s hard to beat these three top stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'Crispr Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) made waves earlier this month as its sickle cell treatment, Casgevy, became the first gene-editing therapy approved by the FDA.

But, though the implications are staggering, CRSP shares dropped nearly 15% since the announcement.', 'Investors’ lack of enthusiasm is primarily due to Casgevy’s short-term operational and financial implications rather than what the approval stands for conceptually. Casgevy’s price tag, more than $2 million, is steep. At the same time, the total US addressable market stands at just 100,000 afflicted with sickle cell. Though the treatment will be life-changing to those receiving it, the high cost and limited marketability mean drug sales won’t come close to matching the high R&D costs it took to get Crispr to this point.', 'But if you’re investing for the long haul, finding tomorrow’s revolutionary healthcare technology stocks is as simple as loading up on CRSP.

TDOC, in particular, trades more than 90% below past highs. But that fall from grace isn’t an indictment of Teladoc’s model or viability. And, while it may not reach past highs anytime soon, investing in Teladoc today is a way to capture an expanding segment of healthcare technology stocks.', 'Telehealth proved viable during the pandemic, and remote physician care is here to stay. Today, more than 20% of adult patients use telehealth as an alternative to in-person visits. What’s more, usage trends accelerate with aging, as 43% of patients 65 or older use remote medicine services compared to just 29% within the 18 – 29 range. The national population is aging rapidly, which, if trends hold, means telemedicine will keep pace and become more prevalent.', 'Teladoc’s market share has lots of room to improve. But there’s an important consideration when looking at rankings. Teladoc is edged out by Zoom and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). But those are just generalist platforms, and within telemedicine-focused remote platforms, Teladoc is neck-and-neck with direct competitors Amwell (NYSE:AMWL) and Doxy.me. But systems will become increasingly niche, not more generalized, and it only takes one data leak or HIPAA lawsuit to shut down Zoom and other broad-spectrum platforms’ forays into healthcare.

So it's high time to set your portfolio up for the new year, and you don't have to do it alone."", 'Three Motley Fool contributors put their heads together to present their best AI investments for the new year.', ""In the resulting discussion, you'll find three standout AI stocks with market-beating prospects in 2024 and beyond. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) made a strategic pivot toward AI and cloud computing. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a trailblazer in specialized hardware and generative AI systems. ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) forms the backbone of AI chip manufacturing."", 'These companies not only represent the pinnacle of innovation in AI but also offer unique investment opportunities.', 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Nvidia): It may sound like a ""too-easy"" pick, or even one that\'s overhyped, but after Nvidia\'s last earnings update, there could be plenty of room for the generative AI system pioneer to climb higher during the new year. How so?', 'During the third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call (for the period ended in October 2023), revenue soared 206% higher than the year prior to $18.1 billion, driven by the data center segment (where most of the generative AI chip and system sales are registered). Astoundingly, another sequential increase is expected in the fourth quarter with management predicting $20 billion in sales.', ""But here's where things get interesting and where the debate comes in (as Anders, Billy, and I wrote about a couple of months ago): CEO Jensen Huang and the top team have been clear that they expect their data center sales (80% of total revenue last quarter) to continue rising in calendar year 2024 as more supply of its AI chips comes to market to meet insatiable demand. The market seems to have wrapped its head around this, with Wall Street analysts' consensus for next year's revenue pegged at nearly $91 billion, which implies a more than 50% increase."", 'But semiconductor sales tend to be cyclical. Periods of surging revenue are often followed by a slump. All eyes are now on what will happen in 2025. But for the record, on the last earnings call, Huang said he ""absolutely believe[s] that data center can grow through 2025.""', 'The jury is, of course, still out on this. At some point, I expect the world to take a breather on building new AI computing infrastructure. Perhaps that will finally arrive in 2025, or maybe it will delay until 2026 or later.', ""But if Huang is correct, and that the roughly $1 trillion global AI data-center opportunity continues to expand unabated over the next couple of years, Nvidia looks like a reasonably valued semiconductor stock. Shares trade for 25 times next year's (calendar year 2024) expected earnings per share. I have no plan on selling any of my position in Nvidia just yet as another busy year gets rolling."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): The IBM you see today is miles apart from the one-stop-IT-shop from the turn of the millennium. In a prescient yet painful strategy shift that started in 2012 and never really ended, Big Blue refocused its massive assets on the high-growth ""strategic imperatives"" of cloud computing, data security, analytics, and AI.', ""The watsonx.ai platform is a development platform custom-built for enterprise-scale businesses in search of machine learning and generative AI tools. It includes generative AI support in the app-writing experience and the option to generate apps in a drag-and-drop graphical interface rather than manual coding, and it relies on IBM's many decades of AI research."", ""And the company isn't resting on its digital laurels. The company has $11 billion of cash equivalents and generated $10.3 billion of free cash flow\xa0over the last four quarters. And those funds are aimed squarely at the AI opportunity right now."", 'For instance, IBM recently committed to training 2 million AI experts in the next three years, collaborating with universities around the world. It also started a $500 million investment fund focused on innovative AI start-ups.', ""As a result, IBM is poised to make up for its strategy-shifting pain with robust gains in the years to come. Trading at just 2.4 times trailing sales and 12.3 times free cash flow, IBM's stock looks like a no-brainer buy today."", ""Yet, market makers seem to have forgotten about the giant shadow IBM casts over the AI opportunity. The stock has only gained 16% in 2023, falling behind the S&P 500 index's 25% increase."", ""I don't mean to throw market-beating performers like Nvidia under the bus, and I own that stock myself. However, the chip designer's shares are changing hands at 27 times sales or 70 times free cash flow. If you're looking for a strong AI investment at the threshold of 2024, IBM combines fantastic growth prospects and an unbeatable AI history with bargain-bin share prices."", 'Billy Duberstein (ASML Holdings): A lot of artificial intelligence stocks have gone up a lot this year, so there aren\'t that many bargains left. However, ASML Holdings, at least by comparison, underperformed a lot of AI stocks, rising ""only"" 38% despite its machines being essential to the AI chipmaking process. In addition, the stock remains about 15% below its all-time high set back in late 2021, whereas many other semiconductor and AI stocks are now above those prior highs.', 'ASML data by YCharts.', 'There are several reasons for this year\'s underperformance. First, ASML is a European stock, so the relative performance of each market may have some effect. Second, ASML traded at a relatively higher valuation than other semiconductor-equipment companies coming into the year. So, there wasn\'t as much ground to ""make up"" after the 2022 sector plunge. Even now, ASML trades at 35 times earnings.', ""In addition, ASML management already said the company won't see much growth in 2024. This may be surprising, since most other semiconductor companies had a weak 2023 and now project a recovery year in 2024. However, ASML's growth has been a little different. During the pandemic, ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines were in such high demand and are so complicated and expensive to build that the production bottleneck stretched into this year. So, whereas many other semiconductor-equipment companies saw revenues decline in 2023, ASML will actually see 2023 revenue growth of about 30%. Only next year in 2024 will it endure the post-pandemic downturn effect."", ""However, as chip stocks tend to look ahead about a year, ASML could outperform some of its peers going into 2025. That's a year management has predicted will be a big growth year, as several new leading-edge fabs come online using ASML's latest EUV machines. In fact, ASML just shipped the first parts of its first high-numerical aperture (NA) EUV machine, the latest and most advanced model of EUV, to Intel. The high-NA machine is absolutely massive and will have to be shipped in 250 separate crates! Even though the first batch is being shipped now, production with them probably won't happen until late 2025."", ""While ASML stock isn't cheap, it has a monopoly on EUV technology needed to make chips below 7nm, which the industry just surpassed a couple of years ago. Last year's leading-edge chips, such as the Nvidia H100, were manufactured on the 5nm node, and 2023 saw the production of the first 3nm chips."", ""But the first 2nm chips will be made in 2025, which is the node in which both Samsung and Intel hope to catch up to foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in leading-edge logic chips. That intense competition for the 2nm node means all of these companies will be buying lots of ASML's machines to make those dreams a reality."", ""And the story doesn't end there, as all major dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturers will also begin using EUV to make DRAM chips going forward. While Samsung began using EUV two years ago, 2025 will also see Micron\xa0begin to use EUV for the first time in its memory production\xa0as the last memory holdout to use the complex process."", 'Generative AI will depend heavily on leading-edge processors and high-bandwidth memory, so look for ASML to perhaps outperform its peers in 2024 after lagging in 2023.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

It's been an incredible year for the company, but I believe 2024 could be even better."", 'That\'s because Amazon has only scratched the surface of its artificial intelligence (AI) potential. Indeed, in a recent interview with CNBC, CEO Andy Jassy said that ""generative AI is going to change every customer experience.""', ""AI could prove to be an enormous competitive advantage for Amazon, which prides itself on anticipating customers' wants and needs.

We think we have a real opportunity to be the leader there, and we\'re in the process of building a much more expansive large language model underneath Alexa that will make her both much more knowledgeable and much more conversational.""', ""In other words, get ready for a ChatGPT-like experience coming to an Alexa-enabled device near you soon. Need a new pair of shoes? Amazon wants you to talk with Alexa about the style you're looking for, compare prices, and then buy -- through an Amazon e-commerce partner, of course."", ""What's more, Amazon already has a massive treasure trove for training large language models -- its own data. With every search, review, or purchase, Amazon collects data that could be used to help it train and tailor its AI."", 'Amazon is something of a sleeping giant when it comes to AI. And 2024 could be the year that this goliath really springs to life.', 'Will Healy (Super Micro): Super Micro Computer is not a household name for AI or tech investors. But it existed for more than 30 years and it began by selling motherboards.', ""Today, it's best known for selling switches, servers, and solutions for storage and networking. However, it also offers combined hardware and software solutions that have become important amid the rise of generative AI."", 'Additionally, its rack-scale solutions support the cloud, metaverse, 5G, and edge infrastructure. Users may also like that Super Micro designs its products to save energy and minimize the impact on the environment. That growth helped it secure over 6 million square feet of manufacturing space and establish operations in more than 100 countries.', 'Thanks primarily to AI-driven interest, the AI stock is up more than 250% over the last year -- outperforming powerhouse AI stocks such as Nvidia and Palantir.', ""There's no guarantee Super Micro will repeat those results in 2024, and supply constraints and higher capital expenditures spending weighed on the financials. Its $2.1 billion in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30) grew 14% yearly after revenue had surged 37% higher in fiscal 2023. Also, fiscal Q1 net income of $157 million fell short of the $184 million earned in the same year-ago quarter."", 'Still, with the AI-driven growth in the pipeline, that decline will probably amount to a temporary setback. The company forecasts net sales of $10 billion to $11 billion, which would mean 47% growth at the midpoint.', ""Moreover, Super Micro's valuation significantly lags other AI giants despite the massive stock price gains. Its forward P/E ratio of 17 trails Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 40 and Palantir's forward valuation of almost 71.

The cardiovascular outcomes trial mentioned above is a big positive for Novo. It establishes the duopoly with Lilly in insulin management for Type 2 diabetics and weight loss for the huge number of overweight and obese people across the globe.', 'Novo has more legacy diabetes products that its newer drugs will cannibalize, but our research indicates that we can expect high-teens earnings per share growth from Novo over the next five years.

Netflix says you may be entitled to compensation. Motley Fool Money starts now. A little bit of news to get through and joining us to do that is Nick Sciple. Nick, good to see you.', 'Nick Sciple: Yeah. Great to be here with you Ricky.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Deidre likes doing M&A Mondays, but we got another pretty major acquisition going on to start us off on Tuesday. Occidental Petroleum, which engages in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, has agreed to buy CrownRock, a private energy producer, for $12 billion. Break this down. Why does Occidental want to buy CrownRock?', ""Nick Sciple: Well, this continue as a wave of really consolidation in the oil and gas industry, particularly in the Permian Basin, the shale patch in the US over the past year. Lots of folks recognizing that they've maybe used some of their best drilling inventory, looking to secure inventory for the long term. Occidental is one of those companies. These assets that they're acquiring from CrownRock are complementary to its existing portfolio in the Permian Basin. Gives them access to additional inventory in a basin that's starting to reach maturity is going to make them one of the largest producers in the Permian. Also, CEO Vicki Hollub has said it's going to give them the ability to weather downturns in a more robust way because CrownRocks wells have a little bit lower decline rates than that from what you see in their core portfolio. So to position them to be able to withstand a little bit different environments. Also worth noting here, looking at Occidental, the way they're structuring this deal using $10 billion in debt. A lot more aggressive than some of the other deals you've seen out there in the market. For example, Exxon went out there and bought Pioneer, used all stock in its transactions. So it continues the trend we've seen in the industry. But maybe a little bit more aggressive, which isn't out of the ordinary for Occidental. If you remember back to their acquisition of Anadarko just a few years ago."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, there's a little bit of oddness with the deal where they're taking out a lot of debt to do it. They're also simultaneously boosting their dividend and selling off other assets, which I think has raised some question marks among investors."", ""Nick Sciple: It'll be interesting to see what happens with those divestments. I think the number was 4.5 to $6 billion in divestments which they'll use to pay down some of that debt they're taking on to acquire CrownRock. Seeing where they sell off assets maybe tells you about the future of the business. Clearly, some attraction to the Permian Basin, maybe some other areas. The emphasize going forward."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, let's focus on the Permian Basin for a second. It's a massive oil fields primarily in West Texas. I think it goes out to New Mexico a little bit. ExxonMobil, purchasing Pioneer, natural resources to get a little bit more of a stake in that ground. Talk about the area, why is there such a rush for producers to get space in this area? It's been well-known for a while that there's a lot of oil in Texas, specifically in the Permian Basin."", ""Nick Sciple: I think it's a few things going on to, you mentioned the Permian Basin, the largest, most developed basin in the US. Among the lowest breakevens on the market. Makes it attractive for that reason. Also, as I mentioned earlier, some of the best acreage in the Permian Basin has been drilled. We're at the point where the basin is maturing. US oil production is at all time highs, but it's really only getting back to where we were in 2019. As some of these larger producers are looking to secure inventory for the long term, that makes the Permian attractive. Also, these folks have a lot of cash compared to where they were a couple years ago during the pandemic. Had a couple strong years. So you have some strong balance sheets, a position to go gobble up some of these assets at the same time oil prices are down, 20 percent or so in the past several months, maybe that positions some of these sellers to be a little bit more willing to bid up. So a lot of things going on at once that I think make for a robust deal environment."", 'Ricky Mulvey: So Warren Buffett has a large stake in Occidental Petroleum. He seems to have blessed this deal. There was a private jet visiting Omaha that captured some market commentators attention. The broader market is a little bit more skeptical. I think Occidental trading a little bit down on this news, so. So what do you think the disconnect here is between Mr. Buffett and Mr. Market?', ""Nick Sciple: Yeah, I think it's really this divergence you see in the markets in general. This divergence between what's going on in the near term and then expectations for the long term. In the near term as I mentioned, we've really seen oil prices fall significantly over 20 percent in the past several months. Concerns about weak demand in China, concerns that maybe these OPEC cuts that we've seen won't be as sticky as the market hopes. But long term, these inventory dynamics I talked about in the Permian continue to play out as we've used some of the best, some of the best rockets. In order to maintain these levels of production that we're seeing today, you're going to need to see some of this consolidation take place. I think near term, some skepticism about oil prices. I think the supply demand picture a lot more robust long term, more attractive looking long term. I think that's what these acquirers are seeing."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Friends become enemies. Enemies become friends. Let's move on to the next story. Disney and Netflix have agreed to a short-term domestic content agreement. Netflix is going to get to Stream 14 Library shows on a non-exclusive basis. Those include Grey's Anatomy, This is Us, and ESPN's 30 for 30 Library. Nick, this is a big deal, but what is the signal to you?"", ""Nick Sciple: I think this continues a trend of lots of folks in the entertainment landscape that had positioned themselves to maybe compete directly with Netflix now saying we can't compete with Netflix in the way that we had hoped. Challenges to Disney's maybe core cable business makes licensing this content to Netflix a little bit more attractive. You've seen that from other folks out there in the industry as well. When I think about this isn't the best Disney content out there. They're not putting Star Wars and Marvel, they're putting Grey's Anatomy and 30 for 30. But I think that this content is more, I guess, punches above its weight on Netflix platform than it does on some of these other platforms. The analogy I keep thinking about with this is like Netflix is like TV. Do you ever remember back in the days of cable when there'd be some movie on TV? Like, the classic Con Air, Nicholas Cage's movie. That's not a movie you would ever seek out to watch, but if it's on TV you might. I think Netflix is in that dynamic as well, where I don't think a lot of folks sought out suits when it was on other streaming platforms, but they watched it in droves on Netflix. Netflix is profitable. They're actually able to pay up for some of this content, and folks actually watched it on their platform, whereas they might get lost in some other streaming platform. I think it's a sign of Netflix's strength and they've kind of won the streaming war."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Unlike some other companies, Disney has been very careful to say the core properties are not going there. I think it's, to your point, it's a win for both companies. Because Disney gets to say, hey, we're not going to give you the Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars stuff, and Netflix, honestly, maybe they don't care because it's the shows that you can have on the background. Maybe in ESPN, 30 for 30 that you've watched a few other times. Back in June, Netflix made a licensing deal with Warner Brothers Discovery. It was about six months after David Zaslav asked his team to shut down deals between them and Netflix because he didn't like. It was like some certain deal that they had with the show Sandman. Now that's why you're seeing DC movies on Netflix as well as some HBO series on there. How did Netflix get into this position of strength? Why is Netflix in a position to be a buyer right now?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, I think Netflix is profitable in streaming in a way that many of these other folks aren't. They've been able to achieve scale and cash flow that other folks aren't able to achieve in streaming. Another thing that I think is worth noting, as well as Netflix doesn't have a legacy business to protect or legacy debt to support in the way that the Warner Brothers Discovery does. So Netflix's streaming business is profitable, gives them the ability to go buy up some of some of this content and these other companies frankly need it because of their financial situation."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, for Netflix, one thing I found interesting about them, and I think this deal shows it, is they spend a ton of money buying these long-running sitcoms and they've had very little success making them. They're happy to spend so much money on. For a while, it was the office. Now it's going to be Grey's Anatomy, and This Is Us. They don't make the stuff that they spend lots of money buying, they'd rather pay for the hits."", ""Nick Sciple: Yeah. I think the media business is an inherently an uncertain one when you're making content that does not yet have an audience out there. It's a lot easier to do that calculus for, licensed content that has an existing audience in place. I think if I am Netflix and I have the ability to pay a reasonable price for this content that has already made and already has an existing audience. I think that's a lot more attractive bet than trying to come up with a new property from zero. I think even Netflix's management has said, they're going to slow down a little bit on original production. Part of that is because they have access to license content in a way they maybe didn't expect to have a few years ago when competition was more intense."", ""Ricky Mulvey: A lot of traveling coming up for the holidays. People ask you for stock rec, sometimes, I'm not going to do that. You got any Netflix recs as we get to traveling for the holidays?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, on the topic of long-running sitcoms that Netflix didn't produce, I like to just play the hits, Seinfeld's on Netflix these days. I spend a lot of time watching that. That's one for me. If you want something new, I'm into the cult shows Escaping Twin Flames. Kept me glued to the couch for a few hours. Maybe check that one out as well if you're in cults and their craziness."", 'Ricky Mulvey: I asked you for a TV wreck and you had Seinfeld is number one and it is 2023 disciple. That\'s right. I\'ll throw out, if you like the docu-series, there\'s one that\'s excellent. Well, there\'s one I\'m going to recommend after we record, but I don\'t want to recommend it on a wide-scale basis. MerPeople is phenomenal. It is the subculture of people who are mermaids. It is a three-part documentary series. It is honestly, it is one of the strongest stories that has hooked me in, where a mermaid in Arkansas has to go on the hero\'s journey so she can live out her dream. Shout Out Sparkles. As we move to our next story. Alphabet versus Epic, the video game maker Epic seems to have a major win. They\'re known for making Fortnight. A jury in Northern California said that Google basically has monopoly power over the Android app market. Google did anti-competitive things, and moreover, Epic was hurt by those practices. Google shareholders really don\'t seem to mind. You\'ve also got a Bloomberg headlining saying, ""This decision could upend the mobile app economy"". Nick Sciple. What say you?', ""Nick Sciple: Well, certainly always worth paying attention to whenever Google loses an antitrust case, has been long debated whether those App Store fees, I think it's 15 percent on the baseline that Google and Apple charge, aren't monopoly profits. We finally have a jury that has made that ruling. Now, are we going to upend the mobile app economy? We'll see the Court still needs to determine the appropriate remedies to take. They're going to hold a hearing in January to decide what steps to take to fix this anti-competitive industry. But whatever choices that Court makes could lead the way we go about buying apps and consuming them different in the future than it has been today. Certainly could mean that the money that Google and Apple are able to achieve from those app stores smaller in the future."", ""Ricky Mulvey: One of the crux of it seems to be that Epic wanted to make their own app store within Google, which technically Google allows, of course. Or the Epic complaint is essentially put up this warning screen, like if you download this app store, you're opening yourself up to all these viruses, that sort of thing and that may have been anti-competitive. But what do you think the implications are if software developers can go on these platforms, Google and Apple, and make their own app stores? I would say this outcome seems unlikely, but not impossible."", ""Nick Sciple: It certainly would be gravity for the amount of fees that Google and Apple are able to charge for folks to transact through the App Store. It would be in the interest of consumers to save a little bit of money by doing things that way. I think to the extent you see those royalties fall for Google and Apple than folks who sell via those app stores, that presumably would fall to the bottom line for a company like Match Group or Spotify or other it's out there in the market. So a shrinking profit pool for some of these big companies could open up additional profits for other businesses. You think about a company like Valve with Steam. Steam is really a dominant app purchase platform. And you think about games online. Could all of a sudden Steam compete more directly with Google and Apple when it comes to the games ecosystem? Something like that could be interesting."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We're not the only ones watching this story. I'm sure the C suite of Apple has checked out the headline this morning. How do you think Apple's taking this news?"", ""Nick Sciple: Well, you recall Apple was able to prevail over App, at least a judge was able to rule in their favor. Didn't get to a jury trial. To the extent this ruling sticks, again, this is a meaningful threat to Apple's App store, which gives them an advantage over others in the, in the Apple ecosystem. So I think if I'm Apple, I would be worried. But we'll see what the court does next. What remedies they choose, how much that will impact the future for Apple."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Nick Sciple, thank you for your time and your insight. I'll see you later this week. Looking forward to it."", ""Nick Sciple: Looking forward to seeing you in DC for Foolapalooza. It's been a long time. Excited to get back."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Coming up on the end of the year, and one thing we get is a lot of people trying to improve their financial situation as they begin the New Year.

We're also going to be recording a mail bag with Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick next week. If you have personal finance questions for them, that's a great place to do it. Up next, Mark Kantrowitz is a nationally recognized expert on student financial aid, scholarships, and college savings plans. He's also the author of five books, including How to appeal for more college financial aid. Robert Brokamp spoke with Kantrowitz about recent changes to the financial application process. Who's going to get more aid and who will end up actually paying more?"", ""Robert Brokamp: The free application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA, is usually available on October 1, but it's been delayed this year while the Department of Education makes significant changes to the form and how aid is determined. So Mark what are some of the biggest differences between the old FAFSA, the new FAFSA, which supposedly will be available sometime on or before December 31st."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: The new FAFSA is much shorter and simpler than the old FAFSA. They got rid of about two thirds of the questions. Can't say the exact number, because a lot depends on the particular circumstances of the student and their family. But on average we're going to see one third as many questions. Which means instead of taking an hour, it might take 15, 20 minutes for people to complete the form. That's one big change. Another change is that it will become easier for students to qualify for the Pell Grant. There will be more financial aid for low income students, but there are several changes that make it harder for middle and high income students to qualify for aid. For example, they get rid of the sibling loophole, which divided the parent contribution by the number of children in college. So a parent who had $100,000 of income was approximately the same as a parent who has $50,000 in income if the parent with a six figure income had twice as many children in college at the same time. They're also getting rid of the small business exclusion. Small businesses will count as an asset and the family farm exclusion. Now, a more recent problem, FAFSA includes a whole bunch of different tables of numbers that are supposed to be adjusted for inflation. An example is the income protection allowance shelters a portion of the family income. There's also an income protection allowance for the student income. The US Department of Education is not doing that inflation adjustment, even though it's required by law this year. They will do it for the 2025, 26 FAFSA. But they're saying that the timeline is too tight and it's too complicated for them to do right now, so they'll need to hunt on it for this year. But that means that the typical student is going to qualify for thousands of dollars less financial aid then they're entitled to. I don't think that's right."", ""Robert Brokamp: Yeah, I saw you quoted in a CNBC article about this. Do you think this is something that if there's enough of an uproar about it that they will change or is it really just too late?"", ""Mark Kantrowitz: Well, it may be too late because they're already seem to be running right up against the deadline. So the due date for the FAFSA, as you noted, is going to be December 31st instead of October 1st. That's not that big a deal, and if you go back eight years, the FAFSA had to start date of January 1st. It wasn't ideal, but the switch to October 1st was an improvement. But it's not just that students will only be able to start submitting the FAFSA on December 31st. It's also the colleges are not going to get a copy of the students FAFSA information until late January. That pushes the schedule for getting financial aid award offers to the students back significantly. I wouldn't be surprised if college financial aid offers are made in late March or early April as opposed to early March. Because of this, if the colleges squeeze the schedule as much as they can, who knows what problems there may be with this FAFSA, there hasn't been any public beta testing of it. So there could be a lot of glitches when it first launches."", 'Robert Brokamp: Wow. People, be prepared to be patient and maybe be delayed on getting your aid package.', 'Mark Kantrowitz: Yes.', ""Robert Brokamp: Let's talk about a couple other changes that I believe are coming. One is the change in the way the FAFSA handles divorced parents. What's going to be different about."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: So when the parents are divorced or separated or never married. If they live together, they're treated as though they're married. But if they live apart, then only one parent is responsible for completing the FAFSA. This used to be the parent with whom the child lived the most. But starting with the 2024, 25, it'll be the parent who provided the most financial support to the student in the 12 months ending on the date the FAFSA is filed. Now if the parents provide an equal amount of financial support, then it'll be whichever parent has a greater income, counting the income of any step-parents, that gives the parents an incentive to make sure that it's a parent with a lower income who provides more support so that the student will qualify for more financial aid."", ""Robert Brokamp: Another change is grandparents owned 529, a lot of grandparents, they opened 529 for their grand-kids in the past form the assets were not included on the FAFSA but distributions from those 529 were counted as untaxed income. But as I understand it, that's going away so that it's almost like the FAFSA doesn't know anything about any grandparent 529."", ""Mark Kantrowitz: There used to be a question on the FAFSA called the cash support question, which is where you would report untaxed income to the student. There was no similar question for parents. That question has been eliminated and that's where you would report distributions from grandparent on 529 plans and also gifts to the student from grandparents, aunts and uncles. And it's not just grandparents, it's anybody other than the student or the student's custodial parent. So the treatment for a custodial five to nine plans that are owned by the student or the five to nine plan that is owned by a dependent student's parent, that hasn't changed, those are still reported as parent assets on the FAFSA. There is one slight change which is if the parent owns a five to nine plan, not just for the student but for the student's siblings, the five to nine plans for the student's siblings are not going to be reported on the FAFSA so that will yield an improvement. So you're not counting your brother or sisters as five to nine plan against your aid eligibility. So there's a couple of changes here and the change in the treatment of 5-9 plans owned by the grandparent, aunts, uncles, or anybody other than the student or parent, that is a significant positive change in that it makes those 5-9 plans disappear. They aren't reported as an asset and distribution. Qualified distributions aren't counted as untaxed income on the FAFSA. Now, if you make a non-qualified distribution, that is going to show up in your adjusted gross income and that will affect your financial aid eligibility. But so long as you use the 5-9 plans the way they were intended if it's owned by a grandparent, it has no impact."", ""Robert Brokamp: So putting it all together who's going to benefit the most from these changes and who's eligibility for aid is actually going to be reduced due to these changes?"", ""Mark Kantrowitz: Well, there are a bunch of cross currents. So generally low income students will get more aid. The Pell Grant formula has a new secondary formula on top of the existing formula. The secondary formula compares the family income to two thresholds based on a multiple other poverty line. So if your parent's income is less than 175% of the poverty line, you're going to get the maximum Pell Grant regardless of what the primary formula says, and if the income is less than another threshold, which depends on whether a single parent household or a two-parent household. But if you are under that threshold, you're going to get at least a minimum Pell Grant. These changes mean that more than 500,000 additional students will qualify for a Pell Grant and of all the students who qualify for a Pell Grant, an additional 1.5 million of them will qualify for the maximum Pell Grant. There will be more grant money being awarded to low-income students. More of them are going to qualify and more of them are going to get the maximum grant. That means low-income students are generally going to benefit significantly from the new form. Middle and high-income families may have a decrease in their aid eligibility. It used to be that families with six-figure incomes could nevertheless qualify for a Pell Grant. If they had multiple children in college at the same time, that's no longer going to be there. They won't qualify many of them for the Pell Grant. Now the change with regard to grandparent-owned 5-9 plans, that's going to be a benefit, especially when the grandparents are wealthy but the family is not, it's hard to predict any individual have a generality that says, oh, all these students are not going to get more aid or to get less aid. And these aren't, but we have these general trends. Low-income students get more financial aid, middle and high-income students get less financial aid."", 'Robert Brokamp: It definitely seems to me like if you have kids in college, like I do now, I have three kids in college. You pay a certain amount this year based on how you filled out the face. There could be a significant difference for next year if you have multiple kids or if you own that farm or if you own that business.', ""Mark Kantrowitz: Yes, definitely. Necessarily from the federal government or the state government, but maybe from the colleges themselves. You will get less financial aid because of that change in the student name index, which is the new name for the EFC. Now I would recommend appealing to the college. Point out that last year you got a certain amount of financial aid, and this year you're getting much less, even though your income hasn't changed. Now what I think some colleges may do is try to hold the family harmless if you're a returning student. If you're a brand new student, you might not get any adjustments. But the colleges are concerned about the potential shock to the family finances from if they have like three kids in college at the same time. And each of them gets $3,000 less financial aid, that's perhaps as much as $10,000 less aid. And it'll vary significantly from one family to the next in terms of the impact that may make it very difficult for the family to afford that college education."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

Since US copyright law, which was last updated by Congress in 1998, allows copyright to be held for 95 years, Disney’s sole claim to the character is about to end.', 'Mickey isn’t the only classic character to enter the public domain in recent years. On January 1, 2022, the copyright on A. A. Milne’s original Winnie the Pooh character also expired. That has opened the door for more creative interpretations of the anthropomorphic teddy bear, including the 2023 slasher film, “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.”', 'Will we similarly see Disney’s mouse mascot reimagined? Stacey Lee, a Johns Hopkins Carey Business School professor, said it’s possible — but with caveats.', '“You can take ‘Steamboat Willie’ and do whatever you want with him,” she said.', '“However, Mickey Mouse, as we traditionally think of him, is trademarked, so he’s still very much the ownership of Disney.”', 'There are differences between the 1928 Mickey and the company’s mascot today.

In such volatile times, smart stock selection becomes paramount."", ""This is where a ready wish list of reliable stocks becomes invaluable -- companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) that offer stability even during economic turmoil."", ""Conversely, Global-e Online (NASDAQ: GLBE) emerges as a more turbulent player, potentially rocked by the market's seismic shifts."", ""Coca-Cola is an investment powerhouse with a fizz felt in every corner of the globe. This beverage behemoth quenches investors' desire for stability with operations spanning over 200 countries. In the roller coaster of the third quarter, Coca-Cola poured out an impressive 8% surge in net revenues to a refreshing $12 billion, demonstrating not just a spike but a steady climb in its financial performance."", ""The company is also a leader in dividends -- those regular payouts that sweeten your investment pot. Since 1963, it's been boosting its dividend annually. At its recent share prices, its last distribution of $0.46 per share gives it an annualized yield of approximately 3.1%, providing a steady stream to enrich your investment pool, which will be especially appealing when the markets turn rough."", ""However, Coca-Cola navigates a maze of fierce rivals, ever-changing consumer preferences, and intricate global supply chains. It remains on top largely through its proven ability to adapt, its extensive network, and a knack for striking a chord with consumers across the globe.

The third quarter witnessed a notable 35% year-over-year increase in gross merchandise volume alongside a 27% revenue jump, signaling Global-e's robust position in the burgeoning e-commerce industry."", ""Yet the allure of Global-e's rapid ascent is tempered by the specter of higher risk, which would become particularly noticeable if the markets waver. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, perched at an elevated 45.9, is a premium valuation, placing it in a precarious position when markets are skittish. Furthermore, its beta of 1.16 reveals a greater susceptibility to market gyrations, with Global-e's share price on average experiencing swings that are 16% more pronounced than the broader market, a matter of concern amid financial turbulence."", ""Global-e's operational model, centered on enabling global e-commerce, navigates the labyrinth of international trade laws, shifting regulatory landscapes, and consumer sentiment that can swiftly change with economic tides.

With its future tethered to the relentless pace of e-commerce innovation and an arena rife with fierce competition and regulatory complexities, Global-e's journey is one of high potential yet equally high risk. For investors, this juxtaposition of opportunity and vulnerability warrants a cautious approach, especially as storm clouds gather on the economic horizon."", ""Savvy investors know the importance of a well-curated wish list.

Coca-Cola and McDonald's, with their blends of stability and adaptability, make prime candidates for your wish list, promising not just survival but potential growth, or at least likely dividends, in a downturn.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, you can look at the 5 Cheapest Stocks in Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2024."", 'Warren Buffett is one of the most successful money managers on Wall Street. Backed by a highly experienced investment team that included Charlie Munger, Buffett succeeded in returning\xa0nearly 20% in annualized returns, double the S&P 500 returns, since the mid-1960s. Berkshire Hathaway has always been his investment vehicle for pursuing hi-low risk, high-value opportunities in the broader stock market.', 'The ""oracle of Omaha,"" as he is commonly known, Buffett, has relied on an investment strategy that focuses on highly undervalued stocks in various sectors. Worth\xa0over $100 billion, he invests in businesses that he believes are backed by solid business models. He also leverages their dividends and earnings to increase his investments gradually.', 'Value investing is the strategy the legendary investor has perfected for discovering stocks trading below their intrinsic value. Buffett is fond of carrying out in-depth discounted cash flow analysis when determining whether stocks are trading below their intrinsic value.', ""The analysis entails closely monitoring a company's financial statements to project revenues, costs, and net income. The figures are then used to determine cash flows, which are discounted to their present value and divided with outstanding shares to provide an intrinsic value per share."", ""A stock is deemed undervalued if the intrinsic value per share is below the current market share price. Given the success of the discounted cash flow analysis over the years, it could help in selecting the cheapest stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio heading into 2024."", 'Nevertheless, Buffett does not entirely rely on discounted cash flow analysis to determine the cheapest stocks worth investing in. The investor is also known to pay close attention to price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples as they provide valuable insights on how the stock trades relative to its future earnings, expectations, and overall market.', 'Stocks trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of less than 20 have always proved ideal investment plays. Additionally, a stock trading with a P/E that is less than the market average is often deemed to be trading at a discount, significantly if its revenues and earnings grow at an impressive rate. A\xa0lower P/E ratio tends to be\xa0favourable as it means one will pays less for each dollar earnings the company generates.', 'In addition to profiting from share price appreciation by investing in highly undervalued stocks, Buffett is also a lover of dividends. The hedge fund manager is fond of investing in stocks\xa0with an impressive track record in returning value to shareholders. Coca-Cola and American Express are some of the oldest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway that Buffett has always stuck to, owing to their enticing dividend yields.', 'Unlike most investors who tend to spend their dividends, Buffett reinvests dividends as one of the ways of increasing the value of his investment over time. The strategy is often deemed a passive investment whereby Buffett focuses on a stock with an impressive track record in paying dividends and then holding for years to generate passive income. The love for compounding is one of the factors that has propelled Buffett into a billionaire investor.', 'Heading into 2024, valuation levels in the equity markets appear stretched. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up by about 55% for the year; the S&P 500 has gained about 21%. The impressive gains come against the optimism that the US Federal Reserve has peaked on its monetary policy tightening spree.', ""In the first three quarters of the year, Buffett sold $28.7 billion worth of stocks and bought less than $5 billion. The sell-off spree affirms caution in taking up new positions, according to economists, and should ring alarm bells. According to Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, the sell-off and a move to accumulate $157 billion in cash signals Buffett's concerns about valuation levels, and therefore, he refrained from putting his massive cash hoard into use."", 'Expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates as early as next year have been the catalyst fuelling the buying spree in the market. Likewise, stocks have rallied, and valuations have gotten out of hand.', ""Nevertheless, the cheapest stocks in Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2024 could provide a way out of the valuation dilemma.\xa0The stocks are spread across various sectors, ideal for any investor looking to diversify their investment portfolio. In addition, most stocks are trading below their intrinsic value and offer a way of generating passive income through dividends."", 'Our Methodology', ""Buffett is one of the best in picking highly undervalued stocks likely to explode and generate long-term value on share price gains and dividends.

Coca-Cola and McDonald's, with their blends of stability and adaptability, make prime candidates for your wish list, promising not just survival but potential growth, or at least likely dividends, in a downturn.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, you can look at the 5 Cheapest Stocks in Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2024."", 'Warren Buffett is one of the most successful money managers on Wall Street. Backed by a highly experienced investment team that included Charlie Munger, Buffett succeeded in returning\xa0nearly 20% in annualized returns, double the S&P 500 returns, since the mid-1960s. Berkshire Hathaway has always been his investment vehicle for pursuing hi-low risk, high-value opportunities in the broader stock market.', 'The ""oracle of Omaha,"" as he is commonly known, Buffett, has relied on an investment strategy that focuses on highly undervalued stocks in various sectors. Worth\xa0over $100 billion, he invests in businesses that he believes are backed by solid business models. He also leverages their dividends and earnings to increase his investments gradually.', 'Value investing is the strategy the legendary investor has perfected for discovering stocks trading below their intrinsic value. Buffett is fond of carrying out in-depth discounted cash flow analysis when determining whether stocks are trading below their intrinsic value.', ""The analysis entails closely monitoring a company's financial statements to project revenues, costs, and net income. The figures are then used to determine cash flows, which are discounted to their present value and divided with outstanding shares to provide an intrinsic value per share."", ""A stock is deemed undervalued if the intrinsic value per share is below the current market share price. Given the success of the discounted cash flow analysis over the years, it could help in selecting the cheapest stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio heading into 2024."", 'Nevertheless, Buffett does not entirely rely on discounted cash flow analysis to determine the cheapest stocks worth investing in. The investor is also known to pay close attention to price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples as they provide valuable insights on how the stock trades relative to its future earnings, expectations, and overall market.', 'Stocks trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of less than 20 have always proved ideal investment plays. Additionally, a stock trading with a P/E that is less than the market average is often deemed to be trading at a discount, significantly if its revenues and earnings grow at an impressive rate. A\xa0lower P/E ratio tends to be\xa0favourable as it means one will pays less for each dollar earnings the company generates.', 'In addition to profiting from share price appreciation by investing in highly undervalued stocks, Buffett is also a lover of dividends. The hedge fund manager is fond of investing in stocks\xa0with an impressive track record in returning value to shareholders. Coca-Cola and American Express are some of the oldest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway that Buffett has always stuck to, owing to their enticing dividend yields.', 'Unlike most investors who tend to spend their dividends, Buffett reinvests dividends as one of the ways of increasing the value of his investment over time. The strategy is often deemed a passive investment whereby Buffett focuses on a stock with an impressive track record in paying dividends and then holding for years to generate passive income. The love for compounding is one of the factors that has propelled Buffett into a billionaire investor.', 'Heading into 2024, valuation levels in the equity markets appear stretched. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up by about 55% for the year; the S&P 500 has gained about 21%. The impressive gains come against the optimism that the US Federal Reserve has peaked on its monetary policy tightening spree.', ""In the first three quarters of the year, Buffett sold $28.7 billion worth of stocks and bought less than $5 billion. The sell-off spree affirms caution in taking up new positions, according to economists, and should ring alarm bells. According to Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, the sell-off and a move to accumulate $157 billion in cash signals Buffett's concerns about valuation levels, and therefore, he refrained from putting his massive cash hoard into use."", 'Expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates as early as next year have been the catalyst fuelling the buying spree in the market. Likewise, stocks have rallied, and valuations have gotten out of hand.', ""Nevertheless, the cheapest stocks in Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2024 could provide a way out of the valuation dilemma.\xa0The stocks are spread across various sectors, ideal for any investor looking to diversify their investment portfolio. In addition, most stocks are trading below their intrinsic value and offer a way of generating passive income through dividends."", 'Our Methodology', ""Buffett is one of the best in picking highly undervalued stocks likely to explode and generate long-term value on share price gains and dividends.

Backed by a highly experienced investment team that included Charlie Munger, Buffett succeeded in returning\xa0nearly 20% in annualized returns, double the S&P 500 returns, since the mid-1960s. Berkshire Hathaway has always been his investment vehicle for pursuing hi-low risk, high-value opportunities in the broader stock market.', 'The ""oracle of Omaha,"" as he is commonly known, Buffett, has relied on an investment strategy that focuses on highly undervalued stocks in various sectors. Worth\xa0over $100 billion, he invests in businesses that he believes are backed by solid business models. He also leverages their dividends and earnings to increase his investments gradually.', 'Value investing is the strategy the legendary investor has perfected for discovering stocks trading below their intrinsic value. Buffett is fond of carrying out in-depth discounted cash flow analysis when determining whether stocks are trading below their intrinsic value.', ""The analysis entails closely monitoring a company's financial statements to project revenues, costs, and net income. The figures are then used to determine cash flows, which are discounted to their present value and divided with outstanding shares to provide an intrinsic value per share."", ""A stock is deemed undervalued if the intrinsic value per share is below the current market share price. Given the success of the discounted cash flow analysis over the years, it could help in selecting the cheapest stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio heading into 2024."", 'Nevertheless, Buffett does not entirely rely on discounted cash flow analysis to determine the cheapest stocks worth investing in. The investor is also known to pay close attention to price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples as they provide valuable insights on how the stock trades relative to its future earnings, expectations, and overall market.', 'Stocks trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of less than 20 have always proved ideal investment plays. Additionally, a stock trading with a P/E that is less than the market average is often deemed to be trading at a discount, significantly if its revenues and earnings grow at an impressive rate. A\xa0lower P/E ratio tends to be\xa0favourable as it means one will pays less for each dollar earnings the company generates.', 'In addition to profiting from share price appreciation by investing in highly undervalued stocks, Buffett is also a lover of dividends. The hedge fund manager is fond of investing in stocks\xa0with an impressive track record in returning value to shareholders. Coca-Cola and American Express are some of the oldest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway that Buffett has always stuck to, owing to their enticing dividend yields.', 'Unlike most investors who tend to spend their dividends, Buffett reinvests dividends as one of the ways of increasing the value of his investment over time. The strategy is often deemed a passive investment whereby Buffett focuses on a stock with an impressive track record in paying dividends and then holding for years to generate passive income. The love for compounding is one of the factors that has propelled Buffett into a billionaire investor.', 'Heading into 2024, valuation levels in the equity markets appear stretched. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up by about 55% for the year; the S&P 500 has gained about 21%. The impressive gains come against the optimism that the US Federal Reserve has peaked on its monetary policy tightening spree.', ""In the first three quarters of the year, Buffett sold $28.7 billion worth of stocks and bought less than $5 billion. The sell-off spree affirms caution in taking up new positions, according to economists, and should ring alarm bells. According to Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, the sell-off and a move to accumulate $157 billion in cash signals Buffett's concerns about valuation levels, and therefore, he refrained from putting his massive cash hoard into use."", 'Expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates as early as next year have been the catalyst fuelling the buying spree in the market. Likewise, stocks have rallied, and valuations have gotten out of hand.', ""Nevertheless, the cheapest stocks in Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2024 could provide a way out of the valuation dilemma.\xa0The stocks are spread across various sectors, ideal for any investor looking to diversify their investment portfolio.

To qualify for this designation, a company must achieve at least 50 years of consecutive annual dividend growth.', 'With these half-century long dividend track records, these companies clearly demonstrate consistent profitability. And they are devoted to maximizing shareholder value, via the return of excess capital.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'So, with a few dozen dividend kings out there, only a few stand out as strong opportunities heading into 2024.', 'The following seven dividend kings offer not only steady returns from their consistent, growing payouts, but also solid appreciation potential.', 'On top of being poised to deliver strong total returns thanks to dividend and earnings growth, these kings also stand to benefit from the improving macro outlook (cooling inflation, the prospect of lower interest rates). Let’s explore them.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'Founded in 1962, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the oldest REITs. Therefore, it makes sense that FRT holds dividend king status. REITs pay the lion’s share of their earnings out as distributions, and typically, REITs (at least, successful REITs) experience steady earnings growth.', 'FRT stock has raised its dividend 56 years in a row. At current prices, shares sport a forward yield of around 4.22%. FRT’s payouts have grown by just 1.5% annually on average over the past five years. And forecasts call for its funds from operations (or FFO, the REIT equivalent to earnings) to grow just 2.9% next year.', 'So then, what makes this royal REIT a buy? That would be the likely forthcoming interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. REITs (which are highly sensitive to interest rate changes) could receive a boost FRT is no exception.', 'Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com', 'Soft drink and snack foods giant Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) is, like its rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), one of the dividend kings. PEP has raised its payout 51 years in a row. Also, over the past five years, they have grown by an average of 6.63% annually.', 'This relatively high dividend growth rate is but one reason PEP stock may be a better king to buy and hold than KO stock. Despite a longer dividend growth track record (61 years), KO’s payouts have only increased by an average of 3.36% annually. That’s not all. As a Zacks commentator pointed out back in October, PEP has outperformed KO over the past 25 years.', 'This outperformance could continue, given PEP’s higher expected earnings growth rate in 2024 (7.94%) versus its “Cola wars” rival (4.48%). Hence, both stocks could also experience multiple expansion thanks to lower interest rates.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'RPM International (NYSE:RPM) has received some increased attention lately, thanks to a recent profile in Barron’s. As detailed in the article, this manufacturer of coatings and building materials has just earned “dividend king” status this year.', 'However, that may not necessarily be the main appeal with RPM stock. RPM’s payout is relatively modest (1.65%), even if it has increased by around 12.4% annually over the past five years. What is really appealing is the prospect of continued earnings growth.', 'Through both the execution of a successful “bolt-on” acquisition strategy, plus the implementation of a company-wide program to maximize operating performance, not to mention the potential impact of cooling inflation and lower interest rates on demand for its various products, RPM appears poised to prosper in the coming year. With this, consider it one of the dividend stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.com', 'Among the dividend kings, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) is admittedly a bit pricey. Shares in the credit rating and benchmark index provider currently trade for around 34.4 times forward earnings.

Over the past five years, payouts have increased nearly 12.5% annually on average. Forecasts call for earnings growth next year of around 14.4%.', 'An improving macro environment, plus the company’s earnings beat/guidance raise last quarter, points to S&P Global meeting, if not also beating, these forecasts. If this happens, not only could it help sustain SPGI’s stock price and propel it higher. Such an earnings increase points to similarly-sized dividend increases in the future.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'Food product and kitchen equipment wholesaler Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock well-known for its dividend king status. Sysco has increased its dividend payout 55 years in a row.', 'SYY currently has a forward yield of 2.72%. Payout growth for Sysco over the past five years has averaged 6.58% annually. Although SYY has bounced back strongly in recent weeks, shares may not be at risk of topping out anytime soon. Gradual gains could continue into 2024.', 'Why? As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, the company continues to grow/enhance its business, through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Also, Sysco is strong in the share repurchase department, committing $750 million to buybacks this fiscal year (ending June 2024). These factors, plus easing inflation, may mean additional improvements in sentiment for SYY over the next twelve months.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Target (NYSE:TGT) is a dividend king, with 55 years of consecutive annual dividend growth. Currently, shares in the big box retailing giant have a forward dividend yield of 3.16%. Payouts have increased by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.', 'With this, investors looking for a dividend growth stock with a moderate-sized yield may want to consider TGT stock. However, that’s not to say there’s little reason to buy Target shares, if you’re focused on capital growth. There may be room for Target to bridge its valuation gap (16.7 times earnings versus 24 times earnings) with main rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT).', 'Until recently, concerns about the impact of inflation on consumer spending habits has placed pressure on TGT. However, considering the inflation cooldown, stronger results may be ahead. In turn, this may improve the market’s view on shares, leading to multiple expansion.', 'Source: Maridav/ShutterStock.com', 'Among the top dividend stocks, Tennant (NYSE:TNC) is one of the least-known. Despite being in business for over 150 years, this particular dividend king, which is a leading name in the cleaning equipment market, is anything but a household name.', 'However, the under-the-radar status of TNC stock may work to your advantage.

Beyond Meat is considering a dramatic restructuring process, on the other hand, that's still not guaranteed to shift the business into sustainable profitability."", ""Pepsi's shares declined 7% in 2023, meaning it trailed the S&P 500 by roughly 30 percentage points.

To qualify for this designation, a company must achieve at least 50 years of consecutive annual dividend growth.', 'With these half-century long dividend track records, these companies clearly demonstrate consistent profitability. And they are devoted to maximizing shareholder value, via the return of excess capital.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'So, with a few dozen dividend kings out there, only a few stand out as strong opportunities heading into 2024.', 'The following seven dividend kings offer not only steady returns from their consistent, growing payouts, but also solid appreciation potential.', 'On top of being poised to deliver strong total returns thanks to dividend and earnings growth, these kings also stand to benefit from the improving macro outlook (cooling inflation, the prospect of lower interest rates). Let’s explore them.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'Founded in 1962, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the oldest REITs. Therefore, it makes sense that FRT holds dividend king status. REITs pay the lion’s share of their earnings out as distributions, and typically, REITs (at least, successful REITs) experience steady earnings growth.', 'FRT stock has raised its dividend 56 years in a row. At current prices, shares sport a forward yield of around 4.22%. FRT’s payouts have grown by just 1.5% annually on average over the past five years. And forecasts call for its funds from operations (or FFO, the REIT equivalent to earnings) to grow just 2.9% next year.', 'So then, what makes this royal REIT a buy? That would be the likely forthcoming interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. REITs (which are highly sensitive to interest rate changes) could receive a boost FRT is no exception.', 'Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com', 'Soft drink and snack foods giant Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) is, like its rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), one of the dividend kings. PEP has raised its payout 51 years in a row. Also, over the past five years, they have grown by an average of 6.63% annually.', 'This relatively high dividend growth rate is but one reason PEP stock may be a better king to buy and hold than KO stock. Despite a longer dividend growth track record (61 years), KO’s payouts have only increased by an average of 3.36% annually. That’s not all. As a Zacks commentator pointed out back in October, PEP has outperformed KO over the past 25 years.', 'This outperformance could continue, given PEP’s higher expected earnings growth rate in 2024 (7.94%) versus its “Cola wars” rival (4.48%). Hence, both stocks could also experience multiple expansion thanks to lower interest rates.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'RPM International (NYSE:RPM) has received some increased attention lately, thanks to a recent profile in Barron’s. As detailed in the article, this manufacturer of coatings and building materials has just earned “dividend king” status this year.', 'However, that may not necessarily be the main appeal with RPM stock. RPM’s payout is relatively modest (1.65%), even if it has increased by around 12.4% annually over the past five years. What is really appealing is the prospect of continued earnings growth.', 'Through both the execution of a successful “bolt-on” acquisition strategy, plus the implementation of a company-wide program to maximize operating performance, not to mention the potential impact of cooling inflation and lower interest rates on demand for its various products, RPM appears poised to prosper in the coming year. With this, consider it one of the dividend stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.com', 'Among the dividend kings, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) is admittedly a bit pricey. Shares in the credit rating and benchmark index provider currently trade for around 34.4 times forward earnings. Yet while SPGI is by no means a value stock, dividend and growth investors alike may want to consider it.', 'SPGI stock has a relatively low dividend yield (0.83%), but payouts have grown 50 years in a row. Over the past five years, payouts have increased nearly 12.5% annually on average. Forecasts call for earnings growth next year of around 14.4%.', 'An improving macro environment, plus the company’s earnings beat/guidance raise last quarter, points to S&P Global meeting, if not also beating, these forecasts. If this happens, not only could it help sustain SPGI’s stock price and propel it higher. Such an earnings increase points to similarly-sized dividend increases in the future.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'Food product and kitchen equipment wholesaler Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock well-known for its dividend king status. Sysco has increased its dividend payout 55 years in a row.', 'SYY currently has a forward yield of 2.72%. Payout growth for Sysco over the past five years has averaged 6.58% annually. Although SYY has bounced back strongly in recent weeks, shares may not be at risk of topping out anytime soon. Gradual gains could continue into 2024.', 'Why? As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, the company continues to grow/enhance its business, through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Also, Sysco is strong in the share repurchase department, committing $750 million to buybacks this fiscal year (ending June 2024). These factors, plus easing inflation, may mean additional improvements in sentiment for SYY over the next twelve months.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Target (NYSE:TGT) is a dividend king, with 55 years of consecutive annual dividend growth. Currently, shares in the big box retailing giant have a forward dividend yield of 3.16%. Payouts have increased by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.', 'With this, investors looking for a dividend growth stock with a moderate-sized yield may want to consider TGT stock. However, that’s not to say there’s little reason to buy Target shares, if you’re focused on capital growth. There may be room for Target to bridge its valuation gap (16.7 times earnings versus 24 times earnings) with main rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT).', 'Until recently, concerns about the impact of inflation on consumer spending habits has placed pressure on TGT. However, considering the inflation cooldown, stronger results may be ahead. In turn, this may improve the market’s view on shares, leading to multiple expansion.', 'Source: Maridav/ShutterStock.com', 'Among the top dividend stocks, Tennant (NYSE:TNC) is one of the least-known. Despite being in business for over 150 years, this particular dividend king, which is a leading name in the cleaning equipment market, is anything but a household name.', 'However, the under-the-radar status of TNC stock may work to your advantage. Shares trade at a more-than-reasonable 15.5 times forward earnings. The stock has a 1.22% yield, which has grown by an average of 4.81% over the past five years.', 'Most importantly, Tennant’s earnings are expected to grow at a double-digit clip, both in 2024 and 2025. If the market becomes more aware of TNC and its outstanding earnings growth prospects, the stock may not just rise in tandem with increased earnings. A move to a higher forward multiple may be attainable as well.

The prospects of a looser monetary policy in the next year have served to propel major indexes of the market to swing upwards in recent months. The S&P 500 is up more than 24%, the NASDAQ Composite is up over 44%, while the Dow Jones has registered gains of around 14%. Double digits growth for all three indexes in 2023 is a remarkable turnaround from 2022.\xa0', 'Some of the major reasons for this include slowing inflation, steady consumer spending, a resilient labor market, and expert predictions about a soft landing for the economy.

We have been monitoring Lilly and Novo Nordisk for some time, and new clinical results from a recent drug trial give us confidence in the large upside potential for GLP-1s. These results from a Novo Nordisk study showed impressive cardiovascular outcomes for its GLP-1, Wegovy. This study of over 17,000 overweight or obese people with established cardiovascular disease (but without diabetes) showed that Wegovy reduced the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, sudden cardiac death) by over 20% for up to five years. This large and well-controlled trial helps to demonstrate that the weight loss benefits of GLP-1s (likely similar for Mounjaro and Wegovy) lead to better health outcomes for patients and likely save the healthcare system significant amounts of money over the long term. In our view, this makes it very unlikely that payors and governments will deny patient access and reimbursement for these drugs for the long haul (hence the positive stock price moves for Lilly and Novo when the data was released mid-quarter).', 'We have started with a small 1% position in Lilly, but when paired with our new holding in Novo Nordisk at 2% (NVO is slightly larger as its valuation is lower), it represents a 3% combined position in the two companies we expect to maintain a duopoly in this large drug class over the next several years.', 'Novo Nordisk has a long history as the leader in diabetes pharmaceuticals. It is much more narrowly focused on diabetes than Lilly with its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy (Wegovy is the same drug as Ozempic but uses a different name for obesity), driving most of the company’s revenue and earnings growth. The cardiovascular outcomes trial mentioned above is a big positive for Novo. It establishes the duopoly with Lilly in insulin management for Type 2 diabetics and weight loss for the huge number of overweight and obese people across the globe.', 'Novo has more legacy diabetes products that its newer drugs will cannibalize, but our research indicates that we can expect high-teens earnings per share growth from Novo over the next five years.
