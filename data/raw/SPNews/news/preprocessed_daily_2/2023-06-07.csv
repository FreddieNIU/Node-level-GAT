You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth. In this article, we will discuss top dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Top 16 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned the holdings of 943 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked the top 16 dividend stocks which are most popular among these funds as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based company that specializes in financial software. In fiscal Q3 2023, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion during the same period last year. At the end of April 2023, the company had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $2.8 billion last year.Intuit Inc.

Among these hedge funds, Durable Capital Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that mainly provides commercial banking and investing services to its consumers. In May, Raymond James upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $63 price target, highlighting the company's balance sheet and stable net interest margin.On April 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield stands at around 1.92%.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) saw a spike in hedge fund positions in Q1 2023, as 87 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company with an aggregate value of $4 billion, up from 74 in the previous quarter.RiverPark Advisors mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products for a wide range of industries.

These stakes are collectively worth over $5.6 billion.Madison Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has been trading lower since it reported fourth quarter earnings in January. The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare. The claw back payment period goes back to 2011.”12. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that owns grocery and department stores across the country.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based investment bank and financial services company. In April, the company reported that its credit card delinquency rate increased to 1.17%, from 1.15% in March.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth roughly $30 billion.Artisan Partners discussed reasons to invest in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks and was popular among hedge funds in the most recent quarter.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational financial services company that offers investment and commercial banking services to its consumers.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of over $11.7 billion.Fred Alger Management mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

It may sound tempting to build a dividend portfolio made up entirely of high-yielding names, but there are some flaws to such a strategy.Namely, given how common it is for high-yielding stocks to end up becoming yield or value-traps, paper losses can sometimes outweigh the gains from steady-but-large payouts. Hence, placing as much emphasis on factors like quality and dividend growth are key. A portfolio consisting of the best forever hold dividend stocks may have the highest overall yield, yet factors like continued dividend growth, as well as from growth of the portfolio due to price appreciation will more than make up for it.So, what are some of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy right now? Consider these seven. Each one offers a solid yield, has a track record of steady dividend growth, and is reasonably-priced to boot.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGPCGenuine Parts$148.93ITWIllinois Tool Works$218.73JPMJPMorgan$135.71LMTLockheed Martin$444.01LOWLowe’s$201.13MRKMerck$110.41TXNTexas Instruments$173.88Genuine Parts (GPC)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comGenuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a leading distributor of automotive and industrial parts. The company may be best known for its customer-facing NAPA Auto parts brand, and for its longstanding sponsorship of NASCAR.GPC stock, however, may be best known among investors for its status as not only a “dividend aristocrat,” but a “dividend king,” as it has increased its dividend more than fifty years in a row (66 to be exact). At current prices, shares sport a 2.42% forward yield. Over the past five years, GPC has raised its payout by an average of 5.78% annually.Trading for a reasonable 18 times earnings, sell-side forecasts call for the company’s earnings to continue growing in the coming years, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Still, such growth should be sufficient for GPC to sustain (and grow) its valuation, which alongside the dividends could create solid total returns.Story continuesIllinois Tool Works (ITW)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIllinois Tools Works (NYSE:ITW) is many years away from becoming a “dividend king.” However, the industrial conglomerate did attain “dividend aristocrat” status after delivering its 25th consecutive year of dividend growth. ITW stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.33%. Although this doesn’t put it into the “high yield stocks to never sell” category, it is certainly one of the moderate yield stocks to never sell, for two reasons.First, ITW is increasing its payout at a rapid pace. Over the past five years, Illinois Tools Works’ dividend has increased by an average of 11.5% annually. Second, alongside double-digit dividend growth, the company (which prides itself on the effectiveness of its decentralized management structure) has a long history of steady earnings growth, which has resulted in more-than-satisfactory price appreciation for ITW. Shares today trade for 22.3 times earnings.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA few weeks back, I named JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) one of the best Dow stocks. Much of my argument had to do with the money center bank’s big rebound potential, once issues such as the banking crisis and the commercial real estate crisis resolve.JPM stock today trades for around 10.1 times earnings. To many, this valuation may appear more-than-fair, given that other big bank stocks now trade at lower multiples. However, once the issues mentioned above resolve, shares could return to prior multiples (mid-teens). That’s not all.Post-crisis, earnings growth and dividends could mean more outstanding returns ahead for shares. JPM currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.92%. JPMorgan Chase has also raised its payout by nearly 13% annually over the past five years. Taking all of this into account, consider it one of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAdmittedly, after rallying from early 2022 through early 2023, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) shares haven’t performed so hot lately. This defense contracting stock has sold off since April, due to the latest debt ceiling fight between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress.However, as of this writing the current proposed debt ceiling compromise bodes well for defense stocks. At least, that’s the view of Citi analyst Jason Gursky, who on May 30 made this argument, saying that LMT stock and many of its peers will rally if this bill is passed.Much like with JPM, the resolution of overarching uncertainty, coupled with earnings and dividend growth, could mean strong returns ahead for Lockheed Martin shares. LMT has a forward yield of 2.68%, and the company has raised its payout 20 years in a row. Rising geopolitical tensions likely bode well for Lockheed Martin’s future earnings growth.Lowe’s (LOW)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockPreviously, I’ve argued that Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is one of the best buyback stocks. The home improvement retailer is currently in the process of buying back $15 billion worth of its own shares. This equates to around 12.3% of LOW’s current market cap.However, the appeal of LOW stock goes beyond just the company’s share repurchase plans. This is also one of the best long-term dividend stocks. A “dividend king,” with 59 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt, Lowe’s has been aggressive in increasing its payouts in recent years.While currently yielding 2.13% annually, over the past five years, Lowes has implemented annual dividend increases averaging 20.7%. I’m not saying that 20% annual payout increases will continue in perpetuity, but with a payout ratio of just 30.24%, the retailer has room to substantially raise this dividend in the coming years.Merck (MRK)high-yield dividend stocks: a man holding a digital rendering of a bar graph showing increasing valueSource: ShutterstockMerck (NYSE:MRK) is far from reaching “dividend king” status. Even so, don’t underestimate the big pharma company should still be considered one of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy. MRK stock currently has a forward yield of 2.63%. The company’s payouts have grown by an average of 9.41% per year over the past five years. Further earnings and dividend growth may be in store, if analysts earning forecasts are to be believed.Sell-side estimates call for earnings to climb this year and the next. Perhaps, for many more years after that. As InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently argued, Merck has made moves to extend the patent production of its flagship Keytruda cancer treatment. This could result in a long growth runway, creating strong total returns for investors scooping up this stock today.Texas Instruments (TXN)a bag on a table with the word ""dividends"" on it. represent dividend stocks of all time.Source: ShutterstockWhen it comes to chip stocks right now, it’s about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and its high exposure to the artificial intelligence (or AI) megatrend. Yet if you are a dividend investor, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) may make for a better choice.Why? Yes, over the past year, TXN stock has traded sideways, as investors gauge the impact of a near-term weakening in semiconductors for both electronics as well as for industrial use. However, much like many of the other best long-term dividend stocks, shares may be in for a rebound once uncertainties clear up.On a longer time frame, steady earnings and dividend growth could result in strong total returns. Texas Instruments currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.81%. The company has a 17-year track record of consecutive dividend growth, and its payouts have increased by an average of 15.6% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Delighting its shareholders, the company will now pay out a dividend of $1.24 per share, up from the $1.21 paid out in the first quarter. The increased dividend will be paid out on Jul 14, 2023 to shareholders on record as of Jun 30, 2023.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $4.96 per share. This results in an annualized yield of about 4.3%, considering Alexandria’s closing price of $115.43 on Jun 5. For the 12 months ending Jun 30, 2023, the common stock dividend marks an increase of 24 cents or 5% year over year.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust investors, and Alexandria remains committed to that. It has increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.84%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check Alexandria’s dividend history here.Can Alexandria Maintain Its Payout?Alexandria operates life science, agtech and advanced technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. Reflecting robust demand for its high-quality office/laboratory space, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 1.2 million rentable square feet (RSF) of space in the first quarter of 2023. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to 1.1 million RSF.The high demand for Class A properties in AAA locations is aiding the level of occupancy and driving growth in rents. Alexandria registered rental rate growth of 48.3% during the reported quarter. On a cash basis, the rental rate increased 24.2%.Moreover, in the first quarter of 2023, investment-grade or publicly-traded large-cap tenants accounted for 49% of the annual rental revenues in effect. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all tenants is 7.2 years. For Alexandria’s top 20 tenants, it is 9.5 years. This ensures steady rental revenues for ARE.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. The company had $5.3 billion of liquidity at the end of the reported quarter. As of the first-quarter end, ARE had no debt maturities before 2025, and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.4 years.For the five-year period ending Dec 31, 2023, Alexandria expects to generate for reinvestment an aggregate of $1.7 billion of net cash provided by operating activities after dividends.Its funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio remains favorably low at 55% for the three months ended Mar 31, 2023. Looking at the company’s solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.However, reflecting broader market concerns, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 5.7% in the past month compared with the industry’s fall of 1.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Rexford Industrial Realty REXR and EastGroup Properties EGP, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

As nearly every Wall Street analyst was calling for lower stock prices in 2023 (along with an impending recession), it paid to ignore the noise and listen to what the market and individual stocks were telling us.A strategy that is mainly mechanical can free investors from emotional decision-making. Emotions can prevent investors from making sound decisions and are one of our biggest threats to achieving a considerable rate of return on our investments.Rule-based strategies remove the reliance of making decisions based on predictions or guesswork. Investing using a clear set of rules allows investors to follow a disciplined approach. And here at Zacks, we provide our subscribers with a rule-based strategy that has consistently outperformed the market year after year.How to Predict Explosive GainsAt the heart of this strategy is the Zacks Rank, which analyzes earnings estimate revisions. These earnings revisions have been shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices. Only the top 20% of all stocks that are experiencing the most substantial revisions are ranked as either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500. In fact, based on a recent 34-year study, a portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks beat the market with an average annual return of over 25% per year – more than double that of the S&amp;P’s 11.1%.That’s why it is so crucial to keep an eye on which stocks are ranked favorably by the Zacks Rank system. Let’s take a look at a current example in today’s investment climate.A Zacks ‘Strong Buy’ and Consistent Outperformer Unum Group UNM provides financial protection benefits solutions primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland. UNM provides group long-term and short-term disability, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment products. The company also offers cancer and critical illness, dental and vision, group pension, and voluntary life insurance products.Story continuesUNM is ranked as the leading disability income writer and second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. The company sells its products through field sales personnel, independent brokers, consultants, and independent contractor agencies.UNM is part of the Zacks Insurance – Accident and Health industry, which is currently ranked in the top 8% out of approximately 250 industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform over the next 3 to 6 months. Also note the favorable characteristics for this industry below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuantitative research studies have shown that approximately half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. By focusing on the top stocks within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.A History of Earnings Beats and Improving ForecastsUNM has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Last month, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.87/share, a 13.33% surprise over the $1.65 consensus estimate. UNM has delivered a +18.61% average earnings surprise over the last four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn a sign of strength, analysts covering the insurance company have increased their full-year EPS estimates by +11.23% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $7.43/share, reflecting potential growth of 19.7% relative to last year. It’s exactly the type of trend we want to look for when narrowing down our list of potential stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat the Zacks Model Unveils The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) seeks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that this recent information can serve as a more accurate predictor of the future, which can give investors a leg up during earnings season.The technique has proven to be quite useful in finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks delivered a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year backtest.UNM is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and boasts a +1.17% Earnings ESP. Another beat may be in the cards when the company reports its Q2 results.Disclosure: UNM is a holding in the Zacks Income Investor portfolio.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth.

The stock's dividend yield stands at around 1.92%.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) saw a spike in hedge fund positions in Q1 2023, as 87 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company with an aggregate value of $4 billion, up from 74 in the previous quarter.RiverPark Advisors mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13.

The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare. The claw back payment period goes back to 2011.”12. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

A substantial majority, about 80%, of the company's nitrogen output is sold as fertilizer.CF Industries plays a crucial role in global food production through its nitrogen fertilizers, which are essential inputs for modern agriculture. Ammonia is a crucial ingredient in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers. Nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for plant growth. It's an essential component of proteins, enzymes and genetic material in plants. Nitrogen fertilizers boost crop yields by providing the additional nutrients that plants need to grow to their full potential, beyond what they can get from the soil naturally. By providing these products, CF Industries helps farmers around the world produce more food per acre of land.High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioNYSE:CF) reported its latest earnings results for the first quarter of 2023, which included GAAP earnings per share of $2.85, outperforming estimates by $0.40. The company also posted revenue of $2.01 billion, exceeding expectations by $150 million despite a year-over-year decline of 30%. Over the last 12 months, the company brought in net cash from operating activities amounting to $3.41 billion and free cash flow of $2.33 billion.The company used some of this cash to continue its share repurchase program, buying back over 1 million shares for a total of $75 million during the first quarter. Looking back at the last decade, CF Industries has brought its shares down from 277 million to under 195 million. Thus, we can likely expect the trend to continue, adding value for shareholders.The company also announced two strategic developments during the quarter, including the signing of a definitive asset purchase agreement with Incitec Pivot Limited for their ammonia production complex situated in Waggaman, Louisiana. Additionally, CF Industries executed a memorandum of understanding with LOTTE CHEMICAL, a leading chemical company in South Korea. This agreement is for a joint venture to supply clean ammonia in South Korea. The market for Green Ammonia is one of the fastest growing globally and projected to reach $14.5 billion by 2030 according to estimates from Vantage Market Research.Story continuesCorn as a durable competitive advantage The companys sales and profits are significantly influenced by the acreage of corn planted. Corn, unlike soybeans, doesn't naturally produce its own nitrogen, thus necessitating the use of nitrogen fertilizers for maximizing crop yields. Thus, corn-planted acres greatly impact the demand for nitrogen in North America.On the cost side, the risk is that natural gas prices rise as it remains the main ingredient used in nitrogen fertilizer production, accounting for nearly 50% of costs. The global fertilizer market seems to be normalizing, production and prices steadily recovering. However, long-term production will still be essential to its customers as well as the consumer. From a numbers standpoint, this has added up to significant growth and profitability.ValuationThis is a tough company to value because despite record profits, the stock is down 32% over the last 52 weeks, and that includes the August 2022 highs above $117 per share. When stretched out over the long-term, I believe the company will continue to build shareholder value through acquisitions, buybacks and book value growth. That will happen whether the top and bottom lines rise consistently or not.Since 2013, revenues have doubled and the company has booked close to $10 billion in total net profit. The next 10 years should be even better by my estimates, which coupled with a lower share count could mean a substantial increase in share prices. For example, lets say CF Industries can double profits by 2033 (which I believe is feasible) and buys back the same amount of stock (~30%) as the past decade, giving it roughly 140 million shares. With current net income above $3 billion, that would put earnings per share above $40 in a decade. Admittedly, that may seem like a crazy high prediction, but I think the numbers might just add up.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth.

These stakes have a consolidated value of $4.5 billion.15. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based company that specializes in financial software. In fiscal Q3 2023, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion during the same period last year. At the end of April 2023, the company had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $2.8 billion last year.Intuit Inc.

Among these hedge funds, Durable Capital Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that mainly provides commercial banking and investing services to its consumers. In May, Raymond James upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $63 price target, highlighting the company's balance sheet and stable net interest margin.On April 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield stands at around 1.92%.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) saw a spike in hedge fund positions in Q1 2023, as 87 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company with an aggregate value of $4 billion, up from 74 in the previous quarter.RiverPark Advisors mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products for a wide range of industries.

These stakes are collectively worth over $5.6 billion.Madison Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has been trading lower since it reported fourth quarter earnings in January. The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare. The claw back payment period goes back to 2011.”12. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that owns grocery and department stores across the country.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based investment bank and financial services company. In April, the company reported that its credit card delinquency rate increased to 1.17%, from 1.15% in March.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth roughly $30 billion.Artisan Partners discussed reasons to invest in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks and was popular among hedge funds in the most recent quarter.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of over $11.7 billion.Fred Alger Management mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

To skip out on why consumer staples stocks might be relevant right now and their performance this year, head on over to the top 5 Small Cap Consumer Staples Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. As we're about to exit the first half of 2023, a period of significant uncertainty in the stock market is nearly over. The main question on everyone's mind last year was how high will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates in its fight against inflation. This fight saw the bank consecutively increase the rates by 75 basis points for a cumulative five percentage point increase since 2022. This aggressive approach had rattled investors so much last year that even the slightest hint of a raise from any member of the Fed would trigger drops in the stock market.Then, 2023 started out with the worries of a potential default by the U.S. government. However, with that particular threat a thing of the past, the only thing that investors are worried about right now is a potential recession. A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of an economic contraction, and due to the complications involved in gathering data, it is often over before we even know that it took place.Looking at the stock markets, there are several categories of stocks that are generally expected to weather a recessionary storm. One such segment is the consumer defensive or the consumer staples segment. This segment consists of firms that make and sell everyday, general use products such as detergents, food, toothpaste, and soap. The logic behind is that as an economy slows down and incomes drop, while people will cut down discretionary spending such as air travel, but they still have to brush their teeth and take a shower.While this makes intuitive sense, it's also important to look at what the professionals think about consumer staples stocks during an economic downturn. Fortunately for us, there is no shortage of research that analyzes how well the consumer defensive industry performs on the stock market in a recession. One such report comes from Hargreaves Lansdown and it analyses the British FTSE Index. Hargreaves confirms the hypothesis that during a broad stock market downturn, consumer staples do indeed lose much less of their value compared to the broader market. For instance, its data shows that during the peak of the coronavirus's hit to the stock market, the FTSE All Share Index dropped by 29.5% through March 18, 2020. However, during the same period, the consumer staples sector had dropped by less than half or by 13.24%. Talk about cold, hard data.Story continuesOn the small cap consumer staples front, we have two indexes to help us understand how this segment is performing. One index is the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Consumer Staples index, which has returned 4.56% over the year and 4.7% year to date. Another collection of small cap consumer staples stocks is the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF which provides a comfortable way to invest in small cap consumer staples stocks.Another set of data comes from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. This data looks at the short interest in the consumer defensive stocks. Released in April, the report shows that by the end of March, the short interest percentage in consumer staple stocks stood at 3.4% - below the average percentage of 5.6% in 2022. This provides one of the strongest evidence of the market's belief that a recession is due later this year since a higher short interest indicates that more investors expect the share prices of the target companies to drop. Additionally, the S&amp;P also shows that not all consumer defensive stocks are equal. In fact, while the average consumer staple short interest was at 3.4% in March, for the drug companies, this actually jumped to a whopping 9.58%. At the same time, merchandise retailers and distillers have short interest percentages of 1.72% and 2.12%, respectively. Keep these sectors in mind as you go through our list of the top ten consumer staples stocks.Another lucrative aspect of investing in the stock market, apart from potentially watching your money grow while others are losing theirs, is dividends. Well, a lot of consumer staples stocks also pay dividends, like the ones in our list of top dividend paying consumer staple stocks. Some of the top dividend paying stocks are household names such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).On a closing note, let's take a look at what one of the largest consumer staples companies in the world, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) believes is in store for its industry this year. According to its management:These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7.4% reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales.Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year’s elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double-digits in food categories. It’s important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains and grocery continued, including from higher income households as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top small cap consumer staple stock picks of billionaires, out of which some top picks are John B. Sanfilippo &amp; Son, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBSS), Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc. (NYSE:HIMS), and Herbalife Ltd.

JWN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 21, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nordstrom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nordstrom is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 50 cents per share to 44 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nordstrom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(NYSE: DBRG) is a Boca Raton, Florida-based diversified REIT that owns and operates data centers as well as cell towers, digital infrastructure, fiber networks, real estate and other businesses. As of March 31, its platform manages nearly $69 billion of assets on behalf of its limited partners and shareholders. DigitalBridge Group was founded in 2009.DigitalBridge Group has a 52-week range of $9.99 to $23.44. The past 18 months have been difficult for investors as DigitalBridge’s share price has fallen from $34 to a low near $10 in early May. Weaker-than-expected first-quarter funds from operations (FFO) and revenue did not help. But the share price seems to be in recovery mode and year to date, DigitalBridge has a total return of 22.03%.On June 5 Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods analyst Jade Rahmani upgraded DigitalBridge Group from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the target price from $12.50 to $17.50.From its most recent closing price of $12.84, that represents a potential gain of 36%. Earlier in May, RBC Capital Markets reiterated its Outperform rating on DigitalBridge and maintained a $14 price target.Last September, DigitalBridge reinstated a quarterly dividend of $.01 that was eliminated in March 2020.

It was formed in 2017.Story continuesOn June 5, Raymond James Equity Research analyst Buck Horne upgraded Clipper Realty from Market Perform to Outperform and announced a $7 price target. Horne feels the valuation is too attractive to ignore at the current price. From its most recent closing price of $5.69, that represents a potential gain of 23%.Clipper Realty is another REIT that has recently recovered from a long-term poor performance.   The share price had fallen from $9.50 at the start of 2022 to $5 in mid-May. Since then, it has bounced back almost 14%.On May 4, Clipper Realty announced first-quarter adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $0.11, up from $0.10 in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $433.67 million was 3.95% below analysts’ estimates, but 5.05% higher than revenue of $32.05 million in the first quarter of 2022.Clipper Realty pays a quarterly dividend of $0.095 per share. The annual dividend of $0.38 yields 6.67%.Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) is a Chicago-based REIT that owns or is invested in 301 apartment buildings with 79,351 units in large urban areas such as Boston, New York, Washington D.C, Seattle, San Francisco and Denver.

From its most recent closing price of $63.09, that represents a potential gain of 1.4%.On May 31, RBC Capital analyst Brad Heffern maintained an Outperform rating on Equity Residential, while raising his price target from $70 to $71. That represents a potential gain of 12.5%.Equity Residential pays an annual dividend of $2.65, which currently yields 4.3%. The dividend has grown 22.7% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations over that time. Year to date, Equity Residential has a total return of 8.35%.Investors are cautioned to perform their own due diligence on any stock they’re considering for purchase and not to buy a stock just because of an analyst upgrade or increase in price target.  Analysts are only correct about 50% of the time, but it is true that upgrades can increase the share price of a stock over the short term.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

Gasoline inventories also rose more-than-expected at 2.8 million barrels, compared with estimates for a build of 880,000 barrels.The unexpected build in fuel inventories raised concerns over consumption by the world's top oil user, especially as travel demand grew during the Memorial Day weekend.Prices fell earlier in the session on weak Chinese economic data.China's exports shrank much faster than expected in May and imports fell, albeit at a slower pace, as manufacturers struggled to find demand abroad and domestic consumption remained sluggish.Wednesday's data also showed that crude oil imports into China, the world's largest oil importer, rose to their third-highest monthly level in May as refiners built up inventories.A JP Morgan note said forward crude cover in the country has climbed, indicating refiners have not increased processing rates but are instead storing oil.Story continuesAlso, supporting prices, the dollar dipped as chances faded for a Federal Reserve rate hike next week. A weaker greenback helps demand as oil becomes cheaper for foreign buyers.Global economic growth will pick up only moderately over the next year as the full effects of central bank rate hikes are felt, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, the latest to flag the impact of monetary tightening.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston, Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Additional reporting by Yuka Obayashi and Muyu Xu; Editing by David Goodman, Mark Potter, Bernadette Baum and Sharon Singleton)]"

Imports also fell, signaling weak economic trends in the world's largest oil importer.The readings added to recent data that pointed to a slowdown in China's post-COVID economic recovery, which further undermined bets that China will drive oil demand to record highs this year.Brent oil futures fell 0.4% to $76.00 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.3% to $71.49 a barrel by 23:37 ET (03:37 GMT). Both contracts settled around 0.6% lower on Tuesday after a volatile session.Crude prices had rallied as much as 3% at the beginning of the week, after Saudi Arabia pledged more production cuts in July. But they later reversed all early gains following a string of weak economic readings.Other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+), particularly Russia, also appeared to be keeping production steady.Still, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that oil markets will tighten in the second half of the year as supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and the OPEC+ go into effect, somewhat supporting prices. The agency expects Brent to trend just below $80 by end-2023.Oil markets took mixed cues from industry data showing that U.S. crude inventories shrank more than expected in the prior week, as summer season demand heats up. But signs of an unexpected build in gasoline and distillate inventories raised questions over just how much fuel demand was improving, given that U.S. economic activity appeared to be cooling.Other weak economic readings continued to pile in. Data on Wednesday showed that Australia’s economy barely grew in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesThis came after data earlier this week showed that U.S. service sector growth slowed substantially in May, while German factory orders contracted through April.Fears of a global recession, which could stymie oil demand this year, have kept oil prices depressed despite multiple efforts from the OPEC to reduce supply and improve prices.Related ArticlesOil pulled lower by weak Chinese data, wipes out OPEC-driven gainsGold treads water amid Fed uncertainty, copper extends reboundSaudi crown prince, US Secretary of State discuss bilateral ties]"

With new infrastructure investments taking 3-5 years before yielding significant output, supply could be strained for several years going forward.Fundamental CatalystsESG, which stands for environment, social, and corporate governance is a recent business framework popularizing the ideas of environmental and social consideration of business actions. While fundamentally a pragmatic and forward-thinking institution, it has distorted investment activity over the last few years.Money that may have gone to oil and gas investments that were instead redirected to renewable energy efforts have unfortunately not been as fruitful as previously hoped. The stark reality of the situation is that most alternative energy efforts still have limited upside economic opportunity.OPEC+ over the last few months has made it abundantly clear that they will be cutting production and defending the price of oil. Just last week the organization announced that they will be cutting daily production by 1 million barrels per day, which is in addition to already announced cuts from earlier this year.  The early 2000s were marked by tremendous growth rates, driven heavily by China. This booming international economy pushed demand for oil to new highs, and thus new highs for the price of oil. Energy companies excitedly reinvested $100s of billions of profits into new drilling, extraction, and pipelines to meet this new demand.However, 2008 would hit like a ton of bricks, and slam the global economy to a near halt. Oil prices collapsed from $140 to $40 and suddenly, these new energy infrastructure investments were pointless. There was a huge correction in the energy industry and most companies didn’t survive.Story continuesThis cycle traumatized a generation of energy investors and has left oil and gas companies understandably hoarding profits, rather than reinvesting. It didn’t help that the last decade demonized oil and gas, and vehemently encouraged investment in alternative energy sources.The technical picture of oil prices defines a compelling structure, and path for oil prices going forward. After consolidating for more than a year, and putting in a double bottom in May, the chart is beginning to look conducive again for a move higher.$74 remains a near-term level of resistance, and $82 a major level of resistance. Above those levels and it’s off to the races for oil.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewEnergy CompaniesInstead of buying the commodity outright, investing in energy companies is another way to play this investment trend. The Zacks Rank #1 list has identified a number of compelling oil stocks to consider.Sunoco SUN, Weatherford International WFRD, and Seadrill Limited SDRL are three stocks with upward trending earnings revisions.

This, in turn, is likely to enable the A2A payment solution to support the seamless processing of a significant number of financial transactions as well as infuse higher security within the transactions.The solution, which will be devised considering the evolving needs of consumers, also aims to improve the payment experience for UAE merchants.The latest move reflects Mastercard’s continuous efforts to strengthen its footprint as a leading provider of innovative payment solutions across the globe, for which it has frequently resorted to the help of fintechs. Such partnerships enable MA to capture a significant share of the booming digital payments market of the UAE and broadly, throughout the MENA region.Also, the collaboration with Dapi reflects a time-opportune move on the part of Mastercard, considering the widespread benefits provided by A2A payments and the open banking industry.A2A payments, which are transferred directly from the bank account of a consumer to a merchant’s account devoid of any intermediary’s need, lower the cost of payment acceptance for merchants. It also settles funds in near real time and boosts the cash flow of merchants. Additionally, consumers benefit from a speedy, safe and seamless checkout experience on selecting A2A payments.Therefore, the latest tie-up bears testament to Mastercard’s sincere efforts in integrating hassle-free A2A payments and subsequently, infuse greater digitization within the everyday lives of consumers.Mastercard boasts a solid presence in the open banking industry, that puts intensified focus on bringing about an innovative financial landscape and an accelerated digital transformation journey across different parts of the globe.Story continuesIn fact, Dapi’s open banking capabilities received an impetus with the opportunity to be a part of the inaugural cohort of the Mastercard Start Path Open Banking program last year.  Thereafter, the well-known open banking expertise of Mastercard and the opportunity to work together with the tech giant’s worldwide ecosystem of banks, merchants, partners, and digital players imparted the ability to Dapi to devise advanced open banking solutions for the MENA region and further.Shares of Mastercard have gained 6.5% year to date, compared with the industry’s 6% growth.  MA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are SPX Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE: FE) and its transmission subsidiaries have completed annual inspections and maintenance of their high-voltage power lines and equipment in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""The transmission system delivers power from generation sources to local substations and lines serving homes and businesses, acting as the interstate highway system of the electric grid,"" said Carl Bridenbaugh, vice president of transmission at FirstEnergy. ""Coupled with similar work at the local utility level, the preparations help ensure power is reliable as customer demand rises along with the summer heat.""Helicopter patrols have been completed along nearly 18,000 miles of high-voltage lines across FirstEnergy's service territory, with personnel examining the wires, equipment and structures for potential maintenance issues. The helicopters fly at speeds of approximately 25 to 35 miles per hour while an onboard observer looks for any conditions that may require repair, sometimes hovering along the lines to get a closer look. The aerial patrols, which are completed each year, started in January and wrapped up in mid-May.The company also conducted inspections on more than 4,700 miles of its transmission lines in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey using special ultraviolet and infrared (UV/IR) camera equipment mounted on the bottom of the helicopters. An onboard thermographer uses the camera to view the electrical equipment through infrared and ultraviolet spectrums. The thermal images can identify equipment issues such as loose connections, corrosion and load imbalances, while ultraviolet technology detects electrical discharge along a power line caused by issues such as rusted hardware and cracked insulators.Story continuesAny issues identified during the inspections are addressed to prevent service disruptions and costly repairs down the road. FirstEnergy conducts UV/IR inspections on a four-year cycle, meaning it will inspect all transmission lines over a four-year period.In addition to equipment inspections and maintenance, transmission vegetation management crews have been trimming trees along nearly 1,280 of the approximately 3,300 miles of high-voltage lines planned this year as part of its $80 million transmission vegetation management program. This work is crucial to protecting the electric grid from tree-related outages during severe weather.Beyond the infrastructure work, FirstEnergy personnel performed an analysis of projected peak power flows to help ensure the grid is prepared for increased electricity demand this summer.The summer preparation work builds on extensive investments into the transmission system through Energizing the Future, FirstEnergy's multi-year modernization initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features. Through 2022, FirstEnergy has invested more than $10 billion in the Energizing the Future initiative.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

(NYSE: FE) subsidiary Ohio Edison is proactively working with local municipalities to keep roads along the lakeshore safe by temporarily turning off streetlights to deter swarms of the insects. Mayflies are attracted to streetlights and can create hazardous driving conditions when large numbers accumulate along roads and bridges near the lights.Ohio Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The annual emergence of the mayflies typically comes in late June and can last until September. In preparation for their arrival, Ohio Edison has started to suspend streetlight service along several roads in Port Clinton and will continue doing so in other nearby communities over the next few weeks. The company will resume streetlight service once the hatching season ends.Because the mayfly population has spiked along Lake Erie over the past decade, Ohio Edison partners with these lakeshore communities each summer to keep motorists and bikers safe during the mayfly season.""Many people don't realize mayflies create a safety issue because their carcasses contain an oily substance that makes the surfaces they coat very slick, especially when it rains,"" said Nick Katsaros, an external affairs consultant in FirstEnergy's Lake Erie service area. ""By turning off the streetlights near the lake over the next few months, we can help dissuade thousands, even millions, of mayflies from congregating near them.""Mayflies start their lives deep in the mud of Lake Erie and are especially sensitive to depleted oxygen levels. When the insects emerge from the water as adults, they live between 24 and 72 hours, which is why their hatching season is short.""We realize our streetlight service is very important to the communities we serve, and their safety is always our top priority,"" said Katsaros. ""We look forward to resuming streetlight service in the impacted areas once it is safe to do so.""Story continuesPedestrians and bikers are reminded to use extra caution when traveling along unlit roads this summer. They are urged to always use sidewalks and crosswalks and wear bright clothing or flashing devices to alert drivers of their presence. Drivers are reminded to reduce their speed in unlit areas and be on the lookout for people walking or biking in the area.If a customer notices a streetlight or outdoor area light is out in their community unintentionally, they are encouraged to report it to Ohio Edison online at www.firstenergycorp.com/lightingproblem or by calling 1-800-633-4766.Ohio Edison serves more than 1 million customers across 34 Ohio counties.

Kelman has previously served as CMO at Amazon Web Services and Oracle.Kendall Collins, who will step into the role of chief of staff for Benioff, had worked as CMO at Okta and Cisco's AppDynamics.Salesforce President and Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham would be assuming new duties such as marketing, employee success and business technology, the source said.Salesforce did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the appointments.News website Insider, which first reported the moves citing a memo earlier in the day, suggested that Millham's new role positions him as a top contender to succeed Benioff as his successor.The appointments at Salesforce come amid mounting pressure from activist investors, including ValueAct, Inclusive Capital, and Starboard Value, who have been advocating for operational improvements, cost-control initiatives, and enhanced efficiencies over the past several months.Earlier this year, Salesforce announced plans to close some offices and cut jobs by 10% after the pandemic-induced hiring left the company with a bloated workforce.Growth at major cloud players from Microsoft Corp to Amazon.com Inc has come under pressure this year as businesses undertake belt-tightening measures to weather the impact of rising interest rates and a potential economic slowdown.(Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh and Akriti Sharma in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)]"

For each day an employee comes into the office from June 12 to June 23, the company will donate $10 to a local charity.""Coming together for our culture, customers, and community is what we do best,"" the senior executive wrote.The initiative is classic Salesforce, which has touted a self-proclaimed Ohana culture, another way of saying, “We’re not just colleagues, we’re family.” Some have pondered whether Salesforce's Ohana culture died after mass layoffs rocked the company, followed by cuts to things like the company's gratitude bonus for employees and a mandated return to office for certain groups of employees (after CEO Marc Benioff accused pandemic hires of ""low productivity"").Despite the slow march forward on return to office, Salesforce does allow for remote work at managers' discretion and based on the team. The new initiative also allows for remote workers to participate. When a remote worker attends a virtual event, the company will donate $10 on their behalf.The company hopes to raise more than $1 million through this initiative, with a maximum donation of $2.5 million, according to the senior executive’s message and internal documents viewed by Fortune. Staff are able to vote for their favorite local charities for the next two days.A Salesforce representative told Fortune that ""giving back is deeply embedded in everything we do, and we're proud to introduce Connect for Good to encourage employees to help raise $1 million for local nonprofits.""Once the fundraising event ends, the company will tally up aggregate badge data based on location to inform the donation amount, telling staff that “the data doesn't tell us who went in to the office, how long they stayed, or how many times they badged in and out, just the total number."" Whatever the total number is, Salesforce will multiply it by $10 and donate that amount to the charity with the highest number of employee votes.Story continues""By showing up in the office (or for events), you're strengthening connections and creating a positive wave of change in your community,"" the senior executive wrote.

Smith Corporation AOS have gained 19.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s 2.1% growth. The upside is primarily due to robust North American boiler and water treatment sales. Impressive returns to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also expected to have boosted its shares. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA. O. Smith is benefiting from robust demand for commercial and residential boilers and water treatment products within the North America segment. Price increases are driving the segment’s revenues. AOS expects North American boiler sales to increase mid-single digits year over year, whereas North American water treatment sales are estimated to increase 5-7% year over year. Strong demand for water heating and water treating products in India is also aiding A. O. Smith.A. O. Smith’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first quarter, AOS paid dividends of $45.4 million, up 2.7% year over year. It also repurchased 0.8 million shares for $53.1 million in the same period. Approximately 7.1 million shares are yet to be repurchased under the existing share repurchase authorization.For 2023, A. O. Smith expects to repurchase shares worth approximately $300 million. In January 2023, the company’s board boosted the existing share buyback program by authorizing to repurchase an additional 7.5 million shares.Will the Uptrend in Shares Last?Persistent weakness in the Rest of the Word segment due to lower consumer demand in China as a result of coronavirus-related headwinds is likely to be a drag on A. O. Smith’s performance. A slowdown in the manufacturing sector and recessionary fears signal uncertainties for all industrial companies, and AOS is no exception.Amid demand softness and a general weakness in the economy, A. O. Smith has provided a conservative outlook for 2023. The company expects sales to either increase or decrease by up to 2%. It expects residential water heater industry volumes to be approximately flat year over year.

Ralph Lauren crushed its Q4 EPS estimates by 38% at $0.90 per share compared to expectations of $0.65 a share.  Attributed to Asia revenue jumping 13% year over year to $390 million, Ralph Lauren was able to beat top line estimates by 5% with total sales for Q4 coming in at $1.54 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverall, Ralph Lauren posted strong quarterly growth as earnings climbed 83% YoY with sales up 1% from the prior-year quarter. With that being said the premium footwear and apparel leader does anticipate its operating environment will still be somewhat challenging in the upcoming quarter with the potential of slowing sales.Still, Ralph Lauren’s earnings are now forecasted to rise 12% in its current fiscal 2024 and jump another 13% in FY25 at $10.62 per share. Sales are expected to be up 2% in FY24 and rise another 6% in FY25 to $7.01 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLululemon Q1 ReviewIntriguingly, Lululemon easily surpassed its fiscal first-quarter earnings last Thursday with Q1 EPS coming in at $2.28 and 16% above expectations of $1.97 a share. Lululemon’s strong quarter was also driven by Asia with the company stating its Greater China revenue soared 79% YoY.  Stronger revenue from China led to Lululemon surpassing total sales estimates for Q1 by 4% at $2 billion. Even better was Lululemon’s quarterly growth with earnings jumping 54% from a year ago and sales up 24%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat made Lululemon’s strong quarter more intriguing was the company issuing better-than-expected guidance.

51,9beec4e7-603b-3b06-bb18-a22df5fbdae1,ALGN,2023-06-07,"Insiders Pour Millions Into These 2 Stocks, Morgan Stanley Says They Have up to 140% Upside — Here’s Why You Should Pay Attention",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-pour-millions-2-stocks-000640934.html,1686096400,STORY,"['MS', 'MTCH', 'ALGN']","[Legendary investor Peter Lynch has a straightforward perspective on corporate insiders and their actions in the stock market. He put it simply: insiders may sell shares for a range of reasons, but they only buy shares when they believe the price is going to rise.Keeping a close watch on insiders’ stock purchases can prove to be a profitable investment strategy. Corporate insiders, which include company officers and board members, possess valuable knowledge about company policies and performance that can influence stock prices. They can utilize this information to make informed decisions when purchasing stocks, but they are required by law to publicly disclose their own stock holdings. This transparency allows the general public to gain insights from these purchases.Bearing this in mind, we used the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool from TipRanks to point us in the direction of two stocks flashing signs of strong insider buying, which warrant a closer look. Furthermore, these stocks are receiving strong approval from the analysts at banking giant Morgan Stanley, and offer up to 140% upside potential. Let’s take a closer look.Match Group (MTCH)The first stock we’re looking at is Match Group, the parent firm and holding company of some of the most active dating sites in the online world. Match Group is the owner of Tinder, OKCupid, and match.com – as well as nine other popular and niche online matching sites. The company has been in the business for over twenty years, and boasts that 65% of all LGBT+ couples can trace their relationships to a Match Group site.That’s not too surprising since Match Group specializes in niche dating sites. The company has built its overall success and longevity on the scale of its operations and the breadth of its reach. The firm’s apps have tallied over 750 million downloads, and the products are available in 40 languages. With 40% of all new relationships in the US starting online, Match is solidly positioned for a strong future.Story continuesFor now, the company is reporting some mixed results. In the last reported quarter, 1Q23, Match reported a top line of $787.12 million in total revenue. This was down 1.5% year-over-year and missed the analyst forecast by just under $7 million. The company takes in money globally, and so also reports revenue on a foreign exchange neutral, FXN, basis; by this metric, the top line was $822, and was up 3% y/y.At the bottom line, Match saw 42 cents in earnings per diluted share. This EPS number was down from 60 cents in the year-ago quarter, but beat the current quarter estimates by 2 cents.Turning to the insiders, we find company CEO Bernard Kim showing his confidence in MTCH with a purchase of 31,439 shares. This cost him over $1.08 million in a non-open market buy; Kim now holds a stake in the company worth $2.5 million.Kim may have been bullish, but he’s not the only bull on Match Group. Morgan Stanley analyst Lauren Schenk has also given an upbeat outlook on MTCH shares, writing: “Given the encouraging April update (Tinder revenue reaccelerating, downloads improving, new user growth improving), we continue to have conviction in our out of consensus call that Tinder can reaccelerate revenue growth to double-digits or better by year-end. There is a lot of runway, and thus uncertainty, between now and then but for now our thesis remains largely on track and at 11xFY23 EBITDA, our refreshed sum of the parts analysis implies the market is paying ~12x for Tinder which we believe is a compelling entry point for a 45-50% margin business even if Tinder only delivers 10-12% revenue growth going forward.”Schenk goes on to give MTCH stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, with a $95 price target to suggest a robust 140% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Schenk’s track record, click here)Overall, MTCH gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s analyst consensus, based on 21 recent analyst reviews that include 15 Buys against 6 Holds. The shares are selling for $39.72 and the average price target of $53.42 implies a one-year gain of ~34%. (See MTCH stock forecast)Align Tech (ALGN)We started with a stalwart of the online dating realm – but it’s always easier to find a date when you have a great smile, and the next stock, Align Tech, can help with that. Align works with both high tech and orthodontics; the company’s chief product is a clear orthodontic aligner used to straighten teeth. The company uses a line of high-end 3D scanners to manufacture its proprietary Invisalign product.Align got its start back in the 1990s, and Invisalign was first approved for use in 1998. The company has grown to become a $23 billion giant in the last 25 years, and employs over 24,000 people globally. Align saw $3.8 billion in total revenue last year, and boasts some 15.1 million Invisalign patients since the product first hit the markets.The current year started with both the top and bottom lines better than the analysts had expected. The 1Q23 revenue of $943.1 million beat expectations by $39.9 million, while the non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.25 exceeded the consensus by 13 cents. However, the company’s case volume in 1Q23 of 575.4K slipped by 1% compared to 4Q22.On a positive note, Align’s Clear Aligner revenue, its chief revenue driver, grew 8% quarter-over-quarter, despite the 1% slip in case volume. The company believes that increasing customer confidence, and the post-COVID easing of restrictions in China, will bring stability to the target market. Align is guiding toward 2Q23 revenue in the range of $980 million to $1 billion.Notably, Kevin Dallas, a member of the firm’s Board of Directors, made a significant insider purchase last week. Dallas demonstrated his confidence in the company by investing nearly $2 million to acquire 7,000 shares of the stock. As a result, his total holdings of ALGN now amount to approximately $3.7 million.Morgan Stanley’s 5-star analyst Erin Wright is also taking a bullish stance on Align. She writes of the company: “Our longer term thesis for ALGN remains, where its leadership positioning in an attractive, highly underpenetrated market, along with rising adoption of digital workflows should support +DD earnings growth LT. All in, with its shares now trading at 35.8x our 2024e EPS, at parity with its closest competitor Straumann, we do not believe its current valuation fully reflects its longer term growth prospects.”Wright’s comments back up her Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, and her price target of $383 implies a solid upside of 26% out to the one-year horizon. (To watch Wright’s track record, click here)Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. Align’s 7 recent analyst reviews break down to 5 Buys and 1 Hold and Sell each; the stock’s $349.33 average price target and $304.68 trading price suggests ~15% one-year upside potential.

52,583d44f0-a9ef-333b-b583-c9fd11cf4441,MSFT,2023-06-07,12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-hot-stocks-buy-according-121521749.html,1686140121,STORY,"['META', 'CRM', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'NOW', 'AAPL', 'MU', 'TSM', 'CRWD', 'TSLA']","[In this article we present the list of 12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are some of the hottest stocks on the market this year, which is likely of little surprise to their bullish hedge fund shareholders, which own each of them in significant quantities.Stocks are off to a strong start in 2023 as they look to rebound from an underwhelming 2021 and an even poorer 2022. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has gained 11.9% this year on the heels of 19.5% losses in 2022, while the NYSE is up a more modest 1.3% after 11.5% losses last year. The biggest winners though have been tech stocks, as the Nasdaq has soared by 26.9% year-to-date following a 33.1% decline in 2022.That’s left no shortage of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, with several of their top 10 most popular stocks all delivering big returns this year, while the majority of stocks on this last, all of which have gained at least 30% in 2023, rank among their 30 most popular stocks. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks occupy most of the spots on this list, with AI being a key theme that is driving many of their results to new heights or expanding their capabilities in exciting ways.To determine which hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, you first need to know how to find out what hedge funds are buying. Insider Monkey specializes in exactly that, publishing dozens of articles quarterly on the latest hedge fund activity according to their most recent 13F filings with the SEC, in which hedge funds with more than $500 million in assets under management must disclose their holdings.Insider Monkey also compiles the quarterly ownership data from a select group of 900+ top performing funds to create industry and other theme-specific lists of what stocks hedge funds are buying now, so investors can get a quick snapshot into how some of the brightest minds in the investment world feel about the prospects of companies compared to their rivals in various industries and sectors.Story continuesCritics sometimes point to the fact that any list of the hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is already outdated by the time their holdings data becomes available, given that most hedge funds don’t disclose their holdings until the 13F filing deadline approximately six weeks after the date on which they’re reporting their holdings. However, given their general focus on long-term investing, this criticism is relatively unwarranted and makes them the ideal investors to piggyback for anyone who’s looking to build a portfolio of diversified assets with great long-term potential.That’s not to say we don’t see significant swings in hedge fund ownership of certain stocks each quarter, as just a single event or earnings report can dramatically alter the long-term outlook for companies. In other cases, some of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds see slight declines in ownership in the following quarter(s) simply because they’ve been doing so well and may have reached a valuation point that has surpassed the fair value estimates that some funds have on those stocks.With all of that in mind, let’s check out 12 hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, which have enriched their shareholders with at least 30% returns this year.12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following list of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment and include only the most popular stocks among hedge funds which have posted at least 30% gains year-to-date. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 102 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 32.3% Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are a few of the hottest stocks buy according to hedge funds, who own large stakes in all of those high-performing stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is another hot stock hedge funds love, having hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership during Q1, topping 100 for the first time. The number of smart money TSM shareholders has more than doubled over the last four years. Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital and Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital were among the funds to add TSM to their 13F portfolios during Q1.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the first of several semiconductor stocks to make the list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds thanks to its dominant position in the high-performance chip market, where it currently controls close to a 90% share of the global market. As the demand for top-of-the-line chips intensifies in the coming years thanks to the expected robust growth in AI and cloud computing applications, Taiwan Semiconductor appears poised to continue its impressive growth and further grow its already-strong margins.Wedgewood Partners likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s long-term growth outlook, as relayed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”11. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 73 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 34.5% Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have rallied this year after a miserable 2022 that saw them lose 46% of their value. While they still have a ways to go to make up all of those losses, their 38.2% gains year-to-date have convinced several hedge funds to go long MU, including Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, which bought nearly 4.3 million MU shares in Q1.Despite recently being banned in China when it comes to certain critical infrastructure projects and installations, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have outperformed even TSM’s this year, gaining 35% year-to-date. According to Bernstein analyst Mark Li, the impact of the China ban should be relatively negligible for Micron in the grand scheme of things, as Micron’s enterprise segment accounts just 20% of overall revenue, with China’s portion of that likely accounting for as little as 2% of overall revenue.Claret Asset Management noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares had lost nearly half their value through the first nine months of 2022 in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 289 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 40.2% Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most popular stock among hedge funds in terms of single-ticker ownership (Alphabet has more hedge fund shareholders combined between its two tickers) and it hasn’t disappointed smart money managers this year, returning 36% year-to-date. Unsurprisingly, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, is the largest MSFT shareholder with 39.3 million shares. Its 13F portfolio has 31% exposure to Microsoft.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is taking some intriguing steps to eat into Google’s search dominance, having recently integrated its own search engine Bing into the AI chatbot ChatGPT, a move that was facilitated by Microsoft’s earlier $13 billion investment in the AI platform’s creators, OpenAI. The tech giant is also gaining a strong foothold in the cloud computing space, as Azure is slowing gaining market share on Amazon’s AWS.Alger Spectra Fund discussed the latest AI innovations at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services. Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows Devices, Gaming, and Search). While the company reported decent fiscal second quarter results, their investment in OpenAl’s ChatGPT captured the attention of investors. Contributing to positive performance. Throughout the quarter. Microsoft surprised investors with continual rollouts of new Al capabilities across the company’s portfolio (e.g., Bing, GitHub. Teams, Office 365). Furthermore, the company announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which leverages GPT-4, a large language model, combined with the Microsoft Graph of data to provide Al virtual assistance. We believe Microsoft’s investment in OpenAl provides a first-mover advantage in the Al transformer model space. Despite challenges in the early days of Al-powered applications, the pace of Al innovation is faster than any other enterprise technology previously observed, in our view.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOGL)/155 (GOOG) Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 41.2% Hedge fund ownership of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) peaked at the end of 2021 with nearly 400 long positions in the company’s class A and class C shares being held by hedge funds (some of which owned both classes). That was followed by a 6.9% drop in ownership during the first-half of 2022 and another slight dip in the first quarter of this year.Considering the broad questions facing the long-term viability of Google Search in the age of AI, as outlined in the Microsoft writeup above, it’s perhaps somewhat surprising to see Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares up 41% this year. That said, the effect of ChatGPT/Bing on Google Search’s market share has been negligible thus far. In fact, Google’s market share rose by 20 basis points to 92.8% in April compared to December 2022, when ChatGPT was first unleashed. And while Search undoubtedly remains the company’s bread-and-butter when it comes to ad revenue, it also has a strong cloud division that grew revenue by 28% in Q1, while YouTube remains the world’s dominant streaming platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users.The Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy detailed why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of its strongest Q1 performers in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft and Booking Holdings, all of which posted double-digit gains. Shares of media and technology giant Alphabet outperformed as the company announced expense discipline while continuing to invest in its core products of Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.”8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 96 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 44.4% Shares of SaaS workflow platform operator ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) have shot up by 38% in 2023 as the company continues to grow its business at an impressive rate. Hedge funds may be getting concerned about the stock’s valuation, as their ownership of NOW has ticked down slightly for three straight quarters, but it nonetheless remains one of the 30 most popular holdings among smart money managers.ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also turning to AI to bolster the digital transformation suite of services that it offers clients, including recently launching an AI collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the hottest stocks on the planet in 2023 (look for it in the second half of this article). The company will use Nvidia’s software to train its own proprietary AI algorithms in how to better manage workflows and disrupt bottlenecks. ServiceNow is also well on the path to profitability, which has investors excited about the stock’s near-term and longer-term outlook.The Polen Global Growth Strategy believes ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) can grow free cash flow at a greater than 20% annualized rate over the next three-to-five years, which it outlined in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 131 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 46.8% Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another prominent tech company that’s rallied in 2023, gaining over 38%. That’s great news for investing icon Warren Buffett, whose 13F portfolio has unprecedented exposure to the mobile tech giant at 46.4% as of March 13. Overall, there was a slight drop in hedge fund ownership of Apple during Q1.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares slumped by 27% in 2022 but have quickly made up those losses this year, having pushed back near their all-time highs. While the iPhone still accounts for over 50% of Apple’s revenue, its higher-margin services segment continues to grow at an accelerated rate, hitting $20.9 billion in revenue during the company’s fiscal Q2 of 2023. That robust services segment also gives Apple an impressively high moat, as it keeps customers insulated within its own ecosystem, which is undoubtedly why Buffett is such a fan of the company.RiverPark Large Growth Fund believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is still one of the most innovative and well-positioned mobile tech companies in the world, as it divulged in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were our final top contributor for the quarter. While the company reported a rare quarterly earnings miss, investors had expected slower sales due to macro headwinds. Services continue to be a bright spot for the company with an all-time high of $21 billion in quarterly revenue, a 6% year-over-year increase, and management expects iPhone revenue growth to re-accelerate in 2Q. Operating Cash Flow was $34 billion for the quarter, and the company returned $23 billion to shareholders in the last three months, including $4 billion in dividends and $19 billion in share repurchases.With an installed base of 2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment (now 18% of revenue), we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best-positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”6. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 49.2% There was a 25% drop in hedge fund ownership of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) during the final quarter of 2022 as investors worried about weakening demand for the company’s cybersecurity offerings. There was a slight 9% rebound in hedge fund positions in Q1, during which Crowdstrike posted promising Q4 results and boasted a record Q1 pipeline.Closing out the first half of our list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), yet another company that has been successfully using AI, in this case to bolster the speed and efficiency of its cybersecurity solutions. CrowdStrike’s extensible platform has clearly struck a positive note with the majority of its clients, over 60% of which use at least five of the company’s modules. CrowdStrike isn’t overly profitable yet, but it is beginning to generate more free cash flow, a figure which could top $1 billion in the company’s current fiscal year.Artisan Developing World Fund discussed CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)’s latest financial results in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included graphics semiconductor company Nvidia, Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Sea, Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre, online travel marketplace Airbnb, and endpoint security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.” Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have performed even better than the aforementioned seven stocks this year, and are also highly regarded by world-class hedge funds.

53,4bb07b32-df6c-30c9-a1bb-6b224de7cadd,MSFT,2023-06-07,10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-popular-stocks-robinhood-120928913.html,1686139768,STORY,"['F', 'MSFT', 'HOOD', 'DIS', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'NIO', 'AAPL']","[In this article we present the list of 10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are a few of the most popular stocks on Robinhood that have delivered strong returns for the platform’s users since the end of 2020.The Robinhood app has been a game changer for retail investors, allowing them to quickly and easily trade stocks and build a portfolio of assets while avoiding the hefty fees that have traditionally plagued the investment space.In place of charging users fees on their trades, Robinhood utilizes a process called payment for order flow, which directs all of the app’s trades through larger entities which can then leverage the power of their increased order sizes to receive more favorable trades. In return, those entities pay a small fee to Robinhood for the use of their trades, the volumes of which can be significant when it comes to the most popular stocks on Robinhood.The app skyrocketed to popularity during the pandemic, nearly tripling in size from 4.3 million monthly active users in 2019 to 11.7 million a year later. There was another seismic jump to 17.3 million MAUs in 2021 during the height of the meme stock craze, which Robinhood played a noteworthy role in. However, activity on the platform has fell substantially in 2022, declining back to 11.4 million MAUs, though the number of funded accounts inched up to a new high of 23 million.Robinhood clearly appeals to a younger user base that wants to dip its toes into stock trading but doesn’t have the assets or wherewithal to invest tens of thousands of dollar with brokerage firms like Charles Schwab. The average user account value on Robinhood was just $4,000 in 2021, compared to $234,000 in Charles Schwab’s case.Given its users’ penchant for small positions and bets on riskier growth stocks, it’s worth looking into the best penny stocks on Robinhood to see which under-the-radar stocks the platform’s users have identified as potential gems. Given that one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood is a cannabis stock, it’s unsurprising that several cannabis-based companies also feature prominently among the best  penny stocks on Robinhood according to its users, including Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NASDAQ:ACB) and Jupiter Wellness, Inc. (NASDAQ:JUPW).Story continuesOn the other end of the spectrum, the most popular stocks on Robinhood feature several of the best stocks to invest in 2023 according to hedge funds and analysts alike, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) (the most popular stock among Robinhood users), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).When it comes to the performance of Robinhood users’ most popular stocks, it’s been quite a mixed bag as you’ll see in the below results. Five of the ten stocks have been big winners for Robinhood investors, while the other five have been losers, four of them being significant losers, with losses in excess of 23% dating back to January 1, 2021.Read on for all the details about the 10 most popular stocks on Robinhood and how they’ve performed for their bullish retail investors over the past two-and-a-half years.10 Most Popular Stocks on RobinhoodWAYHOME studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo compile the following list of Robinhood most popular stocks, we analyzed the top holdings among Robinhood’s users as of the beginning of each quarter during 2021, as well as their top holdings at the beginning of 2022 and the current top holdings on the platform. We then took the top 10 holdings from each of those six periods and assigned them a points value: ten points for first place, nine for second, and so on, down to one point for tenth.Finally, we added up the points to create a final list of the top ten most popular stocks on Robinhood over the past two-and-a-half years. We have ranked and ordered those ten stocks based on their stock performance since January 1, 2021 to determine which popular Robinhood stocks delivered the biggest returns for the platform’s users.Unlike the Robinhood Investor Index, which trails the market since its inception, Insider Monkey has developed several easy-to-follow, market-beating investment strategies. We follow a select group of hedge funds because our leading independent research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns over the long-term.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood10. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 6th (19 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -84.4% Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of most popular stocks on Robinhood that turned out to be good investments for the platform’s users.On the opposite end of the spectrum is NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), which has been nothing short of a disaster for Robinhood investors, losing 84.4% of its value since the end of 2020. Nonetheless, it remains one of their top 10 holdings to this day. On the other hand, numerous hedge funds were cutting their losses and abandoning their NIO long positions in Q1, as there was a 38% decline in smart money ownership of NIO.Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the most prominent funds to sell off its NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stake during Q1, one of 12 stocks the influential money manager is selling in 2023.While NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) still has intriguing long-term prospects in the EV space, having now expanded its deliveries into Europe, the company has been plagued by supply chain and production problems that have crushed the stock in the near term. The company’s also facing increasing EV competition in its Chinese home market. While 2023 deliveries are up by 22% year-over-year through April, they’ve been sliding in the wrong direction on a monthly basis and are about to come up against tougher comps.9. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 5 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 5th (27 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -69.4% SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) was also one of the 5 Meme Stocks Redditors are Buying in April of 2022. Unfortunately for both Redditors and Robinhooders alike, the Canadian pot stock has destroyed the value of their investments in a puff of smoke, losing 69% of its value since the end of 2020. Just five hedge funds were long SNDL on March 31, down from seven a quarter earlier and the lowest total since the final quarter of 2020.SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s struggles are by no means unique among Canadian cannabis companies, which have majorly failed to live up to expectations. The legal Canadian cannabis market simply hasn’t developed anywhere near the extent that was anticipated for a variety of reasons, including consumer dissatisfaction about the quality and cost of legal pot. Industry sales were just $3.7 billion in the first ten months of 2022 according to StatsCan, well below earlier projections that had the industry raking in $7 billion annually by this point.SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) has attempted to mitigate its exposure to the disappointing Canadian cannabis market by expanding into the U.S. market and into the liquor retail space. The latter now accounts for the majority of SNDL’s revenue, which gained an impressive-at-first-blush 1,170% year-over-year in 2022. However that growth was almost entirely through acquisitions and the company continues to remain unprofitable, so it doesn’t look overly promising for SNDL shareholders in the near-term.8. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 97 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 10th (15 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -49.8% Large-cap stocks dominate most of the remaining list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood, beginning with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney shares soared in late-2020 and looked like a strong bet to continue performing well in the coming years as the pandemic’s impact on its theme parks faded and the subscriber count for its Disney+ streaming platform continued to grow.That’s been anything but the case however, as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares have lost just over half their value since the end of 2020. Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in the company’s fiscal Q2 and it warned that it could experience further subscriber weakness during the current quarter. That’s not a great sign for the division, which is also losing money, though its losses narrowed in fiscal Q2. Hedge fund ownership of Disney is down by over 50% since the end of 2020.VGI Partners took advantage of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s share weakness in 2022 and believes the company still has substantial earnings power according to the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalise over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 244 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 9th (17 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -23.1% The ninth-most popular stock among Robinhood investors since the start of 2021 is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has lost 26% of its value during that time. Normally one of the safer picks on the market in recent years, Amazon struggled at various times throughout the pandemic, being unable to meet the initial surge in demand, and then having too much capacity once the demand began waning again.There was a 14% drop in hedge fund ownership of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during Q4, with fewer hedge funds now being long AMZN than there’s been since 2019. Nonetheless, the company remains the third-most popular stock among smart money managers as of March 31.Arch Capital built a new stake Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during Q1, describing it as a rare opportunity to buy such a special company at a discount, as the fund revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Replacing our Wix investment is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a company we are sure you have heard of before. We believe the company’s long-term growth runway, profit potential, and competitive advantages were being vastly underrated in early January when its market cap was well below $1 trillion. We think early January was one of those rare times you could buy a special business like Amazon at a discounted valuation. Our hope is that – if we are right about its competitive advantages in retail and cloud computing – our Amazon stake will end up being a permanent holding in the limited partnership.”6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 2nd (56 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -6.3% Closing out the first half of our list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), their second-most popular stock overall. It also represents the last of their top ten stock picks that lost money since the start of 2021. Hedge fund ownership of Tesla dipped by 9% in Q1, with John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors and Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments being some of the funds to offload their TSLA stakes.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are still down during the specified period, but are certainly trending in the right direction this year, having more than doubled in value. Some of the biggest concerns that weighed heavily on the stock in 2022 have generally been resolved, including the state of the EV market (which grew by over 60% in the U.S. last year) as well as Elon Musk’s ability to lead the company (he’s since found a new leader for Twitter, allowing him to focus more on what’s happening at Tesla).On the other hand, the company’s profitability is coming somewhat into question now following Q1 price cuts that helped drive deliveries growth but also severely hurt the company’s gross margin, which fell by 9.8 percentage points to 19.3% during the quarter.The Baron Opportunity Fund, which had several managers and analysts attend Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s latest investor day in March, walked away impressed and more bullish on the company than ever, as detailed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.” Click the link below to see how Apple Inc.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.U.S. stock index futures rose on June 1 after the House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the nation's debt ceiling. Investors eagerly awaited labor market data for further assessment. The bill, aiming to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, garnered bipartisan support and now moves to the Senate for enactment before a Monday deadline, crucial to prevent a government funding shortfall. European equities rebounded, driven by improved market sentiment, with media, banking, and mining sectors leading gains while real estate lagged. Bloomberg reported a larger-than-expected drop in underlying inflation in the eurozone, but it's unlikely to deter the European Central Bank from pursuing interest rate increases.According to a report from Bloomberg, Federal Reserve officials are conveying their plans to maintain the current interest rates throughout the month of June. However, they also leave the door open for future rate hikes. This guidance is being provided to influence market expectations and prepare for an upcoming crucial employment report. Governor Philip Jefferson, known for his centrist stance and nominated for the vice chair position, recently said that the decision to hold rates steady allows policymakers to assess the available data carefully. It also provides flexibility for potential tightening measures if warranted. Governor Jefferson's alignment with Chair Jerome Powell's approach further solidifies the message of a patient and data-driven approach to monetary policy. The Fed's communication strategy aims to provide transparency and stability in the face of ongoing economic uncertainties.A recent report from Bloomberg highlights a discernible shift in global investor sentiment, with dissatisfaction mounting over China's stock market performance. As a result, other major markets in Asia are increasingly catching the attention of investors as more appealing alternatives. This divergence in performance has become more pronounced in recent times, with a prominent Chinese stock index experiencing a significant 20% decline from its recent peak. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi index has been showing promising signs of a bull market, while stock benchmarks in India have been steadily approaching record highs. Moreover, Japanese stocks reached an impressive three-decade high earlier in May, further highlighting the attractiveness of Asian markets beyond China. Taiwan, too, continues to outperform many other global stock markets. The relative strength and resilience of these markets compared to China's equity market have sparked interest among global investors seeking alternative investment opportunities.Story continuesThis shift in sentiment suggests a growing recognition of the potential for higher returns and more favorable risk-reward profiles in these Asian markets. The economic growth and stability exhibited by countries such as South Korea, India, Japan, and Taiwan have contributed to their appeal. As investors reassess their strategies and diversify their portfolios, these Asian markets emerge as attractive destinations for capital allocation. The ongoing performance disparity between China and other Asian markets serves as a reminder that regional dynamics and individual market characteristics play a significant role in investment decisions. It also underscores the need for a nuanced approach to global investing, taking into account the unique opportunities and risks presented by different markets within the broader Asian region.Meanwhile, several companies, including Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), were also on the list of 10 stocks receiving price-target hikes from analysts. Check out the remaining article to see the details of the aforesaid price actions.10. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Upside Potential: 3.94%Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) operates home improvement and hardware retail stores in the United States. In April, Bank of America (BofA) included the stock on its 'US 1 List', a compilation of the firm's top investment ideas.On May 24, DA Davidson increased the price target for Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) from $228 to $237 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst acknowledges that the home center industry is currently facing challenges, as home price appreciation, which has traditionally been a significant macro metric, has declined year over year for three consecutive months. However, DA Davidson highlights that Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is consistently narrowing the gap with Home Depot (HD) across key metrics. As a result, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) stock price has outperformed for the sixth consecutive year.09. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Upside Potential: 4.61%Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz has increased the firm's price target for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $340 from $325 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst's research note on May 24, the content presented on day one of the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Build conference heavily focused on artificial intelligence (AI). The analyst is optimistic about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continued innovation and expresses confidence in the company's growth opportunities in the medium term and beyond. Mizuho believes these opportunities, including significant monetization of generative AI, are greater than many currently recognize.Ariel Global Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enterprise software provider, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also traded higher in the period alongside the investor enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence. Microsoft is well positioned as this new technology advances given its large investment in Open AI, the parent company of ChatGPT. Looking ahead, we continue to like Microsoft’s solid fundamentals, competitive positioning and long-term business outlook. We anchor on the company driving value creation by capitalizing on a broad and deep set of opportunities, most notably within Azure, its hybrid cloud infrastructure. The platform continues to demonstrate share gains and strong multi-year purchase intent as enterprises transition to cloud based platforms. At current trading levels, we believe Microsoft’s risk/reward is skewed to the upside.”08. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Upside Potential: 4.97%Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a software company headquartered in Mountain View, California. The firm provides products to enable firms to manage their account, run payroll, and conduct other operations. The company’s primary SaaS products include QuickBooks Online, providing cloud-based accounting and financial management software for small businesses, and QuickBooks Self-Employed, designed for freelancers and independent contractors. Others are TurboTax Online and TurboTax Live, providing online tax preparation and e-filing services for individuals and small businesses.BMO Capital has increased the price target for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) from $462 to $485 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. On May 24, the analyst noted that the company's Consumer segment tax growth is tracking approximately four points lower than expected. The lower growth is primarily attributed to unexpected share loss in the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) channel, assumed from exiting stimulus filers. Despite this, BMO acknowledges the strength of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) small business franchise, the ongoing improvement in Mailchimp, and the product development in B2B payments. These factors are expected to serve as supportive catalysts leading into an important fiscal Q4 for the company.07. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Upside Potential: 6.67%Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) was founded in 1998 and is based in Dallas, Texas. The company manufactures and supplies building materials, engineered components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, and customers in the United States. The company has a 3-year average revenue growth rate of 46.15%. For fiscal 2022, the company grew its revenue by 14.24% year over year.On May 24, Barclays analyst Matthew Bouley increased the firm's price target for Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) from $150 to $160 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst's research note, the investment community is not fully appreciating the positive impact of low home inventory on new construction and its implications for builders and building products. Although the housing market is facing challenges, new construction is showing improvement and is in a much stronger position. While Barclays maintains a cautious stance on building products overall, it is more positive for companies that are well-positioned to benefit from the growth in new residential construction. As a result, Corning has been upgraded to Overweight, while SiteOne Landscape Supply has been downgraded to Underweight. The firm has also raised earnings estimates and price targets for homebuilders and residential distributors.Bonhoeffer Capital Management made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“One of our holdings in the distribution theme is Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), a clustered building products distribution firm. BFS’s growth model is through same-store sales growth (6% per year based upon increased home sales of 1.5 million units from 1.0 million units) and synergistic M&amp;A (4% per year). These are enhanced by opportunistic operational leverage from scale and share repurchases (5% annual growth). Over the past five years, BFS’s net income margins are up from 2% to 13%, with a 3x increase in revenues. These factors should lead to about a 16% EPS growth going forward. BFS has had 82% EPS growth over the past five years. Since August 2021, BFS has repurchased 34% of its common stock.The real driver is the pace at which new home and other construction rebounds from the interest rate shock of the last 18 months. We have used analyst estimates for revenue and free cash flow/earnings for the next two years and longer-term growth assumptions described above. We have also assumed 50% of free cash flow will be used for repurchases (and this may be conservative based upon the past 18 months’ repurchase levels).…” (Click here to read the full text)06. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Upside Potential: 8.43%Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has faced challenges due to increased competition and difficulties sustaining subscription growth.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1,632 million, indicating an 11.3% drop from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable in the past 30 days at $1.44 per share, implying a 50% decrease from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s tally.In the last reported quarter, Signet’s bottom line outperformed the consensus mark by 3.2%. This renowned jewelry and accessories retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 45.1%, on average.Key Aspects to NoteSignet’s quarterly results are likely to have been hurt by a challenging operating landscape, including inflationary pressures. On its last earnings call, management had cited a certain shift in consumer discretionary spending from the jewelry category due to decelerating consumer confidence and pent-up demand for experience-oriented categories. SIG further anticipated the impacts of inflation and other macroeconomic factors to have weighed on consumer spending.Management had earlier expected the jewelry industry to be pressured by macroeconomic headwinds and industry-specific bridal dynamics. Also, persistent headwinds in engagements are likely to have been deterrents. The company had predicted total sales in the band of $1.62-$1.65 billion and adjusted operating income in the range of $97-$108 million for the fiscal first quarter. Also, the first-quarter gross margin is expected to have been hurt by roughly 100 basis points of deleveraged rent expenses with a similar level of impact on selling, general and administrative expenses. The company’s digitally native banners, James Allen and Blue Nile are likely to be a margin headwind till the third quarter when there will be a major accretion from this business.We note that Signet has been taking initiatives to mitigate the supply-chain challenges. SIG’s e-commerce efforts and the Inspiring Brilliance strategy appear encouraging. The Inspiring Brilliance growth strategy focuses on expanding big banners, boosting services, broadening the Accessible Luxury and Value segments, and accelerating digital commerce. SIG has been aiming to enhance the online shopping experience through in-store consultations and services like the buy online, pickup in-store and curbside options. These factors are likely to have provided some cushion to the quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Signet this time around.

61,e9c4b0a1-631c-314b-9410-d7e6896c5192,SIG,2023-06-07,Signet Jewelers' (NYSE:SIG) three-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/signet-jewelers-nyse-sig-three-130509469.html,1686056709,STORY,['SIG'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. But in three years the returns have been great. In three years the stock price has launched 281% higher: a great result. So the recent fall in the share price should be viewed in that context. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.Although Signet Jewelers has shed US$232m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Signet Jewelers was able to grow its EPS at 75% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 56% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 8.47.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Signet Jewelers has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Signet Jewelers the TSR over the last 3 years was 289%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveSignet Jewelers provided a TSR of 2.4% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 5% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Walgreens is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Walgreens, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for WalgreensFor the fiscal year ending August 2023, this largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to earn $4.50 per share, which is a change of -10.7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Walgreens. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Walgreens to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Canada's Tim Hortons and Britain's Pret A Manger are also expanding, but have only a handful of outlets.""Excessively large portion sizes are an American phenomenon,"" said Devangshu Dutta, head of retail consultancy Third Eyesight.""Indian consumers are value-conscious. If adjusting portion sizes down to what is more normal helps make prices accessible, that's a double win.""He was among the analysts who felt the move by Starbucks, operating in India in a joint venture with Tata Group, could further boost its sales, which hit a record $132 million in fiscal 2022/23.Although Starbucks still dominates in India, rivalry is fizzing in the capital, New Delhi, and the technology hub of Bengaluru, where many Third Wave cafes are often as crowded as Starbucks outlets.Story continues""We've lost 30 cups a day to them,"" said a barista at a Starbucks shop in Delhi that sells 7,500 drinks a month, referring to a Third Wave that opened nearby months ago, but already sells 3,700.An employee prepares a drink at a Third Wave Coffee outlet at a market in New DelhiStarbucks has faced homegrown challengers elsewhere, most notably in China, where its 6,200 stores service the biggest market outside the United States.There, in just the last five years, Luckin Coffee has used discounts to lure customers to its 10,000 mostly pickup or delivery stores.BET ON CHAI In India, where Starbucks has added domestic touches to its offerings over the years to boost their appeal, it is now stepping up that game, just as global giants McDonald's and Domino's have done.It estimates that just 11% of Indian homes drink coffee, as opposed to 91% drinking tea. Hot milky tea, or ""chai"" as it is known in Hindi, is sold at roadside stalls by the hundreds of cups each day for as little as 10 rupees (12 U.S. cents).Starbucks, which offered for years just one milk chai ""latte"" made with tea syrup, has launched ""Indian-inspired"" tea offerings laced with spices and cardamom, both favourites in many Indian homes, which start at 185 rupees ($2.24).The drinks were introduced to attract those who do not drink coffee and shun Starbucks, said Dash, adding the company would retain its focus on coffee and not make chai a primary offering.The launch of smaller, cheaper beverages in India indicates Starbucks may have seen ""a decline in traffic related to a pushback"" on higher prices, said Chas Hermann, a U.S.-based restaurant consultant and former Starbucks executive.COMPETITION, SMALL CITIES PUSH In May, people lured by a one-for-one offer queued in a street outside the first Starbucks store in the western city of Aurangabad, a YouTube video showed in scenes reminiscent of when it first opened in India.But its rivals are catching up and a price war has begun.Soon after Starbucks' May launch of $3.33 milkshakes, designed to attract children, Third Wave launched its own range, a fifth cheaper at $2.71.In Bengaluru, startup investors and founders hold meetings in Third Wave outlets. It has more than 40 stores there, exceeding the 35 of Starbucks, data from real estate analytics firm CRE Matrix shows.Third Wave's chief executive, Sushant Goel, said he planned to add 60 to 70 stores every year, with a focus on big cities. He saw Starbucks' cheaper, small-sized drinks as a response to competition in ""an incredibly price-sensitive market"".Coffee grounds and beans are seen at a counter of a Third Wave Coffee outlet at a market in New DelhiMatt Chitharanjan, chief executive of Blue Tokai, said it had ""seen success in converting customers from Starbucks"", partly because of lower prices.While Dash said he was undeterred by competition, Starbucks recognises the threat, although privately.In one lease deal for a Bengaluru mall reviewed by Reuters, Starbucks inserted a ""cafe exclusivity"" clause barring the mall owner from allotting space on the same floor to rival ""premium"" brands, including Third Wave and Blue Tokai.""Going deeper into smaller cities, beyond the metros, is the only way to grow,"" said Ankur Bisen, head of retail at India's Technopak Advisors.(Reporting by M.

Accelerated digital transformation also contributed to the top-line growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AB InBev’s 2023 sales suggests growth of 7% from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.However, BUD continued to witness higher costs and soft margin trends in the first quarter, owing to commodity headwinds and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. This also weighed on the company’s bottom-line results.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 3.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s and Consumer Staple sector’s fall of 3.1% and 2.5%, respectively. The stock’s performance also compared unfavorably against the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 3.2% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere’s Why BUD Looks Poised for GrowthAB InBev is positioned to gain form the premiumization of the beer industry in the long term. The company has been investing to develop a diverse portfolio of global, international and crafts and specialty premium brands in its markets. Apart from the premium brands, the company’s global brands lead the way in premiumization.BUD’s above core portfolio grew revenues by mid-teens in first-quarter 2023. The increase was driven by continued double-digit growth of Michelob ULTRA in the United States and Mexico and double-digit growth of Original and Spaten in Brazil. The company’s three global brands — Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois — advanced 15.4% outside its home markets in the first quarter. Corona brand grew 11.9%, Stella Artois improved 13.3% and Budweiser increased 17.8%, outside of its respective home markets.The company is steadfastly growing its Beyond Beer portfolio, including products like Ready-to-Drink beverages like canned wine and canned cocktails, hard seltzers, cider and flavored malt beverages. The Beyond Beer trend has been recently gaining popularity due to the rise in demand for low-alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. The company remains focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line.The Beyond Beer portfolio contributed more than $325 million to the total revenues in first-quarter 2023. The global Beyond Beer business’ revenues improved low-single digits in the first quarter. The company witnessed 75% revenue growth in Brazil as Beats activated demand during the return of Carnival. In the United States’ spirits-based ready-to-drink segment, the company’s Cutwater and NUTRL vodka seltzer together delivered revenue growth of more than 50%.AB InBev has been rapidly growing its digital platform, leveraging technology, such as B2B sales and other e-commerce platforms, including BEES and Zé Delivery. The company is witnessing acceleration in the B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing trends, which has been aiding growth in the past few months.The company’s digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with B2B digital platforms contributing about 62% of its revenues in the first quarter. BUD noted that the monthly active user base of BEES reached 3.1 million users as of Mar 31, 2023. Its direct-to-consumer ecosystem, including Ze Delivery, TaDa and PerfectDraft, generated more than $100 million in revenues in first-quarter 2023, reflecting low-teens growth year over year.Backed by the continued business momentum, AB InBev outlined its view for 2023. For 2023, the company expects EBITDA growth of 4-8%, which is in line with its medium-term outlook. It anticipates revenue growth to be higher than EBITDA growth, driven by strong volume and pricing.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeAB InBev continues to fall prey to the commodity cost inflation and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. Higher commodity costs mainly resulted from increased aluminum and barley prices. BUD continued to witness higher costs and soft margin trends in the first quarter.The cost of sales increased 8.8% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis in the first quarter. SG&amp;A expenses rose 5.5% year over year and 10.3% on an organic basis. Higher SG&amp;A expenses can be attributed to elevated supply-chain costs.Consequently, the company’s gross margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) to 54.1%, on a reported basis in the first quarter. On an organic basis, gross margin declined 35 bps. Normalized EBIT margin contracted 30 bps year over year to 24.6% in the first quarter. On an organic basis, normalized EBIT margin declined 39 bps.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Monster Beverage MNST, Brown-Forman (BF.B) and Molson Coors TAP.Monster Beverage currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group TransDigm Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Small, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$742 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$795. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 4.6% of Robert Small's stake. Robert Small was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of TransDigm GroupAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. TransDigm Group insiders own about US$199m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The TransDigm Group Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no TransDigm Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of TransDigm Group insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with TransDigm Group and understanding these should be part of your investment process.But note: TransDigm Group may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:HCA) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 30th of June to $0.60. This takes the annual payment to 0.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare HCA Healthcare's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, HCA Healthcare's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 14.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 11% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendHCA Healthcare's Dividend Has Lacked ConsistencyHCA Healthcare has been paying dividends for a while, but the track record isn't stellar. This suggests that the dividend might not be the most reliable. The annual payment during the last 5 years was $1.40 in 2018, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. HCA Healthcare has impressed us by growing EPS at 22% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.HCA Healthcare Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that HCA Healthcare is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for HCA Healthcare that you should be aware of before investing.

(NYSE:GPN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.25 per share on the 30th of June. The dividend yield is 1.0% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Global Payments Global Payments Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. While Global Payments is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 173.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the company could be paying out several times what it earns in the next 12 months, which could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.04 total annually to $1.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 38% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Earnings per share has been sinking by 24% over the last five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

The industry is well-poised to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impacts of the pandemic and increased vaccinations.The multiline insurance industry provides single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payments than paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.With two rate hikes in 2023, investment income should improve further, as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. An improving rate environment is favorable for long-tail insurers. Also, investment income is an important component of an insurer’s top line.Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvements in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023, while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. Per Deloitte Insights, commercial lines are witnessing more growth than personal lines, which is estimated to continue into 2023. Also, homeowners’ premiums have been improving better than personal auto.Consolidation in the multiline insurance industry is expected to continue, as insurers look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities to ramp up growth, and aid these insurers in engaging in shareholder-friendly moves.Insurers have increased investment in emerging technologies in a bid to drive efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, upgrade policy administration and claims systems, and expand automation capabilities across their organizations.Story continuesPrice PerformanceThe industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the Finance sector in the past year. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 3.2% against the sector’s decrease of 5.8% and the industry’s decline of 13.3% in the said time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Nonetheless, product diversification, prudent underwriting and increased exposure should help the multiline insurers bounce back and remain well-poised for the longer term.Value PicksWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three multiline insurance stocks with an impressive Value Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continue to concern the company.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 7.5% compared with a 1.3% rise of the industry it belongs to and the S&amp;P 500 composite’s growth of 3.1%.The renowned medical device outsource manufacturer has a market capitalization of $2.75 billion. The company projects 11.9% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Integer Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 1.7%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Improving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the first quarter of 2023, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 63.4% year over year. The upside was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and continued supplier delivery recovery.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust first-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were also recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin bodes well for the stock.DownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could adversely affect its operating results.Estimate TrendInteger Holdings is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for the current year. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.7% north to $4.15 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $367 million, suggesting a 4.8% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

IDXX is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the performance of the company’s CAG (Companion Animal Group) arm. In the first quarter, key execution metrics remained strong globally, reflecting premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. However, mounting expenses and a negative foreign currency impact are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 23.5% against the 1% rise of the industry and a 3.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $39.03 billion. IDEXX has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 17.3% compared with the industry’s 14.4%. IDXX’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 5.15%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesCAG Continues to Perform Well: IDEXX registered stellar revenue growth within the CAG segment in the first quarter. CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenue growth was supported by global net price gains in the 8%-9% range, consistent with the company’s expectations. Within the United States, new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level resulted in robust volume growth.Internationally, recurring revenue gains were driven by strong IDEXX execution, higher net price realization, sustained new business gains and a double-digit expansion of the premium instrument installed base.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrong Global Performance: Internationally, IDEXX achieved strong organic revenue growth across its modalities in the first quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues witnessed double-digit gains in the United States and international regions.Consumable gains were supported by year-over-year growth in the global premium instrument installed base. This reflected double-digit increases across the Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms.Story continuesThe quality of CAG premium instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflecting 7% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. The company’s newest hematology analyzer, ProCyte One held its momentum globally, reflecting a global installed base that more than doubled over the last year.The global expansion of rapid assay organic revenues was driven by solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization in the United States. Global organic lab revenues registered mid-single-digit growth in international regions.Solid Execution of Growth Strategy Drives Q1 Performance: IDEXX’s first-quarter top line was driven by the continued solid demand for veterinary services and benefits from strong IDEXX execution. The company sustained another record quarter for global premium instrument placements led by its commercial teams. We are encouraged to see strong growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts globally, driving solid EVI achievements.Commercial execution is supported by the multiplier benefits that flow from IDEXX innovations, as evidenced by the success of ProCyte One. For IDEXX, commercial expansion remains an important early step for the international strategy, supporting recent efforts to optimize the reference lab network, roll out highly relevant products like ProCyte One and drive the adoption of software tools like the cloud-based diagnostic portal, VetConnect PLUS.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: The majority of IDXX’s consolidated revenues are derived from the sale of products in international markets. Thus, the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact on the company’s revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and profits from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally.Weak Solvency &amp; Capital Structure: At the first quarter-end, IDEXX had  total debt of $771.3 million, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents of $111.4 million.IDEXX’s total debt-to-capital of 47.8% stands at a moderately high level right now. The industry’s debt-to-capital of 30.9% stands lower than the company.Estimate TrendIDEXX has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $9.57 to $9.65 in the past 60 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.66 billion.

103,fb1f7e3a-4715-385e-b700-f8b5786200c6,NEM,2023-06-07,Wall Street Analysts See Newmont (NEM) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-newmont-133007118.html,1686058207,STORY,['NEM'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Newmont Corporation (NEM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Newmont currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.93, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.93 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Newmont here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Newmont, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NEM a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Newmont, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.1% over the past month to $2.42.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Newmont. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Newmont may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This pattern is more acute for low-carbon feedstocks, the analysis says.Low-carbon biofuel feedstocks accounted for 20% of global feedstock (vegetable oils and low carbon feedstocks) trade flows in 2022, up from barely 10% in 2015. In less than 5 years, the biofuels industry overtook the feed industry to become the dominant user of these materials in the United States, Canada and Europe. The United States began importing significant volumes of used cooking oil from China for the first time in December 2022. China exported 130 thousand metric tons to the United States in the first quarter of 2023, making it the top exporter to the country so far this year.""Biofuel feedstocks have emerged as major global commodities and the race to secure ample supply is a key concern of biofuels producers,"" said Juan Sacoto, Executive Director – Agribusiness Consulting, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""Animal fats and used cooking oil are to them what lithium, cobalt and copper are to battery makers.""Low-carbon biofuel feedstocks are waste products, meaning that the production potential is limited with a low elasticity to growing biofuel demand. As a result, the biofuel industry has started turning to the feedstock import market to make up for the shortage of domestic supply.Story continuesLatin America and Southeast Asia, where meat and vegetable oil consumption are expected to grow at a robust pace for decades, are poised to emerge as strategic suppliers. The collection of animal fats and used cooking oil in these regions will be critical to serve North American and European countries where the production of these feedstocks has plateaued, the analysis says.The analysis expects that efforts to bolster international trade will continue to intensify in the coming years as renewable diesel production is expected to boom by 2030. Somewhat later, the expected growth of sustainable aviation fuel—crucial to decarbonization of that sector—will bring additional pressure to feedstock procurement and reallocation.""The current tightening of feedstock markets could be just a prelude as increased use of sustainable aviation fuel that is expected post-2030 ushers in the biofuel industry's '3rd wave,'"" said Jean-Benoît Deloron, Senior Consultant – Agribusiness Consulting, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.""Airline companies are actively developing their procurement strategies, realizing that much of their long-term carbon reduction strategies hinge on ample supply of low-carbon feedstocks. The chase is on, and it is here to stay.""As the race to secure feedstocks gathers speed, energy companies in North America and Europe are securing feedstocks through integration and joint ventures with domestic agricultural companies. International vertical integration is likely to come next, the analysis says.Elsewhere, integration is developing between the seed industry and biofuel producers with innovative partnerships based on the development of new ""energy"" crops that feature high oilseed yield or oil content, low carbon intensity, the ability to grow between two other crops rotation, and that are not considered food crops.""Demand for low-carbon feedstocks has never been this high, with major implications for road transportation as well as shipping and aviation sectors,"" Deloron said. ""The impacts—not only to agriculture and biofuel markets, but also the food, animal feed and oleochemical industries—are only beginning to be understood.""Media Contacts: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, Jeff.marn@spglobal.comGlobal/EMEA: Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Americas: Kathleen Tanzy + 1 917-331-4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan + 65-6597-6241, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth. In this article, we will discuss top dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Top 16 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned the holdings of 943 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked the top 16 dividend stocks which are most popular among these funds as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that mainly provides commercial banking and investing services to its consumers.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13.

Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare.

(NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

Announcing that it's already reached its 2025 goal providing 25 million female entrepreneurs with solutions to help grow their businesses. Shamina Singh, Mastercard center for inclusive growth president, joins us now. Great to see you again, Shamina. So--SHAMINA SINGH: Nice to see you, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: --talk about this landmark. Very good to see you. Talk about this landmark that was reached because this wasn't supposed to get-- this landmark wasn't supposed to hit until 2025.SHAMINA SINGH: Well, we're really fortunate that we like many people, didn't know that the pandemic was coming, but we prepared in advance. And happened to be in the right place at the right time to ensure that women entrepreneurs, women small business owners, received the support they needed to not only open some small businesses but grow them. And get through the pandemic and then come out even stronger than before. So we're really proud of the achievement but really grateful that we were able to provide those kinds of resources to the amazing women who need them.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so in terms of the stories that stand out when you think about the impact, the economic impact that this can make for these women and the broader communities, what sort of stories stand out for you?SHAMINA SINGH: Well, it's really-- the way I think about it is when you invest in women entrepreneurs, think about it as they pay it back and they pay it forward. They pay it back because their loan repayment rates are over 90% normally for the size and the amount of loans that they are taking. So they're really great risks because they paid the loans back, and they pay it forward.Story continuesWhat we also know is that when you invest in a woman entrepreneur, she pays it forward to her family, to her community, to all of the things that surround her and her small business. So the impact of investing in a woman entrepreneur is double, triple, quadruple what you get when you invest in a single entrepreneur.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to ask you because, obviously, we're in an era of tighter lending conditions. And I know that it's a philanthropic side, but it's also a corporate side and really a partnership here. Have you seen any sort of pullback or perhaps more strategic investments in this space?SHAMINA SINGH: Yeah, it's interesting because-- and that's why I think it's important to say that it is a combination of commercial and philanthropic activity coming out of Mastercard. Because, again, during this time of transition, we have to make sure that we're using every tool and lever at our disposal to ensure that women small business owners and all small business owners come out of this transition period on the other side.And so for the commercial side, we have a whole set of solutions. From the philanthropic side, we have a whole set of enabling solutions. But the point is that as the economic conditions change and as we see loan terms change, we have to make sure we're doing everything we can.And that also means, Rachelle, that we have to think about lending to women sometimes differently. The notions of credit or collateral are different for some women than they are for other borrowers because sometimes they don't have the same types of assets that their male counterparts have. And so that's another creative way and an innovative way that we're looking at partnering with women entrepreneurs.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And one thing that you focus on is an inclusive digital economy. What does that mean now in 2023? Especially when you factor in things like AI and how that's really making sort of a borderless economy when it comes to being inclusive.SHAMINA SINGH: Yeah, I mean, you know, Rachelle, in some respects, digitization, and digitalization for small business owners, it really has to be table stakes. And so, again, before the pandemic, we saw really good adoption of digital processes.During the pandemic, I think it became quite clear that if you weren't able to digitize if you weren't able to operate in a way that allowed you to meet your customers, sometimes remotely, to offer remote payments in a safe and secure environment, you were going to have a really tough time surviving the pandemic. And we've seen that knock-on effect even today that the minimum is digitization of processes and resources. And that's, actually, one of our-- the cornerstones of our strive program globally.We have a strive, small business signature initiative, where we focus on getting capital that we talked about earlier. Going digital, which is table stakes now, but really making sure that we adapt to the new technologies. And growing your networks and know-how. So we have to think of three parts of the stool to support all small businesses but look at them intricately and differently to make sure that we're adapting to the needs of women small business owners.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so when you look at some things like recession fears that are coming up, sort of another potential shake up for some of these small businesses that perhaps would like to hire but aren't able to find people. And would like more funding but perhaps aren't able to get it. How are you preparing them in terms of the resources available that they can use?SHAMINA SINGH: Well, I'd love for any small business owner and for any organization who works with small businesses to really make sure that in the United States, they're working with CDFIs. And those are Community Development Finance Institutions that are mission led and very close to the small business community. In the sense that sometimes they act as a bridge between banks and the small business owners.So that if you are in an environment where you need that extra help, you need the time and attention it takes to get that first loan, the CDFI community, the CDFI space in the United States, and the microfinance institution community outside of the United States are really great places to go.I'll just give you an example. In the United States, we work with Grameen America. We also work with the Community Reinvestment Fund. We work with Momentus Capital.When we work with those organizations, and I would encourage you to look at those organizations, they ensure that not only are they providing the training and the wraparound support and services and the accountability but also access to the capital that the small business owner needs. So especially for women, I would definitely advise you to have a look at Grameen America if you're in the United States and make sure that you connect with the fabulous work that they're doing.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, I do appreciate you especially laying out the resources because sometimes a lot of people just really don't know where to start and where to find them. Thank you so much, and congratulations on that milestone there. Shamina Singh, Mastercard Center for inclusive growth president. Thank you for joining us this morning.SHAMINA SINGH: Thank you.]"

Such partnerships enable MA to capture a significant share of the booming digital payments market of the UAE and broadly, throughout the MENA region.Also, the collaboration with Dapi reflects a time-opportune move on the part of Mastercard, considering the widespread benefits provided by A2A payments and the open banking industry.A2A payments, which are transferred directly from the bank account of a consumer to a merchant’s account devoid of any intermediary’s need, lower the cost of payment acceptance for merchants. It also settles funds in near real time and boosts the cash flow of merchants. Additionally, consumers benefit from a speedy, safe and seamless checkout experience on selecting A2A payments.Therefore, the latest tie-up bears testament to Mastercard’s sincere efforts in integrating hassle-free A2A payments and subsequently, infuse greater digitization within the everyday lives of consumers.Mastercard boasts a solid presence in the open banking industry, that puts intensified focus on bringing about an innovative financial landscape and an accelerated digital transformation journey across different parts of the globe.Story continuesIn fact, Dapi’s open banking capabilities received an impetus with the opportunity to be a part of the inaugural cohort of the Mastercard Start Path Open Banking program last year.  Thereafter, the well-known open banking expertise of Mastercard and the opportunity to work together with the tech giant’s worldwide ecosystem of banks, merchants, partners, and digital players imparted the ability to Dapi to devise advanced open banking solutions for the MENA region and further.Shares of Mastercard have gained 6.5% year to date, compared with the industry’s 6% growth.  MA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are SPX Technologies, Inc.

Scott Devitt, Wedbush Securities Managing Director of Equity Research, joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the state of the travel industry while examining the forecast for ride-share stocks.Video Transcript- The chief executives of Marriott and Expedia, among a long list of travel CEOs, recently telling Yahoo Finance that demand remains strong and the industry is set up for a strong summer season. Wedbush is out with a new note on the sector with a list of names that they think are best positioned. Joining us now is the analyst behind that note, Scott Devitt, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities.Scott, it's good to see you. You just initiated coverage on a number of online travel and mobility stocks. Let's start with the online travel names. Who do you think is best positioned in this environment and why?SCOTT DEVITT: Now we like booking the best. The travel industry has gone through a deep decline during the pandemic. A recovery today, if you listen to the executives, talk about how the recovery continues to be strong. There's going to be a point in time where that no longer is the case. And you want to own best-in-class assets.And what I mean is travel industry is a GDP-type growth industry. Online travel, which I cover, is faster growing, but it's a very high penetration rate. And so, the overall growth rates under normal circumstances are relatively pedestrian for a growth industry. So you want to own these high-quality businesses that are cash generative that are buying back stock along the way. And that is booking.Our second favorite idea, but a neutral rating at the moment because we're just waiting out this period, would be Airbnb. It's a very well-positioned company for the long term. But the challenge that Airbnb faces is that consumers, during and coming out of the pandemic, we're looking at longer stays and more non-urban locations. And now they're looking at shorter stays and urban locations, which more favors traditional hotels.Story continues- So I mean-- let's go back to sort of those two names because I was going to ask you with something like booking. I mean, how much of it is about having a platform that has a number of verticals probably not the right word but a little more diversified in their offerings. Airbnb, we're talking about specific stays, and it is about stays. Where you look at something like booking.com, maybe it's about being able to plan out your entire vacation there.SCOTT DEVITT: That's true. And you have a very diverse traveler with booking. And that 85% of the stays on booking are outside the US. So it's more traditional hotels. About 70% of the bookings on booking are traditional lodging versus alternative. And then you have that international dynamic which, as you've heard from executives in the industry, international is earlier in its recovery, which we think positions booking quite well as well.- Scott, are you seeing signs of normalization? And I guess where are you seeing a bit of a slowdown or a bit of just getting back to where we were pre-pandemic?SCOTT DEVITT: Well, you can see it in a few places. The most recent data that we've looked at shows that revenue per available room night for alternative inventory has declined year over year in the month of April. And traditional hotels still had modest growth in April, but alternative began to decline.In addition to that, you have this dynamic of year-over-year growth rates because there was such a Roar and rally coming out of the pandemic from a low base that-- from a percentage standpoint growth rates were very high for the first year to really a year and a half coming out.We're getting to the point now where you're comping much stronger numbers. So the second quarter of '23 is going to be the first quarter where you have relatively low rates of growth versus what we've been seeing. That's going to continue through the remainder of 2023. And by 2024, the growth rates of these companies are going to look more like they did before the pandemic. That's going to be an interesting test for the stocks, and that's why we're relatively neutral on the group.- Scott, one more name you're watching in the travel space is Expedia. You've got a neutral rating on that. $116 price target there. I mean, how is that different from somebody like Booking Holdings if you're talking about having diversified assets that are being offered on their platform?SCOTT DEVITT: So Expedia is more US-centric. So the company's benefited already from the recovery in the US. And so they're not as leveraged international as booking. There's been a long history of booking outperforming Expedia. And in fact, in terms of total gross bookings since 2019, booking is up 55%, whereas Expedia is flat. So that kind of highlights the strategic differences and the competitive differences that have favored booking versus Expedia.Having said that, if travel holds up longer and the strength continues through the summer into the fall and into the winter, Expedia is a statistically inexpensive stock. It trades at about 5 and 1/2 times EBITDA on 24 numbers. So even though it's not a name from like a growth in longevity standpoint that we tend to favor, we could see the stock move higher if the travel conditions hold up for longer than investors expect.- Scott moving over to your mobility coverage. Uber is your topic in that space. You have an outperform rating on that stock. It certainly has been a leader now for quite some time. What are-- what do you see as the catalyst here for Uber for that continued long-term success?SCOTT DEVITT: So Uber is in the 10 largest GDP markets in its ridesharing business. It is number 1 and 8. In the delivery business and the 10 largest GDP markets, its largest in six. So it dominates the US market relative to its peer Lyft. It performs very strongly outside the US and ride share.There were questions about the viability of this business model before the pandemic. Investors questioned if it could ever be profitable. And now you have a business that's trending towards 2024 with the ability to generate between $4 and $5 billion in free cash flow.In addition to that, there's the delivery business that I would argue that DoorDash probably does a better job in the US than Uber Eats does. But when you look at that business holistically in terms of the international markets that Uber does well in.And the fact that Uber has a wrapped loyalty program, meaning that you subscribe to Uber One, you get benefits for ride-sharing and delivery, which is unique relative to its peers. And now, 27% of total bookings are in the Uber One program. That's a unique competitive advantage that others are not going to be able to match. And it positions the company. Well, for the long term.So the stock's done very well as of most of these stocks over the past three, six, and 12 months. But we are looking for blue chip cash flow generative competitively advantaged companies in an environment that we think may flip from tailwind to neutral to headwind in the next year. And Uber passes that test on the mobility side.- So, let's take one of those factors that you just highlighted. Competitively advantage when you look at a name like DoorDash. They certainly expanded beyond sort of their standard food delivery, restaurant delivery, they have grocery delivery. They've expanded into helping small businesses too. Where do you think they stand in that broader landscape right now? How much of an advantage do they have?SCOTT DEVITT: They have a very strong management team and a very good product. What they don't have yet is proof that the standalone entity delivery business is a good or high-margin business. They're still in the process of proving that out. Whereas, as I mentioned, with Uber, you've got that tied to a ridesharing business that's already proven cash flow capability in global scale.So DoorDash, to me, has potential to be a blue chip company over time. But it still has some a way to go to prove it. More similar to Uber's business pre-dating the pandemic. So we'll monitor it and love the product and the management team. And like I said, I think they do better in the US than Uber's eats business competitively.So it's a company with a lot of potential, but maybe a little bit too early for us given the designation that we're looking for in terms of the types of businesses that we think will outperform from here.- Neutral rating on DoorDash. Price target of 75 bucks. Scott Devitt, great to have you. Thanks so much.]"

The tools also extract information such as hotel prices from existing data to ensure accuracy.For Google, drawing business through AI represents a potential way to close the gap with rivals Amazon and Microsoft, as it has long been a distant No.3 provider of cloud services like data storage.For Priceline, the embrace of novel technology on its website may help it vie with myriad platforms that market travel options, some of which are exploring how consumers react to AI.Its rival Expedia Grouphas saidChatGPT would power conversations on a smartphone app. That is giving travelers ""inspiration on places to go"" and booking options, said Rathi Murthy, its chief technology officer.Both Expedia and Kayak, another site owned by Booking Holdings, have integrated their travel suggestions through features in the standalone ChatGPT program as well.And Google itself has long represented competition for Priceline, though Brodbeck said its cloud capabilities were what led to the partnership.Story continuesThe ability to build applications atop generative-AI that Google pioneered has attracted recent business, said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO.""There is a kind of a Cambrian moment happening now where there's an explosion of this technology,"" Kurian told Reuters, referring to the extraordinary prehistoric period when a wide array of new species emerged.He declined to answer how free corporate previews were affecting Google Cloud's profitability.Google's AI will generate coding suggestions for hundreds of software developers at Priceline, said Brodbeck.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth. In this article, we will discuss top dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Top 16 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned the holdings of 943 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked the top 16 dividend stocks which are most popular among these funds as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

These stakes have a consolidated value of $4.5 billion.15. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based company that specializes in financial software. In fiscal Q3 2023, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion during the same period last year. At the end of April 2023, the company had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $2.8 billion last year.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), one of the best dividend stocks on our list, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. The company maintains a 10-year streak of consistent dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 0.74%.Following the company's recent earnings beat, Street analysts are placing positive ratings on ntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). In May, both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America raised their price targets on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) to $525 and $500, respectively.At the end of Q1 2023, 86 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), worth over $5.2 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Durable Capital Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that mainly provides commercial banking and investing services to its consumers. In May, Raymond James upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $63 price target, highlighting the company's balance sheet and stable net interest margin.On April 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield stands at around 1.92%.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) saw a spike in hedge fund positions in Q1 2023, as 87 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company with an aggregate value of $4 billion, up from 74 in the previous quarter.RiverPark Advisors mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products for a wide range of industries.

These stakes are collectively worth over $5.6 billion.Madison Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has been trading lower since it reported fourth quarter earnings in January. The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare. The claw back payment period goes back to 2011.”12. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based private banking company that specializes in financial information and analytics. On May 3, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share.

(NYSE:SPGI), with a total value of over $7.3 billion.Here is what Wedgewood Partners has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter.“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that owns grocery and department stores across the country.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based investment bank and financial services company. In April, the company reported that its credit card delinquency rate increased to 1.17%, from 1.15% in March. Total receivables in the trust also grew to $1651 billion at the end of April, compared with $161.3 billion in March.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth roughly $30 billion.Artisan Partners discussed reasons to invest in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks and was popular among hedge funds in the most recent quarter.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational financial services company that offers investment and commercial banking services to its consumers.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of over $11.7 billion.Fred Alger Management mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

Yahoo Finance health care reporter Anjalee Khemlani explains why Merck is upset over the law.Video Transcript- Well, Merck taking legal action against the Biden administration over the Inflation Reduction Act. We've got Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani, following that story for us. What are the details, Anjalee?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Akiko. We know that the drug companies have been gearing up for a battle against the imposition that the Inflation Reduction Act has on drug pricing. That is what the government was able to pass in order to allow Medicare to, for the first time in history, negotiate drug prices with companies.Merck fighting back, saying that this is, quote, ""A sham and extortion"" because the health, and the Health Secretary and the administration are allowed to select which drugs, and these companies are not voluntarily a part of this program. In addition, they're being forced to come up with prices that are 25 to 60% discounted from listing prices.And in their defense, in this lawsuit, they're citing the Fifth Amendment. We know that as the right against self-incrimination, but here, it includes the part of which the government cannot seize private property without making a due compensation at the market value. This is the fight that they're pulling with the health department as well as the Health Secretary.And they've said in a company letter that this is really looking at drug development over the years, and incentivizing drug companies. And that is the portion that they're focused on, which is if the government continues to push for these set prices, it is going to deincentivize companies who have invested trillions of dollars in drug development and have sold, of course, we know billions of dollars in these treatments.But in that lawsuit, the context around this is really that Merck is just the first of what is expected to be a number of companies, especially big pharma, taking on similar action. The industry has largely been waiting for this to come through. As we know the deadline approaches for this negotiations to take place this year.Story continuesIt's the first company, and Medicare accounts for 30% of drug spending compared to private payers, so that's why this is such a big battle. It's a huge portion of revenue that they're also looking at that could be impacted. So all told, this is where the battle really is starting.Not unexpected at all, especially towards the end of the year. We expect to see more verbiage from the health department in looking at what the baseline will be for negotiations. They've got draft guidelines out right now. And so we're going to start seeing that firm up more on the agency side, and as you can see already the drug companies ready to battle back.- Yeah, Merck shares down on the day about 3%. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much for that.]"

Boeing shares fall after new issues with the 787 Dreamliner raise concerns that deliveries could be slowed. Finally, Molson Coors shares were upgraded to ""neutral"" by Bank of America. Yahoo Finance Live's Akiko Fujita and Seana Smith break down the stories driving some of Tuesday's biggest stock movers.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: In terms of sectors that we're watching today, energy-- or I should say financials, one of the biggest performers or biggest gainers on the day. That sector up about 1.3%. Of course, crypto another one that you're watching very closely, Seana, on the back of what we saw out of the SEC.SEANA SMITH: Certainly is. And one of the losers of today is Coinbase on the SEC clamp down here, closing in the red. The crypto exchange facing a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleging that Coinbase violated rules that required to register as an exchange. We're looking at losses of about 12% on the day, off 20% in the last two days. And that's because this is the second case brought by the SEC against a crypto exchange, targeting Binance yesterday. So once again, losses across the board.And of course, this brings up the question, just what exactly regulation could potentially look like in this space? And what this does here for crypto and investor interest in crypto down the line?AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's a number of threads going here. One, we have certainly seen sort of the very strongly worded statements coming out of the crypto industry to say essentially that when you go after these exchanges in this way, that could stifle some of the innovation. We also had our guest earlier, Kavita Gupta, saying-- you know, asking that this actually raises more questions.If you think about some of the tokens they went after-- Solana, Cardano, Polygon-- you know, why these specifically? And by the way, her point that she made is that these were on Coinbase. They were listed on Coinbase when they went public.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly. And brings up a lot of questions, just exactly why now, why they are targeting Coinbase? You mentioned some of the strongly-worded commentary coming out here from the industry. Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong saying that the SEC complaint is part of a, quote, ""an enforcement approach that is harming America."" And that pretty much sums up how many in the crypto world are viewing the crackdown here from the SEC.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Let's move on to another story we're watching right now. Shares of Molson Coors moving higher after Bank of America Securities upgraded the stock to neutral from underperform. The analyst noting, Molson Coors US market share gained as a result of the Bud Light boycotts. Of course, it's a story that we've been following very closely there.When you think about what specifically they've highlighted here in that report, they say, it's difficult to determine the duration of the boycott on the back of the influencer who was transgender. But they've already seen-- started to see seen some of the market share gains that Molson Coors is made.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. They're starting to see it reflected in the sales. And they expected to see it reflected in earnings that are coming up, because some people who have decided to boycott Bud Light, they are turning to some of the offerings here from Molson Coors when you take into account Coors like Keystone, Miller Lite, some of the offerings there that people are using as an alternative to the Bud Light boycott.When it comes to what this analyst is saying, he's saying that tap is likely to service the demand spike due in part to some of the supply chain improvement that the company had made on the back of some of the troubles that it did have during COVID. So they are able to meet that demand, the rising demand that they are seeing from the boycott. But when you take into account how long this boycott has lasted, and Bank of America pointed that out in this note, it's lasted a heck of a lot longer than many on the street were initially anticipating.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, they're saying we're going into another big holiday, July 4. And that could have a big impact as well. Another story that you're watching-- I keep saying you're watching--SEANA SMITH: Everyone's been watching it. It's Boeing. Look at that shares closing off just about 7/10 of a percent. The company warning of a new defect on the 1787 Dreamliner planes. As a result, the company is saying that it will delay deliveries of the aircraft. Shares closing lower for the day.And Akiko, this is just the latest of a long list of setbacks here for Boeing. They have had a couple of problems with defects that have forced the company to halt their shipments of the Dreamliner over the last several years. So certainly, not welcome news among investors.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. We're looking at this from a stock perspective, obviously, not good. But there is the question around confidence around Boeing planes as well. The company specifically saying they're inspecting inventory for 1787s right now for what they have described as non-conforming condition related to a fitting on the horizontal stabilizer. Either way, you look at it, certainly not good news for Boeing. And you do wonder how much that delay is going to last.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. Shares closing off just about 7/10 of a percent.]"

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Ligand Pharmaceuticals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Illumina has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that LGND is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.LGND currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.52, while ILMN has a forward P/E of 150.13.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.24% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.73%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the athletic apparel maker had lost 17.09% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 2.05% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.56% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nike as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be June 29, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.66, down 26.67% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $12.57 billion, up 2.73% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.48% lower. Nike is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Nike's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 26.42. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.7, so we one might conclude that Nike is trading at a premium comparatively.Investors should also note that NKE has a PEG ratio of 2.48 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Shoes and Retail Apparel was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.86 at yesterday's closing price.Story continuesThe Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

160,5754978d-c3fb-3540-b08f-0b09b7791365,NKE,2023-06-07,Nike: A Growth Company With Declining Profitability,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-growth-company-declining-profitability-155715026.html,1686067035,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NYSE:NKE) has not been rewarding investors as of late as its shares are down nearly 8% year-to-date. The iconic maker of athletic footwear and apparel has underperformed the S&amp;P 500, which has risen 11.31% so far in 2023.This weak stock price performance can be attributed to two key factors in my opinion: declining profitability and a rich valuation. Nike's shares pose the dilemma of growth versus value. As interest rates in the U.S. are rising, simply focusing on growth stocks and ignoring valuation may not be the best investment decision, as Nike is demonstrating now.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKENike has solid revenue growth and an excellent dividend payout historyInvestors in Nike may not be glad with year-to-date stock price performance, but at least there has been an overall trend of growth in sales. A thorough analysis for the period 2010-2023 shows that with a few exceptions during 2020 and early 2021, Nike has very stable and rising revenue growth history. For example, Nike's annual revenue for 2022 was $46.71 billion, a 4.88% increase from 2021, which was much higher than the $37.403 billion in revenue recorded in 2019.Nike: A Growth Company With Declining ProfitabilityNKE Data by GuruFocusThe latest third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings showed revenue was up 14% compared to the year-ago quarter, or 19% on a currency-neutral basis, Direct sales increased 17% to $5.3 billion on a reported basis (22% currency-neutral), Brand Digital sales increased 20% (24% currency-neutral) and Wholesale revenues grew 12% (18% currency-neutral).Nike has consistently increased its returns to shareholders, with 21 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Nike paid dividends of $528 million, an increase of 9% from the prior-year quarter, and repurchased shares worth $1.5 billion. Share repurchases are planned to continue as Nike approved a program of share repurchases worth $18 billion in June 2022, and for the quarter that ended on March 2023, the company had spent about $3.4 billion, or about 19% of its capital allocated for share repurchases. The dividend yield is a modest 1.26% as the share price has grown faster than its dividend.Story continuesNike has a problem that is reflected by lower profitability For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Nike reported that its gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 43.3% and that diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.79, down 9% year-over-year. The gross margin, net profit and operating profit margins have all been headed lower over the past four consecutive quarters.Assuming investors choose to focus mostly on the net profit margin for profitability, the decline is evident. For the quarter that ended in February 2022, the net profit margin was 13.06%. It then fell in the following quarters to 12.94%, 11.96%, 11.47% and 10.82%.ValuationFor a stock with a declining bottom line, the valuation has become rich.The stock has a price-earnings ratio of 30.32, a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 42.59 and a price-book ratio of 11.13. I do not see a clear thesis for a bargain stock at these levels.On the bright side, Nike has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.61, which is considered very healthy looking at its balance sheet.Nikes economic moat looks sustainable Despite the financial woes, Nike has a very strong economic moat in my view, primarily related to a strong brand. Nike has built one of the most recognizable and valuable brands in the world. The brand is associated with quality, innovation and performance. Nike's brand strength enables it to command premium pricing and maintain customer loyalty.Nike has established a vast global distribution network, including both physical retail stores and e-commerce platforms. The company has a presence in numerous countries and leverages its network to reach a wide range of customers, from athletes and sports enthusiasts to casual wear consumers. Nike is renowned for its focus on product innovation and design. The company invests heavily in research and development to create technologically advanced and aesthetically appealing products. This commitment to innovation allows Nike to continually introduce new and improved products, giving it an edge over its competitors.Nike has formed strategic partnerships and endorsements with some of the world's top athletes, teams and sports organizations. Collaborations with athletes like Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo, among many others, have helped Nike maintain a strong presence in various sports and enhance its brand image. Nike benefits from economies of scale, which allow it to achieve cost advantages through bulk purchasing, efficient production and distribution. The company's extensive supply chain management capabilities help it optimize manufacturing and sourcing processes, ensuring timely delivery and cost control.What about marketing and advertising? Nike is known for its impactful marketing campaigns that resonate with consumers. The company invests significant resources in advertising and promotional activities to create emotional connections with its target audience. This marketing prowess helps Nike stay top-of-mind and reinforce its brand image.Lastly, Nike has successfully engaged with its customers through various means, including social media, mobile applications and membership programs. By building relationships with its customers and providing personalized experiences, Nike strengthens its moat and fosters brand loyalty.While Nike enjoys a strong economic moat, it still faces competition from other sportswear brands. However, the company's consistent focus on innovation, brand strength, distribution and customer engagement has helped it maintain a dominant position in the industry.The bottom lineDon't get me wroing, I love Nikes products for their quality, design and premium features. What about its stock? Unfortunately I do not believe the stock is attractive at this point due to the high valuation and declining profitability. The company has addressed risks like product input costs and elevated freight costs, but I would wait to see an improvement at least in profitability.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This helped determine the pressure distribution and corresponding forces and moments which act on the aircraft.By leveraging Ansys' computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and high-performance computing (HPC) technology, Lufthansa Technik and BASF, a chemical company, designed the coating film with a subtle ribbed texture consisting of small elevations referred to as riblets. The riblet effect imitates the placoid scales on shark skin, which help sharks cut through water effortlessly by reducing drag and friction while increasing buoyancy. Engineers used Ansys' CFD to analyze turbulent flow phenomena surrounding the riblets to ensure they would generate the same effect.Lufthansa Technik used Ansys' tools to build and validate smaller, more generic virtual prototypes of AeroSHARK before scaling and tailoring the prototypes through comprehensive aerodynamic simulations. With the ability to simulate the entire aircraft, including in-flight behavior, and verify the riblet effect using innovative turbulence modeling, Lufthansa Technik reduced the risk of physical flight tests and drastically reduced the time to certification.Story continuesAeroSHARK is certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the American Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) for two types of Boeing 777s and is currently operating in flight by Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Lufthansa Cargo. Once all eleven Boeing 777Fs at Lufthansa Cargo and all twelve 777-300ERs at SWISS have received their AeroSHARK modification, they will reduce the Lufthansa Group's carbon footprint by more than 25,000 tons annually.""AeroSHARK can significantly contribute to more sustainable air transport,"" said Stefan Kuntzagk, senior engineer, aircraft performance, CFD, and flight test at Lufthansa Technik. ""With the ability to model aircraft and aerodynamic behavior in a predictively accurate, robust, and computationally efficient manner by using Ansys' simulation solutions, we can enhance and expand our shark-inspired technology to make entire subfleets more climate-friendly, reduce fuel consumption, and decrease CO₂ emissions for commercial aircraft.""Today, because of successful simulation-powered testing, 40% of the aircraft can already be covered by AeroSHARK with plans to extend its coverage to other areas of the plane.""We are constantly amazed by the creativity of our customers, and Lufthansa Technik has elicited the same reaction with its trailblazing AeroSHARK coating technology, which has the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions,"" said Walt Hearn, senior vice president of worldwide sales and customer excellence at Ansys. ""Our customers continue to demonstrate what is possible when Ansys' simulation solutions are combined with ingenuity and vision. As more sustainable propulsion systems are still being researched and tested, innovations like AeroSHARK are pivotal in the immediate reduction of aviation's carbon footprint.""Visit Ansys at the 2023 Paris Air Show in France from June 19-25 to learn more about simulation's impact in the aviation industry./ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Wells Fargo (WFC).Wells Fargo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WFCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WFCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Wells Fargo here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Wells Fargo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in WFC?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.79.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Wells Fargo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pfizer earned $37.8 billion from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty last year, while Moderna made $18.4 billion from its vaccine Spikevax.Representatives of Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.Promosome attorney Bill Carmody said in a statement that the vaccine makers have ""failed to give Promosome what it deserves"" for creating groundbreaking technology.San Diego and New York-based Promosome was formed to commercialize technology developed by biochemistry researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.The vaccines use mRNA to send instructions to the immune system for producing specific proteins to fight the COVID-19 virus. Promosome said its technology enables the immune system to produce sufficient proteins to fight the virus with small doses of mRNA.The lawsuits said Promosome met with Moderna between 2013 and 2016 to discuss licensing the technology and that Promosome's president demonstrated it to a senior BioNTech scientist in 2015. Promosome said neither company agreed to a license.Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech in the past have denied infringing other patents.

The strategic investment is likely to help the company better serve its clients in an expanding quantum computing ecosystem in the continent. The facility is the second of its kind from the company after Poughkeepsie, NY.Located at IBM's facility in Ehningen, Germany, the data center is expected to be operational in 2024. Leveraging multiple IBM quantum computing systems, each equipped with quantum processors of more than 100 qubits, the facility is likely to cater to cloud-based quantum computing research and exploratory activity of users in diverse domains such as material science, high energy physics, energy transition, sustainability and financial applications. It is likely to help clients manage their European data regulation requirements, while tapping its huge potential to solve some of the world's most challenging problems.In March this year, IBM launched Quantum Computational Center in collaboration with Fundación Ikerbasque in the Basque Country of Spain. The center works with the Basque country government, businesses and academic partners to develop innovative quantum technology solutions to facilitate regional scientific advancement. The collaboration aims to enhance international research and industrial cooperation and construct a world-class quantum-trained community pool with comprehensive learning programs.IBM expects its growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.However, IBM’s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is likely to be a headwind in the near term. Although the public cloud market is expected to be one of the fastest-growing IT categories, with about 25% to 30% CAGR over the next five years, IBM is unlikely to keep up with its competitors. High integration risks from a continuous acquisition spree are potent challenges.In addition, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns. Also, higher profit on lower revenues indicates that the company has been lowering costs to maintain profits. We believe that the scope for further cost-cutting is limited. Consequently, if costs are further reduced, there could be a negative impact on product quality. It could also lead to an additional delay in launching products, denting its long-term growth potential to some extent.The stock has lost 7.2% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 8.5%.

Existing as a legacy spinoff from IBM, and going public without the benefit of an IPO meant having to come up with an effective way to start telling the company’s story in order to survive. Fast forward to today, Kyndryl is now one of the largest corporations in the U.S. by revenue, propelled by a three-part strategy that’s also led to millions in cost savings.Kyndryl Holdings landed at No. 225 on the 2023 Fortune 500 list, generating revenue of $18.3 billion in 2022. The revenue threshold for making the Fortune 500 list was $7.2 billion this year, up 13% from a year ago.Kyndryl is IBM’s previously managed IT infrastructure services business. It was officially spun off from the tech giant in November 2021, making 2022 its first full year as an independent company trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker KD. Kyndryl’s chairman and CEO is Martin Schroeter, a former CFO at IBM. The company claims to be the world’s largest IT infrastructure services provider. Deutsche Bank is just one of the large financial institutions on its roster of clients.Three-A strategyKyndryl faced an uphill battle, saddled with 40% of its contracts that were making little or no profit at the time of the spinoff. A year ago, Kyndryl executives, led by Schroeter, initiated a plan to position the company for long-term sustainable, profitable growth, Wyshner says.“We laid out a series of strategies called the ‘Three A’s’: going after alliances, advanced deliveries, and accounts,” he says. “We put numbers associated with them in terms of what they can contribute over time. And we said we're going to report on these metrics each quarter and each year so that people could see our progress.”Is he sharing the Three A’s strategy in his storytelling to investors? “So much so, that the joke with my investor relations team is that we're going to dress up as the Three A's for Halloween,” Wyshner quips. But the strategy, “I think really resonates with our shareholders because they see how the combination of them can really have a transformational impact on us as a company,” he says.Story continuesWhen it comes to alliances, “it's moving from having been an IBM captive to working with a broader range of leading technology providers,” Wyshner says. Kyndryl had $1.2 billion in signings with cloud hyper-scalers (or massive cloud providers), taking advantage of alliances with AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud. This exceeded the company’s billion-dollar target.Kyndryl is striving to emerge from a legacy of past IBM contracts and eventually move toward a hybrid infrastructure and more efficiency. To take full advantage of customers’ need to modernize and move to the cloud, Wyshner has steadily invested in training. Team members, called “Kyndryls,” now have more than 35,000 certifications on the major cloud platforms, a 100% increase from a year ago, according to the company.Regarding advanced delivery of information to customers, Kyndryl has redeployed more than 5,500 delivery professionals to serve new revenue streams and backfill attrition. This resulted in annualized savings of $275 million versus a $200 million target, Wyshner says.“With advanced delivery, we can be even better in terms of the infrastructure services we provide our customers, and we can reduce our costs at the same time,” he says.With the accounts initiative, Kyndryl is making progress in addressing elements of its business with substandard margins, and helping modernize its clients' IT systems, with applications like Kyndryl Consult. There was $210 million in annual savings from the accounts initiative versus a $200 million target, Wyshner says.“It's really satisfying to see our organization rally around a set of initiatives,” he says. “We communicated them clearly internally, and had people delivering on them in ways very consistent with the faster, more focused culture that we're striving for.”But getting an organization with about 90,000 employees worldwide on the same page during a transformation can have its challenges. “Cultural change takes time,” Wyshner says. “But we're committed to that.” Becoming an independent company, moving off of several hundred IBM systems, and developing new ways of doing things is no small feat. “It's been a lot of work, but I think it's really exciting to tackle,” he says.As the company works its way through legacy contracts, Wyshner is looking forward to the progress of the Three A’s over time, and “the best ways to tell that story,” he says.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Boeing shares fall after new issues with the 787 Dreamliner raise concerns that deliveries could be slowed. Finally, Molson Coors shares were upgraded to ""neutral"" by Bank of America. Yahoo Finance Live's Akiko Fujita and Seana Smith break down the stories driving some of Tuesday's biggest stock movers.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: In terms of sectors that we're watching today, energy-- or I should say financials, one of the biggest performers or biggest gainers on the day. That sector up about 1.3%. Of course, crypto another one that you're watching very closely, Seana, on the back of what we saw out of the SEC.SEANA SMITH: Certainly is. And one of the losers of today is Coinbase on the SEC clamp down here, closing in the red. The crypto exchange facing a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleging that Coinbase violated rules that required to register as an exchange. We're looking at losses of about 12% on the day, off 20% in the last two days. And that's because this is the second case brought by the SEC against a crypto exchange, targeting Binance yesterday. So once again, losses across the board.And of course, this brings up the question, just what exactly regulation could potentially look like in this space? And what this does here for crypto and investor interest in crypto down the line?AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's a number of threads going here. One, we have certainly seen sort of the very strongly worded statements coming out of the crypto industry to say essentially that when you go after these exchanges in this way, that could stifle some of the innovation. We also had our guest earlier, Kavita Gupta, saying-- you know, asking that this actually raises more questions.If you think about some of the tokens they went after-- Solana, Cardano, Polygon-- you know, why these specifically? And by the way, her point that she made is that these were on Coinbase. They were listed on Coinbase when they went public.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly. And brings up a lot of questions, just exactly why now, why they are targeting Coinbase? You mentioned some of the strongly-worded commentary coming out here from the industry. Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong saying that the SEC complaint is part of a, quote, ""an enforcement approach that is harming America."" And that pretty much sums up how many in the crypto world are viewing the crackdown here from the SEC.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Let's move on to another story we're watching right now. Shares of Molson Coors moving higher after Bank of America Securities upgraded the stock to neutral from underperform. The analyst noting, Molson Coors US market share gained as a result of the Bud Light boycotts. Of course, it's a story that we've been following very closely there.When you think about what specifically they've highlighted here in that report, they say, it's difficult to determine the duration of the boycott on the back of the influencer who was transgender. But they've already seen-- started to see seen some of the market share gains that Molson Coors is made.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. They're starting to see it reflected in the sales. And they expected to see it reflected in earnings that are coming up, because some people who have decided to boycott Bud Light, they are turning to some of the offerings here from Molson Coors when you take into account Coors like Keystone, Miller Lite, some of the offerings there that people are using as an alternative to the Bud Light boycott.When it comes to what this analyst is saying, he's saying that tap is likely to service the demand spike due in part to some of the supply chain improvement that the company had made on the back of some of the troubles that it did have during COVID. So they are able to meet that demand, the rising demand that they are seeing from the boycott. But when you take into account how long this boycott has lasted, and Bank of America pointed that out in this note, it's lasted a heck of a lot longer than many on the street were initially anticipating.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, they're saying we're going into another big holiday, July 4. And that could have a big impact as well. Another story that you're watching-- I keep saying you're watching--SEANA SMITH: Everyone's been watching it. It's Boeing. Look at that shares closing off just about 7/10 of a percent. The company warning of a new defect on the 1787 Dreamliner planes. As a result, the company is saying that it will delay deliveries of the aircraft. Shares closing lower for the day.And Akiko, this is just the latest of a long list of setbacks here for Boeing. They have had a couple of problems with defects that have forced the company to halt their shipments of the Dreamliner over the last several years. So certainly, not welcome news among investors.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. We're looking at this from a stock perspective, obviously, not good. But there is the question around confidence around Boeing planes as well. The company specifically saying they're inspecting inventory for 1787s right now for what they have described as non-conforming condition related to a fitting on the horizontal stabilizer. Either way, you look at it, certainly not good news for Boeing. And you do wonder how much that delay is going to last.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. Shares closing off just about 7/10 of a percent.]"

The expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio and investments in B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing bode well. The premiumization of the beer industry has been a key growth opportunity for AB InBev.AB InBev reported sales and earnings in the first quarter of 2023. The top line benefited from strong consumer demand for its portfolio, consistent execution of its strategy and strength of the beer category globally. Accelerated digital transformation also contributed to the top-line growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AB InBev’s 2023 sales suggests growth of 7% from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.However, BUD continued to witness higher costs and soft margin trends in the first quarter, owing to commodity headwinds and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. This also weighed on the company’s bottom-line results.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 3.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s and Consumer Staple sector’s fall of 3.1% and 2.5%, respectively. The stock’s performance also compared unfavorably against the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 3.2% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere’s Why BUD Looks Poised for GrowthAB InBev is positioned to gain form the premiumization of the beer industry in the long term. The company has been investing to develop a diverse portfolio of global, international and crafts and specialty premium brands in its markets. Apart from the premium brands, the company’s global brands lead the way in premiumization.BUD’s above core portfolio grew revenues by mid-teens in first-quarter 2023. The increase was driven by continued double-digit growth of Michelob ULTRA in the United States and Mexico and double-digit growth of Original and Spaten in Brazil. The company’s three global brands — Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois — advanced 15.4% outside its home markets in the first quarter. Corona brand grew 11.9%, Stella Artois improved 13.3% and Budweiser increased 17.8%, outside of its respective home markets.The company is steadfastly growing its Beyond Beer portfolio, including products like Ready-to-Drink beverages like canned wine and canned cocktails, hard seltzers, cider and flavored malt beverages. The Beyond Beer trend has been recently gaining popularity due to the rise in demand for low-alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. The company remains focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line.The Beyond Beer portfolio contributed more than $325 million to the total revenues in first-quarter 2023. The global Beyond Beer business’ revenues improved low-single digits in the first quarter. The company witnessed 75% revenue growth in Brazil as Beats activated demand during the return of Carnival. In the United States’ spirits-based ready-to-drink segment, the company’s Cutwater and NUTRL vodka seltzer together delivered revenue growth of more than 50%.AB InBev has been rapidly growing its digital platform, leveraging technology, such as B2B sales and other e-commerce platforms, including BEES and Zé Delivery. The company is witnessing acceleration in the B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing trends, which has been aiding growth in the past few months.The company’s digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with B2B digital platforms contributing about 62% of its revenues in the first quarter. BUD noted that the monthly active user base of BEES reached 3.1 million users as of Mar 31, 2023. Its direct-to-consumer ecosystem, including Ze Delivery, TaDa and PerfectDraft, generated more than $100 million in revenues in first-quarter 2023, reflecting low-teens growth year over year.Backed by the continued business momentum, AB InBev outlined its view for 2023. For 2023, the company expects EBITDA growth of 4-8%, which is in line with its medium-term outlook. It anticipates revenue growth to be higher than EBITDA growth, driven by strong volume and pricing.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeAB InBev continues to fall prey to the commodity cost inflation and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. Higher commodity costs mainly resulted from increased aluminum and barley prices. BUD continued to witness higher costs and soft margin trends in the first quarter.The cost of sales increased 8.8% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis in the first quarter. SG&amp;A expenses rose 5.5% year over year and 10.3% on an organic basis. Higher SG&amp;A expenses can be attributed to elevated supply-chain costs.Consequently, the company’s gross margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) to 54.1%, on a reported basis in the first quarter. On an organic basis, gross margin declined 35 bps. Normalized EBIT margin contracted 30 bps year over year to 24.6% in the first quarter. On an organic basis, normalized EBIT margin declined 39 bps.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Monster Beverage MNST, Brown-Forman (BF.B) and Molson Coors TAP.Monster Beverage currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

With improving inventory, incentives, and the surging popularity of EVs, the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry is well-positioned for a prosperous future. In this article, we delve into the key drivers that are propelling the U.S. auto industry to new heights and why you should not miss out on two top-ranked domestic auto stocks namely —Ford F and General Motors GM — that are riding the wave of industry strength.About the IndustryThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesImproving Inventory Levels Supporting Pent-Up Demand: With the gradual alleviation of challenges associated with new vehicle production, inventory levels are experiencing significant improvements.According to estimates from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, retail inventory was approximately 1.3 million vehicles at the start of June, reflecting a 48% increase from the previous year. Strong production levels are expected to translate into extended days' supply, thereby providing shoppers with a greater abundance of vehicle options as we move forward.Sweeter Discount Deals Fueling Sales: The increased inventories resulted in more generous incentives being offered to potential buyers. Several manufacturers, including Ford, Hyundai and General Motors among others, have witnessed a significant surge in their incentive outlays. According to TrueCar, the average incentive amount reached $1,931 last month, representing a 13% increase from April and a substantial 64% increase from May 2022. By offering generous incentives, automakers and dealers aim to stimulate demand and entice potential buyers into making a purchase. These incentives not only provide financial benefits but also create a sense of urgency and encourage buyers to take advantage of the deals while they last.Story continuesRapidly Increasing EV Popularity Acts as a Vital Catalyst: The rising adoption of green vehicles driven by climate change concerns, technological advancements, and stringent fuel-emission standards is boosting the prospects of the U.S. auto industry. Electric car demand is skyrocketing and EV sales are consistently breaking records. Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States. Legacy automakers are making significant efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. The Inflation Reduction Act is set to further fuel EV sales. With the continued momentum and expected future growth, the prospects of the U.S. auto industry in the EV market are highly promising.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector.

Its breakthrough is in using an iron-based catalyst to do this in one step, replacing the pricier two-stage process that is usually needed to bring about the chemical reaction.Streamlining the process in this way knocks 50% off the capital cost and produces fewer byproducts, the companies said in a statement.""This cutting-edge solution could be a cost-effective pathway for United to reach our commitment of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen.(Reporting by Isla Binnie in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Intuitive Surgical share price has climbed 91% in five years, easily topping the market return of 45% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 42% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Intuitive Surgical achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 84.32.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Intuitive Surgical's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Intuitive Surgical has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 42% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

SPB received a green signal from the Mexico competition authority to sell its Hardware and Home Improvement segment (HHI) to ASSA ABLOY for $4.3 billion in cash. This was the last step to complete the divestiture. With this, the company expects to close this transaction on or before Jun 30, 2023.SPB estimates net sales proceed of $3.5 billion, which is predicted to repay debt and reduce its gross leverage ratio to 2.5X times in the near term. Any excess money will be invested for organic growth, fund acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.The sale is part of the company’s strategic transformation plan. This long pending definitive agreement was initially announced in September 2021. The transaction is likely to strengthen its balance sheet. The company already simplified the business into three segments — Global Pet Care, Home &amp; Garden, and Home and Personal Care.The company will now be able to prioritize innovation to accelerate organic growth and pursue synergistic acquisitions to further drive value creation in Global Pet Care and Home &amp; Garden. Post the conclusion of this deal, SPB will be able to establish itself as a pure-play consumer staples company.What Else Should You Know?Spectrum Brands’ Global Productivity Improvement Plan and strategic transformation plans bode well. The company is streamlining its organizational structure and re-energizing its employee base. Also, gains from cost-reduction efforts act as upsides.SPB is progressing well with its Global Productivity Improvement Plan, which aims at improving the company's operating efficiency and effectiveness, while focusing on consumer insights and growth-enabling functions, including technology, marketing, and research and development.The majority of savings are expected to be reinvested into growth initiatives and consumer insights, R&amp;D, and marketing across each of its businesses. This plan will also enable the company to deliver value creation and sustainable growth in the long term.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Driven by these factors, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 18.3% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 5%.However, lower first-half demand and inventory reduction by retailers hurt Spectrum Brands’ second-quarter fiscal 2023 year-over-year performance. The company reported an adjusted loss of 14 cents per share against earnings of 41 cents in the year-ago period. Sales fell 9.7% year over year, while organic net sales declined 10.1%.The downside was mainly due to retailer inventory management strategies and slower category POS, offset by positive pricing.For fiscal 2023, the company expects a mid-single-digit sales decline, down from the prior stated low-single-digit growth. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to decline in the low to mid-single digits, down from the earlier mentioned low-double-digit growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Bluegreen Vacations BVH, Royal Caribbean RCL and Crocs CROX.Bluegreen Vacations sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Dallas include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, 97% of people in Dallas now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service is now available through new cell sites recently deployed providing service at Katie Jackson Park and the surrounding residential area, throughout Aubrey north of Highway 380, at Samuell Grand Park and the surrounding area, along I-30 east of downtown Dallas, and in the Little Elm Community of Cross Oak Ranch. Engineers have also increased coverage throughout Collin County specifically in Frisco, Prosper, Celina and Melissa. Lastly, small cells are now providing 5G service in the Legacy Shops, the commerce district just north of Stonebriar Mall, and south of Toyota Stadium in Frisco covering local residential buildings and businesses in that area.Dallas’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Dallas will be able to take advantage of more than twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Even as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout Dallas adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Dallas. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Dallas area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work everyday to ensure we deliver for them. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Dallas, TX with best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “We’re committed to continuing to provide unmatched connectivity to all of our customers across Dallas.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Dallas, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely.

In this scenario, earnings per share in 20 years would be 11% greater than our current assumption and the S&amp;P 500 fair value would be 9% higher than today, holding all else equal,"" strategist Ryan Hammond wrote in a new client note on Wednesday.The S&amp;P 500 currently stands at 4,290 — Hammond's projection sees the benchmark index rising to around 4,719.Hammond cautions, though, that any earnings lift to companies from AI — and subsequent S&amp;P 500 gain — are hard to measure. He does expect upside either way as companies squeeze out margin-boosting productivity gains from the tech.""However, a wide degree of uncertainty exists around the potential productivity boost and the ability of firms to translate AI into increased profits for 10 years.

Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.The guidance helped take Nvidia's market cap to over $1 trillion, though it has since settled to about $955 billion.As for the AI-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite, it's now up 33% year to date compared to a 12% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts the very upbeat outlook reflects a fundamental shift to accelerated computing. In turn, that places Nvidia's chips that power generative AI in high demand.Story continues""We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,"" Huang said on an earnings call. ""You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.""Goldman's Hammond thinks Nvidia'a shocking guidance was a ""galvanizing event for 2023.""""Investors always debate the long-term growth prospects of individual stocks, but it is highly unusual that a large company announces such a quantum leap in its own business outlook.

The S&amp;P 500 index would be negative for the year without the contribution of seven big tech companies.These stocks are Nvidia (up 174.7%), Meta (up 118%), Tesla (99%), Apple (up45.3%), Alphabet (up 40%), Microsoft (up 39.4%) and Amazon (up 44.2%). Their rally has helped the S&amp;P 500 gain about 12% this year (as of Jun 2, 2023).So, basically, we've got a narrow market, where a few winners are driving the rally. Four of these seven companies are some of the largest in the world, with market caps of more than $1 trillion — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon — while Nvidia is loitering around that mark.This is scary since if these stocks get overvalued and the economy lacks strength, the market will fall. Wall Street legend Bob Farrell's rules for investing: markets are weakest when they narrow to a handful of big names, and strongest when they are broad, per a Street article, also suggests the same.Each of the Super Seven is Not OvervaluedNvidia has a forward P/E of 52.7X versus an industry P/E of 36.1X. Tesla has a P/E of 60.1X versus an industry P/E of 19.6X. Amazon has a forward P/E of 79.4X versus an industry P/E of 25.9X. These stocks are overvalued. On the other hand, Microsoft has a forward P/E of 34.7X versus an industry P/E of 30.2X. Apple has a P/E of 30.2X versus an industry P/E of 26.7X. This group still boasts fair valuation.And Alphabet has a P/E of 23.1X versus an industry P/E of 30.2X. Meta has a P/E of 22.6X versus an industry P/E of 30.2X. The duo offers undervaluation, even after a rally. This means the S&amp;P 500 rally is less likely to fade in the coming days, with several tech and communication companies still having strength for a greater run. This is especially true given that both Meta and Alphabet are binging on the AI boom, as is Microsoft. In short, Nvidia doesn’t tell the entire AI story.Story continuesCorporate Financials Likely to Mark a Rebound From Q3The Q1 earnings season gave a consistent and stable performance, with companies surpassing expectations and offering a satisfactory outlook despite the unpredictable macro environment. As a result, the trend of revisions has recently shifted from negative to positive, marking a significant improvement after nearly a year.Shifting Corporate Focus Fuels OptimismBank of America recently indicated that there has been a change in the focus of corporations. Rather than relying solely on factors like ultra-low interest rates, cost-cutting measures, and stock buybacks, companies are now directing their attention toward efficiency, automation and artificial intelligence. This shift suggests a move toward long-term sustainable growth.Far From Overbought MarketThe market is not overbought, indicating room for more potential upside. Presently, only about 40% of stocks trades above their 200-day moving average, in contrast to over 70% historically during overbought periods, per Zacks Research. This dynamic suggests that a considerable segment of the market remains untapped by the current surge and has the potential to benefit from further growth.ETFs in FocusAgainst this upbeat backdrop, if you have faith in the potential market breadth of Wall Street, investors may track S&amp;P 500 ETFs like Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF VOO, iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF IVV and SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY.Investors can also play the growth part of the index with SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF SPYG and the value part of the index with SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Value ETF SPYV. SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF Fund SPYD is a good bet for the dividend plays of the index.Investors can also bet on the leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETFs like Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bull 3X Shares SPXL, ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500 SSO and ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P500 UPRO while the index is on an uptrend.Bottom LineThe sectoral performance and P/E valuations support a case for a sustained rally. Furthermore, a run of strong U.S. data, such as an upbeat labor market, easing inflation, steady interest rates, and decent personal income, create a positive backdrop.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:APD) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$1.16b-US$523.6m-US$449.3mUS$2.39bUS$3.76bUS$4.86bUS$5.89bUS$6.80bUS$7.58bUS$8.24bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x13Analyst x10Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 29.31%Est @ 21.15%Est @ 15.44%Est @ 11.44%Est @ 8.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% -US$1.1k-US$449-US$357US$1.8kUS$2.6kUS$3.1kUS$3.4kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$143bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$143b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$66bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$86b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$279, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Air Products and Chemicals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.993. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Air Products and ChemicalsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

It may sound tempting to build a dividend portfolio made up entirely of high-yielding names, but there are some flaws to such a strategy.Namely, given how common it is for high-yielding stocks to end up becoming yield or value-traps, paper losses can sometimes outweigh the gains from steady-but-large payouts. Hence, placing as much emphasis on factors like quality and dividend growth are key. A portfolio consisting of the best forever hold dividend stocks may have the highest overall yield, yet factors like continued dividend growth, as well as from growth of the portfolio due to price appreciation will more than make up for it.So, what are some of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy right now? Consider these seven. Each one offers a solid yield, has a track record of steady dividend growth, and is reasonably-priced to boot.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGPCGenuine Parts$148.93ITWIllinois Tool Works$218.73JPMJPMorgan$135.71LMTLockheed Martin$444.01LOWLowe’s$201.13MRKMerck$110.41TXNTexas Instruments$173.88Genuine Parts (GPC)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comGenuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a leading distributor of automotive and industrial parts. The company may be best known for its customer-facing NAPA Auto parts brand, and for its longstanding sponsorship of NASCAR.GPC stock, however, may be best known among investors for its status as not only a “dividend aristocrat,” but a “dividend king,” as it has increased its dividend more than fifty years in a row (66 to be exact). At current prices, shares sport a 2.42% forward yield. Over the past five years, GPC has raised its payout by an average of 5.78% annually.Trading for a reasonable 18 times earnings, sell-side forecasts call for the company’s earnings to continue growing in the coming years, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Still, such growth should be sufficient for GPC to sustain (and grow) its valuation, which alongside the dividends could create solid total returns.Story continuesIllinois Tool Works (ITW)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIllinois Tools Works (NYSE:ITW) is many years away from becoming a “dividend king.” However, the industrial conglomerate did attain “dividend aristocrat” status after delivering its 25th consecutive year of dividend growth. ITW stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.33%. Although this doesn’t put it into the “high yield stocks to never sell” category, it is certainly one of the moderate yield stocks to never sell, for two reasons.First, ITW is increasing its payout at a rapid pace. Over the past five years, Illinois Tools Works’ dividend has increased by an average of 11.5% annually. Second, alongside double-digit dividend growth, the company (which prides itself on the effectiveness of its decentralized management structure) has a long history of steady earnings growth, which has resulted in more-than-satisfactory price appreciation for ITW. Shares today trade for 22.3 times earnings.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA few weeks back, I named JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) one of the best Dow stocks. Much of my argument had to do with the money center bank’s big rebound potential, once issues such as the banking crisis and the commercial real estate crisis resolve.JPM stock today trades for around 10.1 times earnings. To many, this valuation may appear more-than-fair, given that other big bank stocks now trade at lower multiples. However, once the issues mentioned above resolve, shares could return to prior multiples (mid-teens). That’s not all.Post-crisis, earnings growth and dividends could mean more outstanding returns ahead for shares. JPM currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.92%. JPMorgan Chase has also raised its payout by nearly 13% annually over the past five years. Taking all of this into account, consider it one of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAdmittedly, after rallying from early 2022 through early 2023, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) shares haven’t performed so hot lately. This defense contracting stock has sold off since April, due to the latest debt ceiling fight between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress.However, as of this writing the current proposed debt ceiling compromise bodes well for defense stocks. At least, that’s the view of Citi analyst Jason Gursky, who on May 30 made this argument, saying that LMT stock and many of its peers will rally if this bill is passed.Much like with JPM, the resolution of overarching uncertainty, coupled with earnings and dividend growth, could mean strong returns ahead for Lockheed Martin shares. LMT has a forward yield of 2.68%, and the company has raised its payout 20 years in a row. Rising geopolitical tensions likely bode well for Lockheed Martin’s future earnings growth.Lowe’s (LOW)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockPreviously, I’ve argued that Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is one of the best buyback stocks. The home improvement retailer is currently in the process of buying back $15 billion worth of its own shares. This equates to around 12.3% of LOW’s current market cap.However, the appeal of LOW stock goes beyond just the company’s share repurchase plans. This is also one of the best long-term dividend stocks. A “dividend king,” with 59 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt, Lowe’s has been aggressive in increasing its payouts in recent years.While currently yielding 2.13% annually, over the past five years, Lowes has implemented annual dividend increases averaging 20.7%. I’m not saying that 20% annual payout increases will continue in perpetuity, but with a payout ratio of just 30.24%, the retailer has room to substantially raise this dividend in the coming years.Merck (MRK)high-yield dividend stocks: a man holding a digital rendering of a bar graph showing increasing valueSource: ShutterstockMerck (NYSE:MRK) is far from reaching “dividend king” status. Even so, don’t underestimate the big pharma company should still be considered one of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy. MRK stock currently has a forward yield of 2.63%. The company’s payouts have grown by an average of 9.41% per year over the past five years. Further earnings and dividend growth may be in store, if analysts earning forecasts are to be believed.Sell-side estimates call for earnings to climb this year and the next. Perhaps, for many more years after that. As InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently argued, Merck has made moves to extend the patent production of its flagship Keytruda cancer treatment. This could result in a long growth runway, creating strong total returns for investors scooping up this stock today.Texas Instruments (TXN)a bag on a table with the word ""dividends"" on it. represent dividend stocks of all time.Source: ShutterstockWhen it comes to chip stocks right now, it’s about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and its high exposure to the artificial intelligence (or AI) megatrend. Yet if you are a dividend investor, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) may make for a better choice.Why? Yes, over the past year, TXN stock has traded sideways, as investors gauge the impact of a near-term weakening in semiconductors for both electronics as well as for industrial use. However, much like many of the other best long-term dividend stocks, shares may be in for a rebound once uncertainties clear up.On a longer time frame, steady earnings and dividend growth could result in strong total returns. Texas Instruments currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.81%. The company has a 17-year track record of consecutive dividend growth, and its payouts have increased by an average of 15.6% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

225,de0369cb-8755-3d9a-96e9-8a3f7832e2ff,CHRW,2023-06-07,Bozeman has a proving curve at C.H. Robinson,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bozeman-proving-curve-c-h-194726325.html,1686080846,STORY,"['CHRW', 'AMZN']","[Dave Bozeman faces a big challenge (Photo: Ford)The selection of David Bozeman as the new CEO of C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. came as a surprise to most people. It may have come as a surprise to some on the company’s 11-person board as well. Typically, a news release announcing such a move will specify if the board’s decision was unanimous. That didn’t happen here.Going into last week, the consensus was that former UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS) COO Jim Barber, who sits on Robinson’s (NASDAQ: CHRW) board, was the odds-on favorite for the job. That a decision had not been made led some to believe that Barber’s IT chops weren’t what the Robinson board was looking for.Bozeman, who starts June 26, lacks C-level experience, a factor that concerned Ken Hoexter, an analyst at Bank of America Securities. For a “company in transition” like Robinson, which has struggled in recent quarters, especially at its freight forwarding unit, a “longer learning curve of a C-level position could be an overhang on turnaround timing,” Hoexter wrote prior to the announcement.Another question will be whether Bozeman has the skill sets such as in freight forwarding, ocean freight and third-party logistics required for such a demanding job. Without any C-level experience, Bozeman has never had to identify and execute strategies to turn around a company. He does have significant supply chain experience, however.Bozeman joins Robinson from Ford Motor Co., (NYSE: F) where he spent less than a year as vice president of its customer service division. He also spent five years as vice president of transportation services at Amazon.com Inc., (NASDAQ: AMZN) where he built the e-commerce giant’s middle-mile delivery network, as well as lengthy stints at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Harley-Davidson Co. (NYSE: HOG).He is also an outsider, a fact that may have weighed in his favor.Bascome Majors, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, was a more sanguine observer. “Today, Dave lacks name recognition with most transport investors,” which might have explained the steep (6.4%) dive that shares took on Monday, he wrote. “That said, we think only a clear ‘slash and burn’ hire would have driven a short-term pop, and Mr. Bozeman’s resume doesn’t fit that narrative (on paper at least).Story continues“Longer-term, his skill set of managing global teams at customer-focused organizations, including at Amazon’s complex transportation &amp; supply chain operation, could help Dave earn the trust of CHRW’s employees and investors, like another former Ford executive (Joe Hinrichs) is doing today at CSX (NYSE: CSX).”Jason H Seidl, analyst at Cowen &amp; Co., said in a Tuesday note that Bozeman’s tenure at Amazon was the key reason he got the job. “We believe his time spent at the home delivery giant could potentially serve CHRW’s digital brokerage platform well,” he wrote.Brittain Ladd, a longtime logistics executive, was cautiously optimistic about the move. “I’m amazed at how many people have reached out to me to question the selection of David. A lot of people don’t understand that a VP of transportation at Amazon has a tremendous amount of responsibility, certainly more responsibility than the average VP of transportation. David is credited with driving a lot of changes at Amazon and he was highly respected.“David can be successful in the role as long as he surrounds himself with the best executives he can hire from Amazon, DB Schenker, DSV and certainly Amazon. David has to own the role of CEO. I believe he will have no choice but to terminate board members [and] to bring in board members who want the company to grow and take risks,” Ladd said.The outspoken Ladd said Robinson under Bozeman “should absolutely go after an acquisition of DSV or at a minimum, acquire Uber Freight.”In addition, Bozeman should contact Capgemini Invent, Deloitte or the Boston Consulting Group and have them conduct an independent review of Robinson’s operations and technology; determine future technology needs and optimal organizational structure; identify acquisition opportunities and which parts of the business to divest if any; and design the optimal go-forward strategy for the company, Ladd said.“If Bozeman doesn’t do this, he will be in a situation where C.H. Robinson executives will do their best to protect their pet projects and fiefdoms. Bozeman needs an independent assessment of the company and a strategy that he can drive using a team he can trust,” he said.  The post Bozeman has a proving curve at C.H.

Robinson finds a new CEO.(Image: boredpanda.com)Everything out West is totally fine — nothing to be concerned about, except maybe a few things regarding the West Coast port labor negotiations. We’ve officially hit the one-year anniversary of starting the new labor union contract conversation. Sadly, there was no weekend getaway to the mountains, just some work disruption.The International Longshore and Warehouse Union on Friday effectively shut down operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, driving the workers’ point home that they are none too happy with ocean carriers and terminal operators.Labor stoppages aside, negotiations haven’t completely broken down. FreightWaves’ Greg Miller reported ILWU President Willie Adams “highlighted the health risks and lives lost of ILWU members during COVID and the ‘astronomical revenues’ of ocean carriers during that period, and argued that ILWU members deserve ‘an economic package’ that accounts for their role in the shipping industry’s windfall — in other words, they want a piece of the pandemic profit pie. Adams specifically pointed to the falling percentage of ILWU wages and benefits in comparison to PMA profits.”This technically is the second major disruption this year, the first being the night shift on March 30 and day shift March 31. The good news is that since there is less container volume coming in on the West Coast, some of the long-term impacts of any work stoppages won’t be felt as deeply as if they occurred when there were 109 ships waiting to berth.(gif: giphy)All the talk of reshoring manufacturing operations seems focused on Mexico and not Canada. Yes, Volkswagen is building a $14 billion battery plant for electric vehicles in St. Thomas, Ontario, that is slated to open in 2027, but Mexico seems to get a new facility of some sort every day.Story continuesLabor in Canada is still affordable but not nearly as cost effective as labor in Mexico. John Boyd, principal for the Boyd Co. Inc., said in Noi Mahoney’s story: “Canada’s long suit historically has been in the natural resources field, being a global supplier of timber, precious metals, natural gas, crude oil, crude bitumen and coal. The EV industry is a major end user of lithium for the production of auto and truck batteries. That said, two of North America’s largest deposits of lithium are in Canada.”(SONAR TRAC Market Dashboard)TRAC Tuesday. This week’s TRAC lane of the week is a long one, from Detroit to Memphis, Tennessee. This 735-mile journey runs about $2.29 a mile on the spot market. An all-in rate of $2,066 before margin should suffice to get this lane covered. Carriers will be eager to drive the spot rate up as it seems that spot rates are climbing with no chance of stopping. Hold firm on rates as outbound tender rejections in Detroit have fallen 450 basis points since last week. A major plummet to the OTRI has come and that should bring spot rates down a little, as Memphis’ OTRI has started increasing.(Gif: Tenor)Who’s with Whom. Cars and trucks are kind of the same thing in regard to transportation, right? C.H. Robinson has thought along the same lines as the hunt for a new CEO is over. David Bozeman, an executive at Ford Motor Co., has been tapped to take over the U.S.’ largest freight brokerage. It turns out the choice might not be as strange as it appeared. Bozeman spent some time at Amazon Transportation Services, Caterpillar and Harley-Davidson Motor Co. The man knows a thing or two about vehicles.FreightWaves’ Mark Solomon wrote that C.H. Robinson “has struggled with a sharp downturn in demand. Robinson had also struggled in recent months amid concerns about increased competition from the likes of new broker RXO Inc. However, it had lost market share in general in what had before been a historically strong environment for contract brokerage, from which Robinson generates most of its revenue.”(Image: LinkedIn)Double broker red flags Double broker red flag No. 3: Thou shalt not trust an address. The devil works hard, double brokers work harder. After perusing LinkedIn, I stumbled on this post. It turns out if you go to physicaladdress.com you can get a random physical address for a “business” for the cost of an average Starbucks run, $8 a month. This isn’t a sign to never trust a carrier’s address, but maybe take an extra few seconds to look it up on Google Maps, the way you would look up a residential delivery and run a few landmarks by the carrier to verify it’s legit.Got any tips that are your favorite?

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are a few of the most popular stocks on Robinhood that have delivered strong returns for the platform’s users since the end of 2020.The Robinhood app has been a game changer for retail investors, allowing them to quickly and easily trade stocks and build a portfolio of assets while avoiding the hefty fees that have traditionally plagued the investment space.In place of charging users fees on their trades, Robinhood utilizes a process called payment for order flow, which directs all of the app’s trades through larger entities which can then leverage the power of their increased order sizes to receive more favorable trades. In return, those entities pay a small fee to Robinhood for the use of their trades, the volumes of which can be significant when it comes to the most popular stocks on Robinhood.The app skyrocketed to popularity during the pandemic, nearly tripling in size from 4.3 million monthly active users in 2019 to 11.7 million a year later. There was another seismic jump to 17.3 million MAUs in 2021 during the height of the meme stock craze, which Robinhood played a noteworthy role in. However, activity on the platform has fell substantially in 2022, declining back to 11.4 million MAUs, though the number of funded accounts inched up to a new high of 23 million.Robinhood clearly appeals to a younger user base that wants to dip its toes into stock trading but doesn’t have the assets or wherewithal to invest tens of thousands of dollar with brokerage firms like Charles Schwab. The average user account value on Robinhood was just $4,000 in 2021, compared to $234,000 in Charles Schwab’s case.Given its users’ penchant for small positions and bets on riskier growth stocks, it’s worth looking into the best penny stocks on Robinhood to see which under-the-radar stocks the platform’s users have identified as potential gems. Given that one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood is a cannabis stock, it’s unsurprising that several cannabis-based companies also feature prominently among the best  penny stocks on Robinhood according to its users, including Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NASDAQ:ACB) and Jupiter Wellness, Inc. (NASDAQ:JUPW).Story continuesOn the other end of the spectrum, the most popular stocks on Robinhood feature several of the best stocks to invest in 2023 according to hedge funds and analysts alike, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) (the most popular stock among Robinhood users), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).When it comes to the performance of Robinhood users’ most popular stocks, it’s been quite a mixed bag as you’ll see in the below results. Five of the ten stocks have been big winners for Robinhood investors, while the other five have been losers, four of them being significant losers, with losses in excess of 23% dating back to January 1, 2021.Read on for all the details about the 10 most popular stocks on Robinhood and how they’ve performed for their bullish retail investors over the past two-and-a-half years.10 Most Popular Stocks on RobinhoodWAYHOME studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo compile the following list of Robinhood most popular stocks, we analyzed the top holdings among Robinhood’s users as of the beginning of each quarter during 2021, as well as their top holdings at the beginning of 2022 and the current top holdings on the platform. We then took the top 10 holdings from each of those six periods and assigned them a points value: ten points for first place, nine for second, and so on, down to one point for tenth.Finally, we added up the points to create a final list of the top ten most popular stocks on Robinhood over the past two-and-a-half years. We have ranked and ordered those ten stocks based on their stock performance since January 1, 2021 to determine which popular Robinhood stocks delivered the biggest returns for the platform’s users.Unlike the Robinhood Investor Index, which trails the market since its inception, Insider Monkey has developed several easy-to-follow, market-beating investment strategies. We follow a select group of hedge funds because our leading independent research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns over the long-term.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood10. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 15 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 6th (19 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -84.4% Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of most popular stocks on Robinhood that turned out to be good investments for the platform’s users.On the opposite end of the spectrum is NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), which has been nothing short of a disaster for Robinhood investors, losing 84.4% of its value since the end of 2020. Nonetheless, it remains one of their top 10 holdings to this day. On the other hand, numerous hedge funds were cutting their losses and abandoning their NIO long positions in Q1, as there was a 38% decline in smart money ownership of NIO.Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the most prominent funds to sell off its NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stake during Q1, one of 12 stocks the influential money manager is selling in 2023.While NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) still has intriguing long-term prospects in the EV space, having now expanded its deliveries into Europe, the company has been plagued by supply chain and production problems that have crushed the stock in the near term. The company’s also facing increasing EV competition in its Chinese home market. While 2023 deliveries are up by 22% year-over-year through April, they’ve been sliding in the wrong direction on a monthly basis and are about to come up against tougher comps.9. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 5 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 5th (27 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -69.4% SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) was also one of the 5 Meme Stocks Redditors are Buying in April of 2022. Unfortunately for both Redditors and Robinhooders alike, the Canadian pot stock has destroyed the value of their investments in a puff of smoke, losing 69% of its value since the end of 2020. Just five hedge funds were long SNDL on March 31, down from seven a quarter earlier and the lowest total since the final quarter of 2020.SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s struggles are by no means unique among Canadian cannabis companies, which have majorly failed to live up to expectations. The legal Canadian cannabis market simply hasn’t developed anywhere near the extent that was anticipated for a variety of reasons, including consumer dissatisfaction about the quality and cost of legal pot. Industry sales were just $3.7 billion in the first ten months of 2022 according to StatsCan, well below earlier projections that had the industry raking in $7 billion annually by this point.SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) has attempted to mitigate its exposure to the disappointing Canadian cannabis market by expanding into the U.S. market and into the liquor retail space. The latter now accounts for the majority of SNDL’s revenue, which gained an impressive-at-first-blush 1,170% year-over-year in 2022. However that growth was almost entirely through acquisitions and the company continues to remain unprofitable, so it doesn’t look overly promising for SNDL shareholders in the near-term.8. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 97 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 10th (15 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -49.8% Large-cap stocks dominate most of the remaining list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood, beginning with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Disney shares soared in late-2020 and looked like a strong bet to continue performing well in the coming years as the pandemic’s impact on its theme parks faded and the subscriber count for its Disney+ streaming platform continued to grow.That’s been anything but the case however, as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares have lost just over half their value since the end of 2020. Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in the company’s fiscal Q2 and it warned that it could experience further subscriber weakness during the current quarter. That’s not a great sign for the division, which is also losing money, though its losses narrowed in fiscal Q2. Hedge fund ownership of Disney is down by over 50% since the end of 2020.VGI Partners took advantage of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s share weakness in 2022 and believes the company still has substantial earnings power according to the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalise over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 244 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 9th (17 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -23.1% The ninth-most popular stock among Robinhood investors since the start of 2021 is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has lost 26% of its value during that time. Normally one of the safer picks on the market in recent years, Amazon struggled at various times throughout the pandemic, being unable to meet the initial surge in demand, and then having too much capacity once the demand began waning again.There was a 14% drop in hedge fund ownership of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during Q4, with fewer hedge funds now being long AMZN than there’s been since 2019. Nonetheless, the company remains the third-most popular stock among smart money managers as of March 31.Arch Capital built a new stake Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during Q1, describing it as a rare opportunity to buy such a special company at a discount, as the fund revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Replacing our Wix investment is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a company we are sure you have heard of before. We believe the company’s long-term growth runway, profit potential, and competitive advantages were being vastly underrated in early January when its market cap was well below $1 trillion. We think early January was one of those rare times you could buy a special business like Amazon at a discounted valuation. Our hope is that – if we are right about its competitive advantages in retail and cloud computing – our Amazon stake will end up being a permanent holding in the limited partnership.”6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 Robinhood Popularity Ranking (Q1 2021 – Q2 2023): 2nd (56 points) Stock Performance (January 1, 2021 – June 6, 2023): -6.3% Closing out the first half of our list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), their second-most popular stock overall. It also represents the last of their top ten stock picks that lost money since the start of 2021. Hedge fund ownership of Tesla dipped by 9% in Q1, with John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors and Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments being some of the funds to offload their TSLA stakes.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are still down during the specified period, but are certainly trending in the right direction this year, having more than doubled in value. Some of the biggest concerns that weighed heavily on the stock in 2022 have generally been resolved, including the state of the EV market (which grew by over 60% in the U.S. last year) as well as Elon Musk’s ability to lead the company (he’s since found a new leader for Twitter, allowing him to focus more on what’s happening at Tesla).On the other hand, the company’s profitability is coming somewhat into question now following Q1 price cuts that helped drive deliveries growth but also severely hurt the company’s gross margin, which fell by 9.8 percentage points to 19.3% during the quarter.The Baron Opportunity Fund, which had several managers and analysts attend Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s latest investor day in March, walked away impressed and more bullish on the company than ever, as detailed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.” Click the link below to see how Apple Inc.

Two recent movie releases show that isn't the case anymore.Last weekend, Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" (SONY) secured a $120.65 million domestic debut, according to the studio, beating conservative estimates of $80 million. It was the best opening ever for Sony Pictures Animation and the third-biggest opening weekend for any Spider-Man film.The film’s gross marks the second biggest opening of 2023 thus far, narrowly surpassing Disney's (DIS) ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3,"" to land behind another animated title — Universal's ""Super Mario Bros. Movie"" (CMCSA.)The films add to the firepower of Universal and Sony at the US box office, which is dominated by Disney.""These were huge franchises and characters that people love, but maybe underpinning that even more is the fact that there has been this pent-up demand,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, told Yahoo Finance. ""The last couple of years, even though movies have been coming back, the straggler out of all of the content was animation and family-friendly content. A big part of that is because those films take so long to produce and were naturally going to be the most impacted from all of the COVID delays.""The economics of animated film'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (Source: Sony)According to Robbins, animated films typically require a production window that is two to three times longer than that of traditional movies due to the intricate work of animator teams, which have to create each second of the film from scratch.At the same time, such movies tend to cost less because they don't require physical sets and actors. That means significant potential upside for studios — especially if a movie is based on a pre-existing franchise with a built-in audience of children and their parents, Robbins said.""Kids tend to rewatch content they love over and over, and that's an affordable cost that parents can certainly justify in their household budgets as they try to save money and keep their children entertained at the same time,"" he continued.Story continuesRobbins said ""Spider-Verse's"" success can also be attributed to its diverse cast of characters with the film featuring a Black and Puerto Rican title character, Miles Morales.""So many people from different ethnicities are represented in the movie. It's broader appeal outside of just the traditional Marvel fan base that we talk about,"" he said, adding positive reviews from both critics and audiences likely boosted receipts, as well. ""People just want to go out and spend money on content that they know they can come out and feel good about and spread that word of mouth.""'Changing of the guards' The successful debuts of both ""Spider-Verse"" and ""Super Mario Bros."" show how Disney, historically the pioneer in animation, is getting some fresh competition from other studios.In 2022, Disney led the box office with $1.93 billion in ticket sales, or 26% of the overall market share, according to a Deadline analysis based on Comscore data.Universal came in second with $1.64 billion, or 22% of market share. Sony is in a smaller bucket, with its 2022 domestic box office coming in at $843.8 million, representing 11% of market share.Despite Disney's position as the top film producer, the company has faced recent struggles, particularly around its animation business.Last summer, Pixar's ""Toy Story"" prequel ""Lightyear"" fell short of expectations, securing just $51 million in its domestic debut before going on to gross a mere $118 million in theaters ahead of an expedited Disney+ release.More recently, the animated film ""Strange World,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid cost the company a reported $200 million after it opened to dismal reviews during Thanksgiving week, marking one of the worst flops of 2022.Industry watchers blamed the misses on poor marketing plans and audience confusion over which titles were theatrical exclusives and which were streaming-only releases on the company's Disney+ platform.That, coupled with poor word-of-mouth reviews, contributed to these films' lackluster performance, in Robbin's view.""I think we're in a new era,"" he said. ""It certainly looks a little bit like a changing of the guards with other animation studios doing so well and Disney not necessarily being at the forefront of it right now.""Disney CEO Bob Iger referenced ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" during the company's latest earnings call, suggesting more upside to its own theatrical business as the executive resets the company's strategy.""Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of ‘Super Mario Bros.,'"" Iger said on the call. ""It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theaters around the world, and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business.""Comcast, the owner of Universal, noted the success of the franchise, along with others such as ""Despicable Me,""""Shrek,""""Pets,"" and ""Minions"" on its own earnings call.""These are the results of the strategic decision we made years ago to become a leader in animation and the conviction we've had to continue to invest in the business even during the depths of the pandemic, which are now clearly paying off,"" CEO Brian Roberts said.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -11.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has lost 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.1%. This estimate has changed -4.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.23 indicates a change of +36% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.67 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $89.83 billion and $94.67 billion estimates indicate +8.6% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $21.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.3%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.03%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

239,a9212934-c8af-36c2-ac87-272620407f6b,EXC,2023-06-07,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-exelon-corporation-100611706.html,1686132371,STORY,['EXC'],"[Key InsightsUsing the Dividend Discount Model, Exelon fair value estimate is US$33.81Current share price of US$39.75 suggests Exelon is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for EXC is US$45.84, which is 36% above our fair value estimateDoes the June share price for Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Exelon What's The Estimated Valuation?As Exelon operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%. Relative to the current share price of US$39.8, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)Story continues= US$1.6 / (6.9% – 2.1%)= US$33.8dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Exelon as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ExelonStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Through the Future of Energy scholarship program, ComEd offers awards of up to $10,000 each with a goal of supporting more diverse, local students in pursuing education in STEM, which is increasingly important due to the clean energy transition underway in Illinois and around the country.Since its launch in 2022, the ComEd Future of Energy Scholarship has awarded nearly $640,000 to 115 local students. Expanding opportunities for area youth to pursue STEM degrees is critical to ComEd’s work to establish a diverse, qualified talent pipeline that is prepared to support the power grid and the growing number of clean energy jobs that will be created in the years ahead. A recent study commissioned by ComEd projects that 150,000 new jobs in Illinois could be added by the year 2050 as a result of the clean energy transition.""At ComEd, we know that today’s youth will play a critical role in addressing tomorrow’s challenges and opportunities, including a growing demand for skilled talent to support our transition to a cleaner future,"" said Gil Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. ""Through the Future of Energy Scholarship, ComEd is expanding equitable opportunities for our youth, so that more women and persons of color can be a part of the exciting work to modernize the grid and create a cleaner, brighter future for our communities.""The 2023 ComEd Future of Energy scholarship winners reflect a high level of diversity, with 95 percent new awardees identified as people of color or women. This fall, 12 percent of the first-time scholars are poised to attend a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) across the country. New to the program this year is renewal scholarships, through which, 22 current FOE scholars have earned a scholarship for the second year that will cover a portion of their college tuition and renewable expenses. The program continues to prioritize candidates based on need by reserving over 80 percent of new awards for families who earn an annual income of $99,000 or less.Story continuesIn addition to the financial award, all new scholars will have the opportunity to intern with ComEd, provided that they remain enrolled as a full-time student and taking classes, meet GPA requirements and complete the company’s hiring process.""I’m beyond grateful for this scholarship and the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience through my summer internship at ComEd,"" said Aliyah Muhammad, a Glenwood native, who is pursuing a Business Administration &amp; Management degree at North Carolina A&amp;T State University. ""Both my twin brother and I were awarded, so it not only takes some of the financial burden off of my mom of sending twins to college, but it lets us know that hard work pays off and that you really can do anything that you set your mind to.""Working with National Energy Education Development (NEED), ComEd reached students across its service region to jumpstart their STEM education with the help of the Future of Energy scholarship program. Students interested in pursuing STEM degrees in the future can find out more information about eligibility and how to apply for future scholarships at https://needorg.my.site.com/ComEd/s/scholarship-information.""The students selected for the scholarship are a testament to ComEd’s commitment to the future of the energy workforce,"" said Mary Spruill, Executive Director at The NEED Project. ""These students come from a diversity of backgrounds, but each have shared that this scholarship allows them to focus on their studies rather than focusing on all of the expenses pursuing a degree requires. I cannot wait to see what these students are capable of thanks to ComEd’s support.""The Future of Energy Scholarship is one example of how ComEd is preparing more future leaders for careers in energy and construction. In addition to STEM and scholarship programs, ComEd is invested in expanding job training programs to help job seekers develop the skills needed to support the growing demand for electric vehicles, solar and grid operations. These programs are dedicated to recruiting more women and persons of color for roles serving the diverse and vibrant communities found across the ComEd service territory. Last year alone, ComEd STEM and workforce development programs reached nearly 2,000 people in northern Illinois.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

MBLY, with a 30-day option to underwriters to purchase an additional 5.25 million shares. The secondary offering of the Israel-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies provider is likely to generate about $1.5 billion for Intel to fuel its investment plans.Intel acquired Mobileye in 2018 for $15.3 billion to rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA and Qualcomm. With the buyout, Intel gained access to Mobileye’s technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management. This increased its customer base and augmented its top-line growth.However, the company has been facing dwindling overall sales largely due to PC inventory correction and contraction in the server market. Revenues declined significantly in first-quarter 2023 owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment, uncertain business conditions and softening demand trends. Softness in the end consumer and educational market demand is likely to remain an overhang on the company’s performance.Consequently, top management has embarked on a massive investment roadmap by developing new manufacturing hubs and improving its operating technology to bring the company back to its growth trajectory. The public offering of Mobileye stock is perhaps an initiative in this regard, although it is likely to reduce its ownership stake to about 88%.Intel is betting big on the IoT business and is investing heavily to gain a higher market presence. While the focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them, the company now prefers to focus on a product range targeting different market segments. Management believes that although the higher-end businesses in more developed economies continue to look up, the new strategy should help it get into many more device categories, where Intel products will likely continue to enjoy a premium based on performance and TCO.The stock has lost 31.5% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 51.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksInterDigital, Inc.

242,c2d087aa-fdd4-3bff-8da1-df930fe7e9a8,HP,2023-06-07,Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP) shareholders have endured a 35% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-nyse-hp-shareholders-142232069.html,1686061352,STORY,['HP'],"[Ideally, your overall portfolio should beat the market average. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 50% over a half decade. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 38% in the last year. Furthermore, it's down 25% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Helmerich &amp; Payne became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower. On top of that, revenue has declined by 8.5% per year over the half decade; that could be a red flag for some investors.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthHelmerich &amp; Payne is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Helmerich &amp; Payne will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Helmerich &amp; Payne's TSR for the last 5 years was -35%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 3.5% in the last year, Helmerich &amp; Payne shareholders lost 35% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 6% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Before spending more time on Helmerich &amp; Payne it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But intelligent investors may want to play it safe with dividend stocks.Because as the debt ceiling negotiations continue, investors may become nervous, resulting in market volatility. When faced with market uncertainty, playing it safe and investing in quality is wise. So it makes sense to listen to an investing legend about stock quality. Quoting Peter Lynch, “This is one of the keys to successful investing: focus on the companies, not on the stocks.”Below are four quality dividend stocks to play defense in case of unexpected market behavior. Some dividend stocks tend to have lower volatility when the market faces uncertainty, providing peace of mind.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMcDonald’s (MCD)MCD Stock: a McDonald's sign and logo on the side of a buildingSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is the largest quick-service restaurant chain in the world. Consumers know it as a place for fast, consistent food. The company owns or franchises 40,000+ restaurants globally. It sells burgers, chicken sandwiches and nuggets, french fries, sodas, shakes, coffee, and so on, to billions of customers annually. The firm is the market leader by far, with $23.183 million in revenue in 2022 and $23.415 million in the past 12 months.Despite periodic negative press about unhealthy meals, the firm continues to grow over time. Moreover, the company has expanded in the face of relentless competition in a business with no barriers to entry. But McDonald’s future revenue growth will come from expanding locations, adding menu items, and price increases.McDonald’s success has allowed it to return cash to shareholders. The stock is a Dividend Aristocrat with 48 years of increases. The forward dividend yield is 2.1%, with a five-year growth rate of 8%. Moreover, the payout ratio is only 56%, giving confidence about the dividend safety and future growth. In addition, it receives a dividend quality grade of B+.Story continuesThe stock is not volatile, with a five-year beta of 0.63. Additionally, consumers purchase the company’s food and drinks in good times and bad. McDonald’s is probably priced near fair value, but investors may want to track this stock for a good entry point.California Water Service Group (CWT)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comWater is an essential service for consumers and businesses. Hence, water stocks are solid conservative investments because of their regulated nature and monopolies. A primary player in San Jose, California, is the California Water Service Group (NYSE:CWT). Besides northern California, the firm operates in Hawaii, New Mexico, Washington and Texas, giving the utility national scale.Organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions have resulted in the continued growth of water and wastewater connections. The firm has roughly 496,400 customer connections in California; 6,200 in Hawaii; 37,500 in Washington; 10,700 in New Mexico; and 2,200 in Texas. California Water serves about 2 million people.California Water is a Dividend King, one of three water utilities on the list. Its dividend growth streak is 56 years. The five-year dividend growth rate is around 6.8%. The forward yield is 1.88%, more than the past five-year average. The utility also receives an A+ dividend safety score.Water stocks tend to trade at a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and California Water is no exception. The forward P/E ratio is about 29x, but the value is below the five-year and 10-year ranges. Furthermore, the beta value is low at 0.48. Hence, we view this stock as a buy now.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comA quintessential defensive stock is Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), the producer of oral, personal care, home care and pet nutrition products. The over 200-year-old firm is the global market leader in toothpaste, with a ~40% market share. Besides Colgate, the company’s other brands include Ajax, Palmolive, Tom’s of Maine, Speed Stick, Softsoap, Sanex, Filorga, etc. Total revenue reached $17.967 million in 2022 and $18.338 million in the past 12 months.Growth drivers are brand extensions to increase market share and periodic tuck-in acquisitions. The firm acquired Filorga and Hello in 2019 and 2020. New brands benefit from Colgate’s marketing and distribution scale and cost efficiencies. The combination has allowed Colgate-Palmolive to attain high gross and operating margins.Colgate-Palmolive is another Dividend King with 60 years of increases. However, dividend growth has slowed to the low-single-digits because the firm operates in mature markets, and the payout ratio is near 62%. The forward dividend yield is 2.45% supported by a dividend quality grade of A.The stock usually trades at an elevated P/E ratio because of its consistent performance and defensive characteristics. Consumers need toothpaste and other items regardless of economic conditions. However, Colgate-Palmolive trades at a valuation near the bottom of its five-year range, and the beta is only 0.49. Consequently, we view Colgate-Palmolive as a buy.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comThe last stock on our list is Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), the giant warehouse retailer. Costco is known for its enormous, no-frills warehouses selling large quantities of electronics, groceries, personal and household care products, clothing, gasoline, and more. Despite selling less items in fewer stores, the company’s business model has allowed it to reach $226.954 million in sales in 2022 and $234.39 million in the trailing 12 months.Costco will probably add to the total sales by opening new stores in new geographic areas in the United States and internationally. The retailer makes its profits mainly on membership fees that are increased every few years. Customers obviously like Costco’s offerings and way of selling because renewal rates are 90%+.In addition, Costco is a dividend growth stock with 19 years of increases, making it a Dividend Contender. The growth rate is typically between 10% and 13% per year. The firm has many more years of increases ahead of it because of the modest ~26% payout ratio. However, the dividend yield is low at only 0.83%.Inflationary headwinds in 2022 and 2023 have pushed the stock price down from its all-time high. As a result, it is trading at a P/E ratio of ~34x, below its five-year range, but still high. Nevertheless, with a beta of about 0.79 and an A+ dividend quality score, investors may want to buy this high-quality retailer.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli held LONG positions in MCD, CL and COST.

Two recent movie releases show that isn't the case anymore.Last weekend, Sony's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" (SONY) secured a $120.65 million domestic debut, according to the studio, beating conservative estimates of $80 million. It was the best opening ever for Sony Pictures Animation and the third-biggest opening weekend for any Spider-Man film.The film’s gross marks the second biggest opening of 2023 thus far, narrowly surpassing Disney's (DIS) ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3,"" to land behind another animated title — Universal's ""Super Mario Bros. Movie"" (CMCSA.)The films add to the firepower of Universal and Sony at the US box office, which is dominated by Disney.""These were huge franchises and characters that people love, but maybe underpinning that even more is the fact that there has been this pent-up demand,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, told Yahoo Finance. ""The last couple of years, even though movies have been coming back, the straggler out of all of the content was animation and family-friendly content. A big part of that is because those films take so long to produce and were naturally going to be the most impacted from all of the COVID delays.""The economics of animated film'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (Source: Sony)According to Robbins, animated films typically require a production window that is two to three times longer than that of traditional movies due to the intricate work of animator teams, which have to create each second of the film from scratch.At the same time, such movies tend to cost less because they don't require physical sets and actors. That means significant potential upside for studios — especially if a movie is based on a pre-existing franchise with a built-in audience of children and their parents, Robbins said.""Kids tend to rewatch content they love over and over, and that's an affordable cost that parents can certainly justify in their household budgets as they try to save money and keep their children entertained at the same time,"" he continued.Story continuesRobbins said ""Spider-Verse's"" success can also be attributed to its diverse cast of characters with the film featuring a Black and Puerto Rican title character, Miles Morales.""So many people from different ethnicities are represented in the movie. It's broader appeal outside of just the traditional Marvel fan base that we talk about,"" he said, adding positive reviews from both critics and audiences likely boosted receipts, as well. ""People just want to go out and spend money on content that they know they can come out and feel good about and spread that word of mouth.""'Changing of the guards' The successful debuts of both ""Spider-Verse"" and ""Super Mario Bros."" show how Disney, historically the pioneer in animation, is getting some fresh competition from other studios.In 2022, Disney led the box office with $1.93 billion in ticket sales, or 26% of the overall market share, according to a Deadline analysis based on Comscore data.Universal came in second with $1.64 billion, or 22% of market share. Sony is in a smaller bucket, with its 2022 domestic box office coming in at $843.8 million, representing 11% of market share.Despite Disney's position as the top film producer, the company has faced recent struggles, particularly around its animation business.Last summer, Pixar's ""Toy Story"" prequel ""Lightyear"" fell short of expectations, securing just $51 million in its domestic debut before going on to gross a mere $118 million in theaters ahead of an expedited Disney+ release.More recently, the animated film ""Strange World,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid cost the company a reported $200 million after it opened to dismal reviews during Thanksgiving week, marking one of the worst flops of 2022.Industry watchers blamed the misses on poor marketing plans and audience confusion over which titles were theatrical exclusives and which were streaming-only releases on the company's Disney+ platform.That, coupled with poor word-of-mouth reviews, contributed to these films' lackluster performance, in Robbin's view.""I think we're in a new era,"" he said. ""It certainly looks a little bit like a changing of the guards with other animation studios doing so well and Disney not necessarily being at the forefront of it right now.""Disney CEO Bob Iger referenced ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" during the company's latest earnings call, suggesting more upside to its own theatrical business as the executive resets the company's strategy.""Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of ‘Super Mario Bros.,'"" Iger said on the call. ""It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theaters around the world, and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business.""Comcast, the owner of Universal, noted the success of the franchise, along with others such as ""Despicable Me,""""Shrek,""""Pets,"" and ""Minions"" on its own earnings call.""These are the results of the strategic decision we made years ago to become a leader in animation and the conviction we've had to continue to invest in the business even during the depths of the pandemic, which are now clearly paying off,"" CEO Brian Roberts said.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:PRU) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-17-past-prudential-financial-130029369.html,1686056429,STORY,['PRU'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Prudential Financial's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 39% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyIf you want to know who really controls Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 57% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$1.1b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 17% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Prudential Financial. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Prudential Financial. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudential Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Prudential Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$53m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 42% stake in Prudential Financial. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Prudential Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

252,6566d822-6885-3b8f-936a-0792a715ff83,DVN,2023-06-07,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-attracting-130012777.html,1686056412,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -5.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share, indicating a change of -43.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.30 points to a change of -24.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.85 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -29.1%. The $16.11 billion and $16.61 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -16% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

254,583d44f0-a9ef-333b-b583-c9fd11cf4441,MU,2023-06-07,12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-hot-stocks-buy-according-121521749.html,1686140121,STORY,"['META', 'CRM', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'NOW', 'AAPL', 'MU', 'TSM', 'CRWD', 'TSLA']","[In this article we present the list of 12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are some of the hottest stocks on the market this year, which is likely of little surprise to their bullish hedge fund shareholders, which own each of them in significant quantities.Stocks are off to a strong start in 2023 as they look to rebound from an underwhelming 2021 and an even poorer 2022. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has gained 11.9% this year on the heels of 19.5% losses in 2022, while the NYSE is up a more modest 1.3% after 11.5% losses last year. The biggest winners though have been tech stocks, as the Nasdaq has soared by 26.9% year-to-date following a 33.1% decline in 2022.That’s left no shortage of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, with several of their top 10 most popular stocks all delivering big returns this year, while the majority of stocks on this last, all of which have gained at least 30% in 2023, rank among their 30 most popular stocks. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks occupy most of the spots on this list, with AI being a key theme that is driving many of their results to new heights or expanding their capabilities in exciting ways.To determine which hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, you first need to know how to find out what hedge funds are buying. Insider Monkey specializes in exactly that, publishing dozens of articles quarterly on the latest hedge fund activity according to their most recent 13F filings with the SEC, in which hedge funds with more than $500 million in assets under management must disclose their holdings.Insider Monkey also compiles the quarterly ownership data from a select group of 900+ top performing funds to create industry and other theme-specific lists of what stocks hedge funds are buying now, so investors can get a quick snapshot into how some of the brightest minds in the investment world feel about the prospects of companies compared to their rivals in various industries and sectors.Story continuesCritics sometimes point to the fact that any list of the hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is already outdated by the time their holdings data becomes available, given that most hedge funds don’t disclose their holdings until the 13F filing deadline approximately six weeks after the date on which they’re reporting their holdings. However, given their general focus on long-term investing, this criticism is relatively unwarranted and makes them the ideal investors to piggyback for anyone who’s looking to build a portfolio of diversified assets with great long-term potential.That’s not to say we don’t see significant swings in hedge fund ownership of certain stocks each quarter, as just a single event or earnings report can dramatically alter the long-term outlook for companies. In other cases, some of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds see slight declines in ownership in the following quarter(s) simply because they’ve been doing so well and may have reached a valuation point that has surpassed the fair value estimates that some funds have on those stocks.With all of that in mind, let’s check out 12 hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, which have enriched their shareholders with at least 30% returns this year.12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following list of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment and include only the most popular stocks among hedge funds which have posted at least 30% gains year-to-date. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 102 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 32.3% Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are a few of the hottest stocks buy according to hedge funds, who own large stakes in all of those high-performing stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is another hot stock hedge funds love, having hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership during Q1, topping 100 for the first time. The number of smart money TSM shareholders has more than doubled over the last four years. Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital and Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital were among the funds to add TSM to their 13F portfolios during Q1.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the first of several semiconductor stocks to make the list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds thanks to its dominant position in the high-performance chip market, where it currently controls close to a 90% share of the global market. As the demand for top-of-the-line chips intensifies in the coming years thanks to the expected robust growth in AI and cloud computing applications, Taiwan Semiconductor appears poised to continue its impressive growth and further grow its already-strong margins.Wedgewood Partners likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s long-term growth outlook, as relayed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”11. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 73 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 34.5% Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have rallied this year after a miserable 2022 that saw them lose 46% of their value. While they still have a ways to go to make up all of those losses, their 38.2% gains year-to-date have convinced several hedge funds to go long MU, including Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, which bought nearly 4.3 million MU shares in Q1.Despite recently being banned in China when it comes to certain critical infrastructure projects and installations, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have outperformed even TSM’s this year, gaining 35% year-to-date. According to Bernstein analyst Mark Li, the impact of the China ban should be relatively negligible for Micron in the grand scheme of things, as Micron’s enterprise segment accounts just 20% of overall revenue, with China’s portion of that likely accounting for as little as 2% of overall revenue.Claret Asset Management noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares had lost nearly half their value through the first nine months of 2022 in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 289 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 40.2% Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most popular stock among hedge funds in terms of single-ticker ownership (Alphabet has more hedge fund shareholders combined between its two tickers) and it hasn’t disappointed smart money managers this year, returning 36% year-to-date. Unsurprisingly, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, is the largest MSFT shareholder with 39.3 million shares. Its 13F portfolio has 31% exposure to Microsoft.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is taking some intriguing steps to eat into Google’s search dominance, having recently integrated its own search engine Bing into the AI chatbot ChatGPT, a move that was facilitated by Microsoft’s earlier $13 billion investment in the AI platform’s creators, OpenAI. The tech giant is also gaining a strong foothold in the cloud computing space, as Azure is slowing gaining market share on Amazon’s AWS.Alger Spectra Fund discussed the latest AI innovations at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services. Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows Devices, Gaming, and Search). While the company reported decent fiscal second quarter results, their investment in OpenAl’s ChatGPT captured the attention of investors. Contributing to positive performance. Throughout the quarter. Microsoft surprised investors with continual rollouts of new Al capabilities across the company’s portfolio (e.g., Bing, GitHub. Teams, Office 365). Furthermore, the company announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which leverages GPT-4, a large language model, combined with the Microsoft Graph of data to provide Al virtual assistance. We believe Microsoft’s investment in OpenAl provides a first-mover advantage in the Al transformer model space. Despite challenges in the early days of Al-powered applications, the pace of Al innovation is faster than any other enterprise technology previously observed, in our view.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOGL)/155 (GOOG) Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 41.2% Hedge fund ownership of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) peaked at the end of 2021 with nearly 400 long positions in the company’s class A and class C shares being held by hedge funds (some of which owned both classes). That was followed by a 6.9% drop in ownership during the first-half of 2022 and another slight dip in the first quarter of this year.Considering the broad questions facing the long-term viability of Google Search in the age of AI, as outlined in the Microsoft writeup above, it’s perhaps somewhat surprising to see Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares up 41% this year. That said, the effect of ChatGPT/Bing on Google Search’s market share has been negligible thus far. In fact, Google’s market share rose by 20 basis points to 92.8% in April compared to December 2022, when ChatGPT was first unleashed. And while Search undoubtedly remains the company’s bread-and-butter when it comes to ad revenue, it also has a strong cloud division that grew revenue by 28% in Q1, while YouTube remains the world’s dominant streaming platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users.The Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy detailed why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of its strongest Q1 performers in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft and Booking Holdings, all of which posted double-digit gains. Shares of media and technology giant Alphabet outperformed as the company announced expense discipline while continuing to invest in its core products of Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.”8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 96 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 44.4% Shares of SaaS workflow platform operator ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) have shot up by 38% in 2023 as the company continues to grow its business at an impressive rate. Hedge funds may be getting concerned about the stock’s valuation, as their ownership of NOW has ticked down slightly for three straight quarters, but it nonetheless remains one of the 30 most popular holdings among smart money managers.ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also turning to AI to bolster the digital transformation suite of services that it offers clients, including recently launching an AI collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the hottest stocks on the planet in 2023 (look for it in the second half of this article). The company will use Nvidia’s software to train its own proprietary AI algorithms in how to better manage workflows and disrupt bottlenecks. ServiceNow is also well on the path to profitability, which has investors excited about the stock’s near-term and longer-term outlook.The Polen Global Growth Strategy believes ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) can grow free cash flow at a greater than 20% annualized rate over the next three-to-five years, which it outlined in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 131 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 46.8% Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another prominent tech company that’s rallied in 2023, gaining over 38%. That’s great news for investing icon Warren Buffett, whose 13F portfolio has unprecedented exposure to the mobile tech giant at 46.4% as of March 13. Overall, there was a slight drop in hedge fund ownership of Apple during Q1.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares slumped by 27% in 2022 but have quickly made up those losses this year, having pushed back near their all-time highs. While the iPhone still accounts for over 50% of Apple’s revenue, its higher-margin services segment continues to grow at an accelerated rate, hitting $20.9 billion in revenue during the company’s fiscal Q2 of 2023. That robust services segment also gives Apple an impressively high moat, as it keeps customers insulated within its own ecosystem, which is undoubtedly why Buffett is such a fan of the company.RiverPark Large Growth Fund believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is still one of the most innovative and well-positioned mobile tech companies in the world, as it divulged in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were our final top contributor for the quarter. While the company reported a rare quarterly earnings miss, investors had expected slower sales due to macro headwinds. Services continue to be a bright spot for the company with an all-time high of $21 billion in quarterly revenue, a 6% year-over-year increase, and management expects iPhone revenue growth to re-accelerate in 2Q. Operating Cash Flow was $34 billion for the quarter, and the company returned $23 billion to shareholders in the last three months, including $4 billion in dividends and $19 billion in share repurchases.With an installed base of 2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment (now 18% of revenue), we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best-positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”6. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 49.2% There was a 25% drop in hedge fund ownership of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) during the final quarter of 2022 as investors worried about weakening demand for the company’s cybersecurity offerings. There was a slight 9% rebound in hedge fund positions in Q1, during which Crowdstrike posted promising Q4 results and boasted a record Q1 pipeline.Closing out the first half of our list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), yet another company that has been successfully using AI, in this case to bolster the speed and efficiency of its cybersecurity solutions. CrowdStrike’s extensible platform has clearly struck a positive note with the majority of its clients, over 60% of which use at least five of the company’s modules. CrowdStrike isn’t overly profitable yet, but it is beginning to generate more free cash flow, a figure which could top $1 billion in the company’s current fiscal year.Artisan Developing World Fund discussed CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)’s latest financial results in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included graphics semiconductor company Nvidia, Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Sea, Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre, online travel marketplace Airbnb, and endpoint security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.” Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have performed even better than the aforementioned seven stocks this year, and are also highly regarded by world-class hedge funds.

Learn more about Steve Plank, Chief Technology Officer of Taco Bell in this installment.EDUCATIONPennsbury High School, Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, United States(1992 -1993)Temple University, BS in Computer Science, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States (1993 - 1997)University of Southern California, MBA, Business Administration, Los Angeles, California, United States (2009 - 2011)If we were to interview your teachers, what would they say about you?Steve was a committed scholar and athlete who put in the work to succeed.What did you want to be when you grew up?I wanted to be a Major League Baseball player, specifically first baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies. Growing up in Philly and playing Little League and pick-up games in my free time made for a lot of dreaming.WORKFirst job: I started working residential construction with my dad from a very young age. I also worked a paper route when I was 12, but my first traditional job was working at JCPenney selling sneakers and sports apparel from ages 16-22.First Consulting Group | 1997-2002: Consultant, Wayne, Pennsylvania, United StatesAmgen, Inc. | 2002-2004: Senior Programmer/Architect, Thousand Oaks, California, United StatesBaxter Healthcare | 2004-2005: Director, Regulatory Informatics, Westlake Village, California, United StatesAllergan, Inc. | 2005-2007: Director, Regulatory Information Management &amp; Publishing, Irvine, California, United States | 2007-2010: Senior Director, Global Information Services, Irvine, California, United States | 2010-2015: Vice President, Technology Delivery, Irvine, California, United StatesTaco Bell | 2015-2016: Senior Director, Back of House Technology, Irvine, California, United States | 2016-2017: Vice President, Technology Delivery, Irvine, California, United States | 2017-present: Chief Technology Officer, Irvine, California, United StatesStory continuesWhat moments, or who, in your life influenced the way you work?Working construction with my dad: Coming home physically exhausted and seeing how hard my dad tried to make ends meet made me realize the value of hard work. It also brought a sense of satisfaction, seeing the results of something you built. I find many parallels to that in my work with technology today.My grandmother: She was widowed two days after I was born and was left to raise my aunt, who was a physically handicapped teenager at the time. I was always amazed by her strength and ability to overcome adversity, accept reality and move forward. I learned many lessons from her and miss the hours we spent talking on the back porch. She had a tremendous ability to put things in perspective and help me appreciate the most important things in life.Playing sports: I played multiple sports starting at a young age and through high school. I wasn't the biggest or the fastest, but I learned that with commitment and enough practice, you can improve in almost anything.Do you believe in work/life balance?I believe in balance and integration of family, friends, work, hobbies, learning and passions. That has never meant 9-5 or a predetermined split of time. Balance is fluid based on all the roles you are playing and needs at any given time. I do believe that it is critical to be fully present and focused wherever you are at. Time is our most precious commodity, and I value it more today than I did years ago. I make it a point to maximize every moment with my family and friends.What do people think you do versus what you actually do?I always find it funny that technology can be such a mystery. My parents think I fix computers all day (and they call me often for help).The role at Taco Bell has been a lot of fun because it's easier for people to understand what I do now compared to previous roles I've had. At this point, I consider myself a leader at the intersection of technology and business with a passion for maximizing the opportunity that innovation can deliver.Most of my time is spent creating and evangelizing a cohesive technology strategy in support of the overall brand objectives, building the team and removing roadblocks where needed in order to deliver Yum!'s overall commitment of easy experiences, operations and insights for franchisees, customers and team members.What is the best piece of advice that you've been given?""Don't let perfect be the enemy of better.""What makes you happy?Time with friends and family, and embarking on new adventures, big and small. One of my more recent joys has been the opportunity to coach my son's sports teams (primarily baseball). When on the field, everything else in the world goes away for a few hours. It's been amazing to be part of so many kids' development and meet new families and friends along the way.Yum!

The deal adds almost $173 billion in loans and will increase market share among wealthy clients.Higher rates, global expansion initiatives and a steady loan demand will support net interest income (NII).

Rowe Price Group's TROW organic growth and business expansion are key strengths for the company. However, a rise in operating expenses and increased dependence on investment advisory fees are likely to affect it’s financials in the near term.Though the company's net revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2023, it witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.2% over a three-year period (ended 2022). Going forward, the company’s efforts to strengthen distribution channels in different geographic regions and mix shift toward international growth funds will drive top-line growth.T. Rowe Price has been able to sustain positive earnings throughout the global financial crisis, supported by its diverse business model. The company's assets under management (AUM) witnessed a CAGR of 5.2% over the past six years (2017-2022). However, the trend declined in first-quarter 2023 due to weaker markets. Nonetheless, its diversified AUM across asset classes and client base is likely to support earnings in the upcoming period. We estimate the AUM balance to grow 3.1% this year.TROW has successfully expanded its business operations through several opportunistic deals over the years. In April 2023, it acquired Retiree, a fintech firm providing innovative retirement income planning software.Further, T. Rowe Price expanded its footprint and capabilities through the acquisition of Oak Hill Advisors in December 2021. With this acquisition, it bulked up its offerings in the alternative investment market space. We believe such endeavors will likely support its prospects in the long term.TROW’s substantial liquidity, which included total cash and investments of $4.49 billion as of Mar 31, 2023, enables capital deployment activities. The company has hiked quarterly dividends every year since its IPO in 1986, the most recent being a sequential hike of 1.6% in February 2023. Also, in the first quarter of 2023, it repurchased 25,000 shares at an average price of $109.83 per share. Such efforts reflect the company’s commitment to enhancing shareholder value.Story continuesFurther, analysts are optimistic about the stock’s earnings prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TROW's current-year earnings has been revised marginally upward over the last seven days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past three months, shares of TROW have fallen 0.9% compared with the industry's 4.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, rising operating expenses are a major concern for the company. Expenses saw a three-year (2020-2022) CAGR of 9%. The rising trend continued in the first quarter of 2023.As TROW continues to incur expenses to attract new clients and make additional investments from existing clients, its ability to expand the bottom line might get hampered. Our estimate for non-GAAP operating expenses implies a five-year CAGR of 5.3% by 2025.Investment advisory fees are the biggest revenue source for T. Rowe Price. The increased dependence on these can affect the company's financials in the near term because of the AUM changes, owing to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translation, regulatory changes or a sudden slowdown in business activities.Further, the bulk of assets managed by T. Rowe Price is invested in U.S. equities, which seems to be another concerning factor. Despite the company’s efforts to adopt various strategies to diversify its product mix across other asset classes and geographies, concentration in U.S. equities is a significant risk that could lead to inconsistent asset flows.Finance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc. CASH and First Citizens BancShares FCNCA.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pathward Financial’s current-year earnings has been revised 1.8% upward over the past 60 days. Its shares have gained 11% in the past six months. Currently, CASH carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).First Citizens BancShares currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. These factors are favorable for prominent industry players like NetApp NTAP, Pure Storage PSTG and Teradata Corporation TDC. The democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to act as a tailwind for industry participants. The rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, cautious IT spending amid global macroeconomic turbulence is a major headwind in the near term along with volatile supply chain dynamics, inflation and component shortages.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.4 Trends Shaping the Computer - Storage Industry's FutureNew Normal Trends &amp; Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: Implementation of hybrid work models have triggered the demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Effective storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones. The accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance have led to a data explosion for enterprises.Story continuesInnovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: broader storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth on the back of a rapid increase in the amount of data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is a positive for industry players.Macro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending in the Near Term: Weakening IT spending amid global macroeconomic weakness is likely to remain a headwind in the near term. Increased budget scrutiny, especially cloud-cost optimization by clients and forex volatility, are affecting top-line performance of the industry participants. Consumer spending cuts on the purchase of PCs, tablets and printers are likely to hinder IT spending growth. In the long run, higher technology spending on transformation projects including data security, application modernization, analytics and AI by enterprises augurs well for industry participants.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments declined 30% to 55.2 million units in the first quarter of 2023, according to the data compiled by Gartner. Sales were affected by a huge inventory pile-up amid a slump in demand. Intense promotional activity by vendors to clear inventory was another headwind. Further, global macroeconomic weakness, geopolitical instability in Europe and inflationary pressure are leading to careful IT spending by business organizations. A slowing PC market does not augur well for the industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks you may want to consider for your portfolio, considering bright prospects, let us look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 but Lags SectorThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index but lags the broader sector in the past year.The industry has gained 5.3% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s gain of 3.3%. The broader sector has gained 10.7% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E (or Price/Earnings), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer storage devices companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 201.26X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.01X. It is also above the sector’s forward-12-month P/E of 24.77X.In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 201.26X and as low as 10.59X, with the median being 15.85X, as the charts below indicate.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioForward 12-Month P/E Ratio3 Computer-Storage Devices Stocks to Add to WatchlistNetApp: NetApp’s remains well-poised to gain from data-driven digital and cloud transformations. Frequent product launches and secular trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing bodes well. Extensive cost-discipline measures and dividend and share repurchase activity are noteworthy. NetApp recently announced a new additional $1-billion share repurchase authorization.NetApp expects fiscal 2024 revenues to decline in the low-to-mid single digits range on a year-over-year basis. Weakening IT spending environment and cloud cost optimization amid macroeconomic turbulence weigh on the performance along with forex volatility. Management believes that these are temporary headwinds and expects IT spending to rebound in time.NetApp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings for the company improved by a cent to $5.49 per share in the past seven days. Its long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 8.8%.Price and Consensus: NTAPPure Storage: Pure Storage’s performance is gaining from continued momentum in subscription services’ revenues. Subscription revenues are gaining from the robust adoption of Evergreen subscription services. The company is likely to benefit from the growing demand for its FlashArray and FlashBlade businesses. Frequent product launches and an increasing customer base are tailwinds. PSTG added more than 276 customers in the last reported quarter. The company’s customer base has more than 11,500 customers and represents 58% of Fortune 500 companies.The company reiterated its revenue guidance for fiscal 2024. Amid current macroeconomic weakness, Pure Storage expects revenues to grow in the range of mid-to-high single digits on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 15%.Shares of PSTG, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, have gained 23.3% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings for the company improved by 1 cent to $1.32 per share in the past seven days. Its long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 15.2%.Price and Consensus: PSTGTeradata: Teradata’s performance is gaining from solid growth in public cloud annual recurring revenues.

IDXX is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the performance of the company’s CAG (Companion Animal Group) arm. In the first quarter, key execution metrics remained strong globally, reflecting premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. However, mounting expenses and a negative foreign currency impact are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 23.5% against the 1% rise of the industry and a 3.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $39.03 billion. IDEXX has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 17.3% compared with the industry’s 14.4%. IDXX’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 5.15%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesCAG Continues to Perform Well: IDEXX registered stellar revenue growth within the CAG segment in the first quarter. CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenue growth was supported by global net price gains in the 8%-9% range, consistent with the company’s expectations. Within the United States, new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level resulted in robust volume growth.Internationally, recurring revenue gains were driven by strong IDEXX execution, higher net price realization, sustained new business gains and a double-digit expansion of the premium instrument installed base.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrong Global Performance: Internationally, IDEXX achieved strong organic revenue growth across its modalities in the first quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues witnessed double-digit gains in the United States and international regions.Consumable gains were supported by year-over-year growth in the global premium instrument installed base. This reflected double-digit increases across the Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms.Story continuesThe quality of CAG premium instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflecting 7% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. The company’s newest hematology analyzer, ProCyte One held its momentum globally, reflecting a global installed base that more than doubled over the last year.The global expansion of rapid assay organic revenues was driven by solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization in the United States. Global organic lab revenues registered mid-single-digit growth in international regions.Solid Execution of Growth Strategy Drives Q1 Performance: IDEXX’s first-quarter top line was driven by the continued solid demand for veterinary services and benefits from strong IDEXX execution. The company sustained another record quarter for global premium instrument placements led by its commercial teams. We are encouraged to see strong growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts globally, driving solid EVI achievements.Commercial execution is supported by the multiplier benefits that flow from IDEXX innovations, as evidenced by the success of ProCyte One. For IDEXX, commercial expansion remains an important early step for the international strategy, supporting recent efforts to optimize the reference lab network, roll out highly relevant products like ProCyte One and drive the adoption of software tools like the cloud-based diagnostic portal, VetConnect PLUS.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: The majority of IDXX’s consolidated revenues are derived from the sale of products in international markets. Thus, the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact on the company’s revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and profits from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally.Weak Solvency &amp; Capital Structure: At the first quarter-end, IDEXX had  total debt of $771.3 million, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents of $111.4 million.IDEXX’s total debt-to-capital of 47.8% stands at a moderately high level right now. The industry’s debt-to-capital of 30.9% stands lower than the company.Estimate TrendIDEXX has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $9.57 to $9.65 in the past 60 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.66 billion.

268,f4ff277a-fbae-34e6-ab27-daf3f3b241bb,PNR,2023-06-07,Pentair's (NYSE:PNR) three-year earnings growth trails the 15% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pentairs-nyse-pnr-three-earnings-105606304.html,1686135366,STORY,['PNR'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR) shareholders have seen the share price rise 46% over three years, well in excess of the market return (29%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 18% in the last year , including dividends .Since the stock has added US$308m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Pentair There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Pentair was able to grow its EPS at 9.7% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Pentair's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Pentair's TSR for the last 3 years was 53%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Pentair has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 18% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 5.73%.Coming into today, shares of the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum had lost 4.89% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 5.29%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.56%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Mondelez as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Mondelez is projected to report earnings of $0.70 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 4.48%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.17 billion, up 12.3% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.20 per share and revenue of $35.34 billion. These totals would mark changes of +8.47% and +12.2%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Mondelez. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

270,6e192996-e760-3aa3-bf74-27aa35ee9be0,OXY,2023-06-07,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-occidental-petroleum-130011622.html,1686056411,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has gained 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -63% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -45.1%. This estimate has changed -11.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.28 indicates a change of +22.4% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $7.44 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -30.7%. The $30.37 billion and $31.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.1% and +4.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $7.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.9%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.68%. The EPS surprise was -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $1.75.Our TakeHealthEquity exited first-quarter fiscal 2024 with better-than-expected results. The company witnessed solid top-line and bottom-line performances in the reported quarter. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. Solid growth in HSAs also drove the top line. The solid uptick in total HSA assets in the reported quarter is promising. The expansion of both margins also bodes well. The company raising its revenue and adjusted EPS outlook for the fiscal year raises our optimism.However, continued inflationary pressure leading to higher costs and wage inflation issues does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksHealthEquity currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Hologic, Inc.

272,fde47a9e-a0c4-3e69-b603-90a7fb4002eb,BSX,2023-06-07,Here's Why You Should Hold Integer Holdings (ITGR) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-integer-holdings-145600061.html,1686063360,STORY,"['ITGR', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its improving non-medical sales. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continue to concern the company.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 7.5% compared with a 1.3% rise of the industry it belongs to and the S&amp;P 500 composite’s growth of 3.1%.The renowned medical device outsource manufacturer has a market capitalization of $2.75 billion. The company projects 11.9% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Integer Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 1.7%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Improving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the first quarter of 2023, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 63.4% year over year. The upside was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and continued supplier delivery recovery.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust first-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were also recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin bodes well for the stock.DownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could adversely affect its operating results.Estimate TrendInteger Holdings is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for the current year. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.7% north to $4.15 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $367 million, suggesting a 4.8% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

The staffing shortage is severe enough that hospitals have closed more than 4,300 beds, and at times, have been forced to stop accepting patients in non-emergency departments.In Germany, 22,000 nursing positions are vacant (compared to 3,900 positions five years ago) and 57 per cent of hospitals report having to restrict services due to staff shortages.In Spain, the shortage has meant that nurses currently treat double and sometimes triple the number of patients recommended by the European Union.Unfortunately, the data suggests that resolution is nowhere in sight; the World Health Organization projects a worldwide workforce shortage in 2030 of some 15 million healthcare workers.Interestingly enough, I've noticed that when we business leaders wring our hands over the crisis, we tend to speak about it foremost in economic terms.Amid all the necessary business talk, I implore us to not lose sight of our true focus: the real-world impact this shortage is having on patient care.Let me tell you about the impact on one such patient: my sister, Sylvie.View the full original content hereCourtesy of Health Tech World onlineView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/boston-scientificEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/759538/Meeting-the-Staff-Shortage-Crisis-With-Digital-Solutions]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth. In this article, we will discuss top dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Top 16 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned the holdings of 943 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked the top 16 dividend stocks which are most popular among these funds as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

These stakes have a consolidated value of $4.5 billion.15. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based company that specializes in financial software. In fiscal Q3 2023, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion during the same period last year. At the end of April 2023, the company had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $2.8 billion last year.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), one of the best dividend stocks on our list, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. The company maintains a 10-year streak of consistent dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 0.74%.Following the company's recent earnings beat, Street analysts are placing positive ratings on ntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). In May, both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America raised their price targets on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) to $525 and $500, respectively.At the end of Q1 2023, 86 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), worth over $5.2 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Durable Capital Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that mainly provides commercial banking and investing services to its consumers. In May, Raymond James upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $63 price target, highlighting the company's balance sheet and stable net interest margin.On April 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield stands at around 1.92%.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) saw a spike in hedge fund positions in Q1 2023, as 87 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company with an aggregate value of $4 billion, up from 74 in the previous quarter.RiverPark Advisors mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products for a wide range of industries. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.48%.

Its revenue for the quarter came in at $7.2 billion.In May, SVB Securities presented a bullish stance on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) as the firm initiated its coverage on the stock with an Outperform rating and a $300 price target. The firm highlighted the company's diversified businesses and a leading profitability profile.At the end of the first quarter, 90 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), up from 88 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $5.6 billion.Madison Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has been trading lower since it reported fourth quarter earnings in January. The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare. The claw back payment period goes back to 2011.”12. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based private banking company that specializes in financial information and analytics. On May 3, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. It has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 50 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.01%.In the first quarter of 2023, S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) with an Overweight rating and a $415 price target. The firm highlighted the company's organic revenue growth and margin expansion.As of the close of Q1 2023, 90 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), with a total value of over $7.3 billion.Here is what Wedgewood Partners has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter.“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based investment bank and financial services company.

Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an integrated healthcare benefits company uniquely positioned to address rising healthcare costs for its customers, due to its vertical integration, size, and scale. The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

281,458bdd04-542e-312a-af62-b4c678a525f6,WM,2023-06-07,25 Dirtiest Cities in the U.S.,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-dirtiest-cities-u-125855336.html,1686056335,STORY,['WM'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 dirtiest cities in the U.S. You can skip our discussion and methodology details, head on over to 5 Dirtiest Cities in the U.S. The growth in industrialization and the convenience of countless products have significantly improved modern day living standards. More people have sufficient calories available to them, as well as affordable clothing and other amenities that were reserved for the rich of the past. However, at the same time, simple inventions for convenience, such as plastic bags, have created problems of their own - the biggest of which is trash and pollution.In fact, plastic bags are some of the most passively dangerous objects invented by mankind. Since they are made from artificial raw materials, they do not decompose in the environment like other organic products. Instead, a plastic bag breaks down into smaller pieces, as part of a process called photodegradation which can take as much as two decades. This process leads to the production of microplastics, which then pose a hazard to animals who eat them. While 20 years is a long time, it is by far the shortest for the degradation of the variety of commonly used items. Data from the World Wildlife Fund Inc. (WWF) shows that while a plastic bag has a degradation life of twenty years, the worst offenders are diapers, coffee pods, and toothbrushes - all of which take a stunning 500 years to meet their end.At the same time, increasing global population and urbanization are resulting in larger amounts of trash polluting the planet as well. Estimates from the World Bank suggest that the world is set to generate more than a billion tons of additional waste by 2050 over 2018 levels. The organization's What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050 report shows that the world generated two billion tons of waste in 2016, and this is set to grow 70% by 2050 to sit at 3.4 billion tons. Additionally, and just as the case has been with greenhouse gas emissions, high income countries generate the highest percentage (34%) of the waste, with three North American countries - namely the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda - being the worst offenders and generating 2.21 kilograms per capita in waste daily on average and a maximum of 4.54 kg/capita/day. Adding to this, data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that the U.S. ranks lowest globally in percentage terms of plastic recycling, but high in levels of incineration.Story continuesBuilding on this, the growing problem of trash has also created massive economic opportunities in cleaning up American cities. Coupled with technology, this has led to smart and innovative concepts such as smart waste bins, waste level sensors in dumpsters, kiosks and bins for electronic waste, and artificial intelligence powered robots. And one city, despite the flak that it gets for high levels of pollution, is New York City. New York has one of the largest trash and sanitation departments in the world, and the city is using smart garbage bins developed by Big Belly Inc of the neighboring Massachusetts. These bins use solar power and sensors to detect whether they are full or smelly - allowing trash collectors to optimize their collection routes using these alerts. At the same, the bins have the added benefit of being free WiFi hotspots for anyone that might need them. The bins have been a success if we believe data from Big Belly. The firm, citing the example of Times Square, explains that the bins have improved waste collection by 40% and reduced the time spent in collecting the bins by 50%.Delving deeper into the use of technology to keep the dirtiest American cities clean, other cities are tackling their trash problems through the help of robotics. One such city is Sarasota, Florida where Single Stream Recyclers (SSR) is using an AI powered robot from AMP Robotics to sort food and beverage cartons for recycling. Another city that has tested a robot for trash collection is San Francisco, where the AI powered robot called Trashbot sorts recyclable items from non recyclable ones. Finally, trash interceptors have been quite a success in Baltimore, where they have kept thousands of pounds of trash from entering the harbor.Finally, on a larger scale, executives of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) explained how technology is helping them optimize their waste collection during the firm's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:I don’t know that we’re hearing a lot about tech because I’m just not — I think they’re more focused on how do they keep drivers on the road. We are hearing that, and some of the companies that we’ve acquired are showing double the turnover that we’re showing. It’s why we think there’s an opportunity for us to take share — continue to take share, first, because I think the customer service product that we are providing is superior. When you are able to hold a lot of your drivers, it makes a big difference in that customer lifetime value proposition. So, we are hearing that, that turnover has become a consistent and recurring problem for a lot of those companies. I think the other thing that I would like to mention too is as we think about drivers, why it’s imperative that we bring technology to this labor pool.It’s a shrinking labor pool. We’ve talked about it a lot. The Gen Z doesn’t want to drive trucks the way a Baby Boomer or Gen X did. So, how do we take advantage of that and the way we take advantage of it is by bringing technology to squeeze 5%, 10% maybe even 15% optimization out. And that’s exactly what we’re doing in building an optimization tool that understands absolutely the best route to take. It understands things like location of carts. We finally now know where all of our assets are. It understands the expertise of drivers. I mean, there’s a whole bunch of factors that go into a full optimization. And I guarantee there’s not anybody else out there that’s able to do that. It is not inexpensive to optimize that. But once we optimize it, then we become less reliant on labor.And it’s a labor-intensive business, and we have 25% turnover in those driver ranks. How do I take advantage of that? And it’s got to be through technology.Waste Management isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, however, you can find out the best waste management stocks to buy here.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13.

The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare.

(NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based investment bank and financial services company.

Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.U.S. stock index futures rose on June 1 after the House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the nation's debt ceiling. Investors eagerly awaited labor market data for further assessment. The bill, aiming to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, garnered bipartisan support and now moves to the Senate for enactment before a Monday deadline, crucial to prevent a government funding shortfall. European equities rebounded, driven by improved market sentiment, with media, banking, and mining sectors leading gains while real estate lagged. Bloomberg reported a larger-than-expected drop in underlying inflation in the eurozone, but it's unlikely to deter the European Central Bank from pursuing interest rate increases.According to a report from Bloomberg, Federal Reserve officials are conveying their plans to maintain the current interest rates throughout the month of June. However, they also leave the door open for future rate hikes. This guidance is being provided to influence market expectations and prepare for an upcoming crucial employment report. Governor Philip Jefferson, known for his centrist stance and nominated for the vice chair position, recently said that the decision to hold rates steady allows policymakers to assess the available data carefully. It also provides flexibility for potential tightening measures if warranted. Governor Jefferson's alignment with Chair Jerome Powell's approach further solidifies the message of a patient and data-driven approach to monetary policy. The Fed's communication strategy aims to provide transparency and stability in the face of ongoing economic uncertainties.A recent report from Bloomberg highlights a discernible shift in global investor sentiment, with dissatisfaction mounting over China's stock market performance. As a result, other major markets in Asia are increasingly catching the attention of investors as more appealing alternatives. This divergence in performance has become more pronounced in recent times, with a prominent Chinese stock index experiencing a significant 20% decline from its recent peak. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi index has been showing promising signs of a bull market, while stock benchmarks in India have been steadily approaching record highs. Moreover, Japanese stocks reached an impressive three-decade high earlier in May, further highlighting the attractiveness of Asian markets beyond China. Taiwan, too, continues to outperform many other global stock markets. The relative strength and resilience of these markets compared to China's equity market have sparked interest among global investors seeking alternative investment opportunities.Story continuesThis shift in sentiment suggests a growing recognition of the potential for higher returns and more favorable risk-reward profiles in these Asian markets. The economic growth and stability exhibited by countries such as South Korea, India, Japan, and Taiwan have contributed to their appeal. As investors reassess their strategies and diversify their portfolios, these Asian markets emerge as attractive destinations for capital allocation. The ongoing performance disparity between China and other Asian markets serves as a reminder that regional dynamics and individual market characteristics play a significant role in investment decisions. It also underscores the need for a nuanced approach to global investing, taking into account the unique opportunities and risks presented by different markets within the broader Asian region.Meanwhile, several companies, including Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), were also on the list of 10 stocks receiving price-target hikes from analysts.

(NYSE:LOW) from $228 to $237 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst acknowledges that the home center industry is currently facing challenges, as home price appreciation, which has traditionally been a significant macro metric, has declined year over year for three consecutive months. However, DA Davidson highlights that Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is consistently narrowing the gap with Home Depot (HD) across key metrics. As a result, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) stock price has outperformed for the sixth consecutive year.09. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Upside Potential: 4.61%Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz has increased the firm's price target for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $340 from $325 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares.

Mizuho believes these opportunities, including significant monetization of generative AI, are greater than many currently recognize.Ariel Global Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enterprise software provider, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also traded higher in the period alongside the investor enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence. Microsoft is well positioned as this new technology advances given its large investment in Open AI, the parent company of ChatGPT. Looking ahead, we continue to like Microsoft’s solid fundamentals, competitive positioning and long-term business outlook. We anchor on the company driving value creation by capitalizing on a broad and deep set of opportunities, most notably within Azure, its hybrid cloud infrastructure. The platform continues to demonstrate share gains and strong multi-year purchase intent as enterprises transition to cloud based platforms.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is a software company headquartered in Mountain View, California. The firm provides products to enable firms to manage their account, run payroll, and conduct other operations.

(NASDAQ:INTU) from $462 to $485 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. On May 24, the analyst noted that the company's Consumer segment tax growth is tracking approximately four points lower than expected. The lower growth is primarily attributed to unexpected share loss in the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) channel, assumed from exiting stimulus filers. Despite this, BMO acknowledges the strength of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) small business franchise, the ongoing improvement in Mailchimp, and the product development in B2B payments.

(NYSE:BLDR) from $150 to $160 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst's research note, the investment community is not fully appreciating the positive impact of low home inventory on new construction and its implications for builders and building products. Although the housing market is facing challenges, new construction is showing improvement and is in a much stronger position. While Barclays maintains a cautious stance on building products overall, it is more positive for companies that are well-positioned to benefit from the growth in new residential construction. As a result, Corning has been upgraded to Overweight, while SiteOne Landscape Supply has been downgraded to Underweight. The firm has also raised earnings estimates and price targets for homebuilders and residential distributors.Bonhoeffer Capital Management made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“One of our holdings in the distribution theme is Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), a clustered building products distribution firm. BFS’s growth model is through same-store sales growth (6% per year based upon increased home sales of 1.5 million units from 1.0 million units) and synergistic M&amp;A (4% per year). These are enhanced by opportunistic operational leverage from scale and share repurchases (5% annual growth). Over the past five years, BFS’s net income margins are up from 2% to 13%, with a 3x increase in revenues. These factors should lead to about a 16% EPS growth going forward. BFS has had 82% EPS growth over the past five years. Since August 2021, BFS has repurchased 34% of its common stock.The real driver is the pace at which new home and other construction rebounds from the interest rate shock of the last 18 months. We have used analyst estimates for revenue and free cash flow/earnings for the next two years and longer-term growth assumptions described above. We have also assumed 50% of free cash flow will be used for repurchases (and this may be conservative based upon the past 18 months’ repurchase levels).…” (Click here to read the full text)06. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Upside Potential: 8.43%Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has faced challenges due to increased competition and difficulties sustaining subscription growth.

This sheet level was made to safeguard high-risk products such as cookware, canned foods, power tools and others.JCI’s AM metal sheet labels particularly secure products with metal surfaces. This solves a major problem faced by retailers and thus enables them to protect stocks that couldn’t be protected earlier. These magnetic levels also lessen some of the risks associated with carrying these goods. The JCI solution further reduces the requirement of labor needed for tagging and monitoring the products, which in turn allows retailers to achieve operational improvement.Along with AM metal sheet labels, JCI has come up with two other products to prevent the growing retail crime rate. The company has expanded its magnetic InFuzion hard tag family. This product features an ink version for visual deterrence and a wide-gap version for thicker items and footwear which reduces tagging and checkout times along with self-checkout integration capabilities.

LYB announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Technip Energies and Chevron Phillips Chemical to potentially design, build, and operate a demonstration unit based on Technip Energies' electric steam cracking furnace technology (eFurnace by T.EN). Later this year, a collaborative development agreement is expected to be signed.This innovative eFurnace technology is expected to enable LyondellBasell to use renewable electricity as a heat source for the olefins cracking process in the future, significantly lowering its olefins production process' greenhouse gas footprint and assisting the company in meeting its ambitious climate targets.The construction of the demonstration unit, which would be the first for LyondellBasell, is an important step in the development of eFurnace technology and a necessary prerequisite for the potential future construction of a full-scale unit. It will allow the company to test the technology and demonstrate that continuous olefin production using electricity as a heat source is feasible.Due to its operational excellence, feedstock flexibility, and electric grid infrastructure, proximity to the other MOU participants, and access to knowledge at the company's Houston Technology Center, the LyondellBasell Channelview facility provides an ideal setting for the demonstration unit. The three parties intend to form a cooperative development team to help with project implementation.Shares of LYB have lost 20.1% over the past year compared with the 10.3% decline of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its first-quarter call, said that it anticipates a slight increase in global demand driven by usual seasonal trends. The demand for transportation fuels is expected to increase over the summer, supporting oxyfuels and refining margins. Delays at the beginning of industry-wide capacity expansions for polyethylene in North America are likely to lower new market supply and support polyethylene margins.  In order to keep pace with the market expectation, LyondellBasell estimates operating Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets at 80% and modestly raises global olefins and polyolefins operating rates to 85%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance,  and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Dividends can be a significant component of hedge funds’ overall investment strategy because of income generation, risk mitigation, and value investing. In addition to this, dividend growth can lead to potential capital gains, especially when it is accompanied by an increase in the stock price. For instance, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased 400 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in 1994 for $1.3 billion, a value which has now increased to $25 billion. The ""hedge fund"" is expected to generate over $5.7 billion in cash this year, with dividends representing most of it, as mentioned in our article Warren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks.Last year’s high inflationary environment turned investors’ attention toward dividend stocks as they have historically proved their resilience during clampdowns. Dividend stocks are generally defensive in nature and can provide a potential hedge against inflation. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Fidelity Investments which revealed that dividends represented a significant percentage of the market’s returns during the high inflationary decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s. Inflation in these decades averaged above 5% and total returns were below 10%.Dividend stocks not only remained prominent during periods of high inflation, but dividends have also contributed a substantial portion of the total returns of the US stock market over extended periods. Since 1930, dividend stocks have accounted for nearly 40% of the stock market’s overall return. Their historical performance, coupled with positive investor sentiment, resulted in the growth of dividend payments over the years. Global dividends rose 12% in the first quarter of 2023, reaching their record high of $327 billion, according to a report by Janus Henderson Investors.Story continuesWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors pay attention to dividend yields and the dividend history of the respective company. Companies that consistently increase their dividends over time demonstrate financial strength, stability, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their consistent dividend growth. In this article, we will discuss top dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Top 16 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned the holdings of 943 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked the top 16 dividend stocks which are most popular among these funds as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational pharmaceutical industry company.

These stakes have a consolidated value of $4.5 billion.15. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based company that specializes in financial software. In fiscal Q3 2023, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion during the same period last year. At the end of April 2023, the company had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $2.8 billion last year.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), one of the best dividend stocks on our list, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. The company maintains a 10-year streak of consistent dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 0.74%.Following the company's recent earnings beat, Street analysts are placing positive ratings on ntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). In May, both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America raised their price targets on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) to $525 and $500, respectively.At the end of Q1 2023, 86 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), worth over $5.2 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Durable Capital Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that mainly provides commercial banking and investing services to its consumers. In May, Raymond James upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $63 price target, highlighting the company's balance sheet and stable net interest margin.On April 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield stands at around 1.92%.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) saw a spike in hedge fund positions in Q1 2023, as 87 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company with an aggregate value of $4 billion, up from 74 in the previous quarter.RiverPark Advisors mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.”13. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products for a wide range of industries. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.48%. It has been raising its dividends consistently for the past nine years.One of the best dividend stocks on our list, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) reported a strong cash position in the first quarter of 2023. The company's operating cash flow came in at $1.9 billion and it generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Its revenue for the quarter came in at $7.2 billion.In May, SVB Securities presented a bullish stance on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) as the firm initiated its coverage on the stock with an Outperform rating and a $300 price target. The firm highlighted the company's diversified businesses and a leading profitability profile.At the end of the first quarter, 90 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), up from 88 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $5.6 billion.Madison Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has been trading lower since it reported fourth quarter earnings in January. The company lowered Covid-19 related sales for 2023 from $500 million to $150 million as pharmaceutical companies are switching their focus away from pandemic vaccines and therapeutics to the research and development of new drugs. Danaher’s pharmaceutical customers will be working through existing inventory before starting to order new products. We remain confident in Danaher’s strong competitive position providing innovative products to Life Science companies. Healthcare insurance stocks have been weak due to a ruling by CMS (Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) in late January where claw back payments totaling $4.7 billion were due from insurers that overcharged Medicare. The claw back payment period goes back to 2011.”12. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) was a bottom contributor to portfolio performance during the quarter. Adjusted revenue declined -5%, mostly driven by the decline in ratings revenues which is lapping strong one-year and two-year comparisons. During 2022, the Company closed on its acquisition of IHS Markit which has diversified its revenue streams into new, but high-margin business lines. The Company’s new corporate structure should allow for attractive growth, even if fixed income issuance trends stay at stall-speeds for the next few quarters.”11. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”7.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company’s operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry. While these concerns have impacted UnitedHealth in the near-term, we believe company fundamentals remain intact given its large scale business model, competitive advantages, and medium to long- term growth prospects.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure.

Why? Turns out the majority of the population (71%) suffer from a fear of bugs2 – or what Zevo dubs ""bugxiety.""Procter &amp; Gamble’s (NYSE: PG) Zevo recently conducted a 2023 survey to learn more about consumer attitude toward bugs and how they respond to being around the little critters. Ready for some interesting findings?3More Americans rated their anxiety of bugs (46%) higher than their anxiety of getting fired (44%)Fourteen percent of Americans said they wouldn’t marry someone who suffered from bugxietyAnd there are even a handful of people who confessed to crashing their car to escape from bugs!Despite the high number of Americans with bugxiety, most are in a reactive mode when it comes to bugs.

""Bugs are inevitable, especially in the summer months, but our best-selling Flying Insect Trap continuously attracts and eliminates a variety of flying insects without disrupting your daily life – and helps you achieve a whole new level of clean and calm.""Given fear and stress are commonly associated with bugs instead of the zen you can get from Zevo, it is no surprise that bugs impact everyday life. Many respondents shared their extreme reactions to spotting bugs at home and even at work. Survey respondents admitted*:""I've ran down the street screaming at the top of my lungs, looking like a fool in front of a lot of people."" – 34 year old male""I would not go back into my office at work (because I saw a roach) until a coworker showed me the corpse of that bug."" – 49 year old femaleStory continuesFor those who suffer from bugxiety, bugs aren’t just ""bugging"" them. Forty-eight percent of Americans say it directly affects their daily life in more ways than one.4 For example, 1 in 3 Americans thought about burning their home after finding bugs.5 Crazy, right? However, there are effortless alternatives to help those suffering from bugxiety feel some relief and achieve a whole new level of calm. No need to react with fear or stress (or practice relaxation techniques!): just plug or spray and walk away.So how can Zevo help Americans’ stress fade when bugs invade without having to touch the creepy crawlies?Flying Insect Trap: Great for those who can’t stand flying annoyances, Zevo’s Flying Insect Trap uses a special blue &amp; UV light system to attract and trap flying insects (e.g., house flies, fruit flies and gnats) on a strong adhesive pad, which can be easily removed and disposed of via a pull tab.On-Body Mosquito + Tick Repellent: New On-Body repellent provides odorless, non-sticky and complete protection against mosquitos and ticks for up to 8 hours, so you can enjoy the outdoors unbothered by bugs and without the ick of traditional bug sprays.Insect Killer Spray: For those who freak out when they see creepy-crawly pests, Zevo Insect Killer Sprays offer complete protection against spiders, roaches, ants and more.

This has lifted SL Green's year-to-date office leasing volume to more than 800,000 square feet, with an office leasing pipeline exceeding one million square feet.One standout transaction saw a world-leading sovereign wealth fund renew and expand its lease at 280 Park Avenue. The tenant signed a 15-year renewal and expansion lease covering 99,568 square feet, renewing its hold of 49,851 square feet on the entire 9th floor and expanding into 49,717 square feet to include the full 10th floor.Also at 245 Park Avenue, two additional leases totaling 86,840 square feet were inked, contributing to the quarter's impressive statistics.At 245 Park Avenue, EQT Partners, a prominent Swedish private equity firm, signed a new 15-year lease for more than 76,000 square feet on the 33rd and 34th floors. Meanwhile, Angelo Gordon, a global alternative investment manager specializing in real estate, expanded its lease by 10,636 square feet on the 23rd floor.Stone Point Capital, LLC also upped its footprint, taking an additional 12,692 square feet on the 50th floor at One Vanderbilt Avenue. This increased its total commitment to 28,874 square feet.SL Green's executive vice president, director of Leasing and Real Property, Steven Durels, expressed optimism, noting that ""leasing velocity continues to improve."" According to Durels, “Buildings that are located near public transportation, are well amenitized, that provide healthy work environments and are managed by high-quality, well capitalized operators are realizing leasing success.”  SL Green is demonstrating an encouraging leasing performance in 2023, underlining its strength as New York City's top office landlord. This trend highlights the resilience of the NYC commercial real estate market and SL Green's strategic position within it.Moreover, SLG’s opportunistic investment policy and solid balance sheet strength position it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. However, the choppy office market environment and high-interest rates remain concerns.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past month.

Horton's estimated fair value is US$230 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityD.R. Horton's US$115 share price signals that it might be 50% undervalued The US$123 analyst price target for DHI is 46% less than our estimate of fair valueIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$3.49bUS$2.91bUS$3.26bUS$5.43bUS$6.09bUS$6.64bUS$7.11bUS$7.51bUS$7.84bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 12.12%Est @ 9.12%Est @ 7.02%Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.2% US$3.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$3.5kUS$3.6kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.2%– 2.1%) = US$112bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$112b÷ ( 1 + 9.2%)10= US$46bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$78b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$115, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at D.R. Horton as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.202. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for D.R. HortonStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Consumer Durables industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Durables market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For D.R.

302,ccb96b20-41b7-3529-b0ff-62facc9aca55,DHI,2023-06-07,4 Solid Stocks to Buy on a Jump in Construction Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-solid-stocks-buy-jump-124000047.html,1686055200,STORY,"['DHI', 'MTH', 'BZH', 'KBH']","[Spending on construction projects has been on a steady rise over the past couple of months. This comes despite rising prices, with inflation still at multi-year highs. However, inflation has started showing signs of easing, and expectations are high among investors that the Fed might finally pause hiking interest rates in its June meeting.The latest data from the Commerce Department shows that construction spending increased in April for the second straight month. The jump was primarily driven by spending on private projects. This comes as homebuilding data showed that home prices have been steadily falling, leading to a rise in sales of new homes. Against this backdrop, stocks like KB Home KBH, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and Meritage Homes Corporation MTH are likely to benefit.Construction Spending ReboundsThe Commerce Department said on Jun 1 that spending on construction projects in the United States jumped a solid 1.2% in April, which came in above the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%. Construction spending rose 0.3% in March.On a year-over-year basis, construction spending rose 7.2% in April. Spending on private construction projects jumped 1.3%. Spending on private nonresidential projects like gas and oil well drilling grew 2.4%.The homebuilding industry, which has suffered the most owing to the Fed’s steep rate hikes in its bid to tame soaring inflation, has also been showing a steady rebound as spending on residential construction increased 0.5%. Also, spending on outlays on multi-family housing projects rose 0.6% in May.Also, spending on public construction projects climbed 1.1% in May.The homebuilding industry helped the construction sector during the peak of the pandemic when home sales hit record highs. However, sales slowed as the Fed stepped in with its aggressive interest rate hike policy to curb multi-year high inflation.Higher interest rates directly impacted home sales as mortgage rates soared, compelling buyers to put a halt to their plans of purchasing new homes.Story continuesHowever, inflation has lately shown signs of easing and spending on residential projects has been picking up.The Commerce Department said last month that new home sales jumped to a 13-month high in April. New home sales rose 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 683,000 units, the highest level since 2022.New home sales serve as a leading indicator of the housing market because they are recorded at the time of contract signing.  Economists had predicted new home sales to fall to a rate of 665,000. Year over year, new home sales increased 11.8% in April.This came as separate data showed that permits for future single-family homes also rose in April, while confidence among homebuilders, which had hit rock bottom, rebounded to a 10-month high in May.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in spending on construction projects. We narrowed down our search to four such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.KB Home is a well-known homebuilder in the United States and one of the largest in the state.  KBH’s Homebuilding operations include building and designing homes that cater to first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers on acquired or developed lands.

Air travel continues to be particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand is also bouncing back nicely. Low fuel costs represent another tailwind for airline stocks.Driven by the abovementioned positives, investors interested in the industry would do well to keep stocks like American Airlines, Copa Holdings and Allegiant Travel Company on their radar.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry includes players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air-travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is a positive too.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesBuoyant Air Traffic Scenario: The stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge positive for the industry, which was one of the worst-hit industries in the peak COVID-19 period. People are again resorting to air travel with the resumption of normal activities. Airline stocks are likely to continue flying high with the summer travel season fast approaching when air-travel demand is likely to swell. Per Airlines for America, U.S. airlines are anticipated to carry 257 million passengers from Jun 1 to Aug 31, 2023. The projection is at an all-time high.Story continuesOwing to the buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand, the International Air Transport Association or IATA has doubled its current-year profitability (net) forecast for the industry to $9.8 billion from $4.7 billion. The top line in 2023 is now anticipated to be $803 billion compared with the previous estimate of $779 billion. The revised revenue forecast indicates a 9.7% increase from the 2022 actuals. Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of this rosy projection. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are now anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue forecast indicates a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals.Declining Fuel Costs: The southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of industry participants. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. Notably, oil price declined 5.7% in the January-March period of 2023. Per IATA, the average jet fuel cost is expected to be $98.5 per barrel in 2023 (earlier forecast was $111.9 per barrel).High Labor Costs: Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Per IATA, total expenses are expected to be $781 billion in 2023. The cost forecast indicates an 8.1% increase from the 2022 actuals. With expenses on fuel moving south, costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to escalated labor costs. Moreover, with U.S. airlines grappling with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This will result in an increase in labor costs.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 26-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #49, which places it in the top 20% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for 2023 has moved up 38.9% since September 2022.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add or retain in your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has declined 4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite’s rise of 4.2%. The broader sector has declined 5.5% in the said time frame.Valuation PictureThe price/sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.68X. It is also below the sector’s forward-12-month P/S of 1.52X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.02X, as low as 0.33X and at the median of 0.65X.3 Stocks to Keep a Tab onCopa Holdings, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is benefiting from an improvement in air-travel demand.

Average fuel cost per gallon is now expected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 (earlier guidance: $2.65-$2.75).

Say, for example, that you're married. If you wear a wedding ring, that presents a sign to others. If you don't, strangers may make a quick (and potentially inaccurate) assumption about your relationship status.Now, imagine being a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. What assumptions might others make if they don't know you, but you come out? And how can community allies create safer, more inclusive spaces?For Yvonne Gonzalez, a senior associate in communications at Principal®, the latter opportunity came when a co-worker asked if she had a partner or not. It's an ordinary-enough question asked in a more expansive way. It gave Gonzalez an inclusive opening to talk about her girlfriend of six years. ""You don't really know how people out in the world are going to respond, and if you're a member of a marginalized community, you might not be able to say who you are,"" she says. ""At Principal, I've felt connected and comfortable.""Challenges to safetySafety and connections-not just during Pride month in June but beyond-have become even more important of late. In 2023 alone, nearly 500 anti-LGBTQIA+ bills were proposed or passed, targeting everything from gender information on birth certificates to nondiscrimination protection and access to certain books.[1]The LGBTQIA+ community also faces additional barriers, including legal impediments, to financial security. For example, 37% of LGBTQIA+ households have difficulty paying for usual household expenses, versus 26% of non-LGBTQIA+ adults.[2] Some employers still don't offer health insurance to same-sex spouses.[3] More than one in four transgender people reported losing a job due to bias.[4] Same-sex couples that decide to pursue parenthood generally experience higher medical and legal fees throughout the process.[5]Story continuesFears for the futureCal Solverson, who identifies as transgender/non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, describes coming out as a never-ending process.

""When I came out as trans, I finally had the vocabulary I was missing my entire life to understand myself,"" says Solverson, a plan reporting specialist at Principal.Many of the assumptions that people take for granted-pronouns, for example-aren't ones that Solverson can rely on. ""I know I need to say ‘Hi, my name is Cal, I use they/them pronouns' to protect myself and help people address me correctly,"" they say.Anti-trans legislation enacted in 2023 in Iowa, Solverson's home and the Principal headquarters, has unmoored them even more. ""Coming out as trans was a lot scarier than coming out as gay because I felt like being gay was starting to become acceptable in society-and I don't necessarily feel the same way about being trans, especially recently,"" Solverson says.Inclusion in progressPrincipal has a long history of supporting the LGBTQIA+ community. That includes:Advocating in 2006 for legislation to expand Iowa's Civil Rights Act to include gender identity and sexual orientation as protected classes, in addition to race, sex, age, national origin, creed, religion, and disability status. The legislation was signed into law on the Principal campus.Achieving a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Equality Index every year since 2016.Being named the 2022 Forbes list of Best Employers for Diversity.Signing on to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Signatory and Business Coalition for the Equality Act.Creating a supplier diversity program to actively support and facilitate the purchase of products and services from businesses owned or operated by individuals representing people of color, women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, veterans, or individuals with different abilities.In recent years, Principal has also committed to addressing and updating its diversity, equity, and inclusion approach. That includes identifying and hiring champions and advocates at every leadership level, such as a chief inclusion officer.That doesn't mean the work is done, though. ""It's hard to navigate being queer, to make people see me for who I am and understand the implications that come with my identity,"" Solverson says.Celebrating history, searching for joyOne workplace connection Solverson relies on is the Principal LGBTQIA+ employee resource group; its members continue to grapple with the legislative landscape, support one another, and remind allies of their critical role. ""The LGBTQIA+ ERG is one of the most intersectional communities-we get to hear about different people with different identities outside of being LGBTQIA+ and how they navigate queerness at the same time,"" Solverson says.How to improve your allyshipAsking these questions of members of the LGBTQIA+ community can help:June, and with it Pride month, arrives for Gonzalez and Solverson at a somber moment. ""A lot of us don't feel safe,"" Gonzalez says. ""Not being yourself is draining, and to me, Pride means being able to celebrate yourself and be who you are safely.""But there is also joy to be found. ""I want to celebrate those who made sure I could celebrate in the first place as a form of thanks,"" Solverson says. ""Thanks for putting your lives at risk, for fighting to make sure we can live authentically. Pride perpetuates that: We're here to stay.""CTALearn more about how you can develop your own career a Principal.com/careers.Disclosures2922451-052023[1] ACLU[2] US Census[3] Kaiser Family Foundation[4] National Center for Transgender Equality[5] Family EqualityPrincipal Financial Group, Tuesday, June 6, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Principal Financial Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Principal Financial GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/principal-financial-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Principal Financial GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/759607/Supporting-the-LGBTQIA-Community-Its-More-Than-Just-Pride-Month]"

It is also implementing pricing actions to offset cost inflation, especially in raw materials.The company is focusing on cost reductions through restructuring, which is expected to provide benefits in 2023. It expects to realize approximately $50-$70 million in estimated annual savings, 75% of which are expected to be realized by the end of 2023.Moreover, the company remains committed toward expanding its retail operations. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets, as is evident from increasing number of retail stores.Sherwin-Williams is also seeing strength in North American professional architectural end markets. It is witnessing higher architectural sales volumes in the Paint Stores Group segment. Net sales from this segment climbed nearly 15% year over year in the first quarter of 2023 driven by a rise in sales volume in all end markets and higher selling prices. The momentum in this segment is likely to continue in the second quarter on higher architectural demand.The company also has a strong liquidity position and is using its cash strategically. Significant efforts to cut operating costs helped the company to generate strong net cash flows from operations of around $1.9 billion in 2022. The company returned around $1.5 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2022. It also repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock during the most recent quarter.Story continuesDemand Softness AilsThe company sees a challenging demand environment in the second half of 2023. It is witnessing weak demand in new residential and the Consumer Brands Group DIY. Demand has softened in Europe due to the sluggish macroeconomic environment. Moreover, the lack of meaningful recovery in China following the lifting of pandemic-led restrictions is also affecting demand.On the industrial side of the business, SHW is seeing more pressure in North America while Europe and China are yet to fully recover. This is likely to exert pressure on its sales volumes.The slowdown of the U.S. housing market is also hurting Sherwin-Williams’ industrial wood business. Sales in this business fell by mid-single digits in first-quarter 2023, impacted by a slowdown in furniture, cabinetry and flooring related to the weakness in new residential. Revenues from this business are likely to remain under pressure in the second quarter. The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and ConsensusThe Sherwin-Williams Company price-consensus-chart | The Sherwin-Williams Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include L.B.

311,615cc951-cd05-3ae5-9f88-3efecf51e939,FCX,2023-06-07,3 Mining Stocks to Buy for a Commodities Supercycle,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-mining-stocks-buy-commodities-122652522.html,1685536012,STORY,"['MP', 'FCX']","[Investors are right to wonder whether we are on the cusp of another commodities supercycle and how that pertains to mining stocks. We’ve seen massive inflation of late, at levels not reached in four decades. Gas prices spiked not long ago and currently remain high. Lithium prices rocketed as EV firms couldn’t get enough for batteries. And the list goes on. Now, we’re not quite at supercycle levels, which require a combination of surging supply, demand, and prices. But the clean energy boom could create the next commodities supercycle. That means investors should consider commodities and mining companies providing that growth. Let’s look at a few such firms that specialize in nickel, copper, and rare earth metals production, in order to capitalize on that growth. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFCXFreeport McMoRan$34.23NILSYNorilsk Nickel$3.02MPMP Materials$21.11Freeport McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is the world’s largest producer of copper. The firm produced 1.53 million metric tons of copper in 2022, making it the biggest copper miner ahead of other larger firms that also mine copper. Copper is integral to the green energy push for a few important reasons. It’s reliable and it’s efficient. Copper conducts heat and electricity extremely well, which means lower energy losses throughout the process overall. If you’ve ever looked at an electric motor like those found in wind turbines and electric vehicles, you probably have an idea of how much copper is used. In short, these technologies require a lot of copper, meaning demand for this metal should continue to be high as those industries continue to grow. That’s a massive boon to Freeport-McMoRan which produced 965 million pounds of copper and sold 832 million tons in the first quarter. The company also produces significant quantities of gold and molybdenum, which are also vital to key sectors set to benefit from electrification. Story continuesNorilsk Nickel (NILSY)nickel stocks: a piece of nickel ore in front of a white backgroundSource: aura23 / ShutterstockNorilsk Nickel (OTCMKTS:NILSY) is the largest producer of nickel globally. It also happens to be the largest palladium producer as well. Nickel is used in the manufacture of EVs, wind turbines, and nuclear power plants, all of which are important to green energy initiatives. Palladium is used in fuel cells, but is most important in making catalytic converters for vehicles. Currently, the great majority (roughly 69%) of nickel is used to manufacture steel. Nickel adds strength and corrosion resistance at high temperatures. But it has also become increasingly important in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries and renewable energy storage. Nickel-based lithium-ion batteries offer the highest energy density, so nickel will continue to be in demand. Nickel is also required for solid-state batteries that may replace current battery technology in time. Nickel may be the next metal to pop, similar to how lithium has exploded higher. Norilsk Nickel is a safe play for investors looking to capitalize on a future nickel supercycle. MP Materials (MP)Best rare earth stocks: a pile of rare earth metalsSource: Joaquin Corbalan P / ShutterstockMP Materials (NYSE:MP) has the possibility to become one of the most important U.S. companies. It produces rare earth metals that are vital to decarbonizing energy production. Notably, this company is also the only integrated North American rare earth mining and processing firm. MP Materials operates Mountain Pass in Nevada. The site was the primary global source of rare earth metals from the 1960s to the 1990s. China usurped that position, and MP Materials took the site over in 2017.  In 2022, MP Materials produced 15% of all rare earths consumed globally. In 2022, the company recommissioned processing facilities at Mountain Pass. Prior to that, the concentrate mined at the site had to be shipped to Asia for processing. The company’s next step is to manufacture rare earth metals and permanent magnets which will require further manufacturing capacity. The narrative here is crystal clear – MP Materials is a geopolitically-important firm that could become hugely important to U.S. industry and re-shoring efforts. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Union Pacific and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) have reached an agreement that will provide locomotive engineers with up to seven days of paid sick leave.The agreement calls for five days of sick leave, plus the opportunity to convert two additional paid leave days as sick leave, according to UP (NYSE: UNP).The agreement becomes effective Aug. 1. By reaching this agreement with BLET, UP says it has sick leave agreements in place with 12 of its 13 labor unions. This translates into approximately 68% of UP’s craft workforce having sick leave agreements, the railroad said.“This agreement is really about health and safety,” BLET National President Eddie Hall said in a Monday afternoon news release. “It’s not in our members’, the public’s or the railroad’s best interest for engineers to be operating trains when they’re sick. Congratulations to our BLET General Chairmen and Union Pacific’s management who reached this agreement at the bargaining table.”UP President and CEO Lance Fritz said: “The well-being and quality of life for all employees are critically important to us. We want to thank BLET union leadership for their valuable collaboration. This agreement marks another step forward in Union Pacific’s ongoing commitment to fostering a supportive work environment that prioritizes the health and well-being of all employees.”This latest deal comes as UP recently reached another agreement with BLET on work scheduling. The agreement, which was announced in late May and still needs to be ratified by union membership, calls for a schedule that would consist of 11 days on call and four days off. Implementation could take place within a year of ratification.Predictable schedules and sick leave have been key issues for the unions — and particularly for train conductors and locomotive engineers — during the most recent round of collective bargaining between the unions and the Class I railroads. That round was marked by negotiation impasses, as well as the specter of a potential rail strike before Congress intervened last December.Story continuesSubscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inboxClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:UP, train engineers reach ‘historic’ deal addressing work-life balanceNorfolk Southern reaches sick leave agreements with 100% of craft workforceBNSF reaches sick leave agreement with train conductors unionThe post Union Pacific and locomotive engineers ink sick leave deal appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

A positive demography and cost reduction initiatives are the other upsides. Over the past several quarters, the overall soft industry trends leading to a low-volume environment have acted as a dampener for Quest Diagnostics. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, Quest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry. The stock has declined 0.3% compared with 18.3% decline of the industry.Quest Diagnostics reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenues. The base business registered double-digit growth, driven by strong performance across physician and health system lab services. Health plan volumes continued to grow faster than the overall business. This trend is directly related to the company’s ongoing efforts to partner with health plans to actively steer patients to high-quality, lower-cost providers like Quest, thereby saving money for the health plan, employers and plan members.In the first quarter, Quest Diagnostics witnessed success with contract wins in its reference and professional lab services offerings. The company is helping Pennsylvania-based Tower Health manage its laboratory supply chain in addition to performing reference testing.In addition, to help offset inflationary pressure, the company has been pursuing an operational excellence strategy and closely managing the cost structure through its Invigorate initiatives.In terms of Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), the company is optimistic about the recently introduced federal laboratory legislation, Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act (SALSA). The company believes that SALSA has the potential to fix PAMA permanently.On the flip side, in the first quarter of 2023, Quest Diagnostics reported a 10.7% decline in the top line. COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived 80% from the prior-year quarter. The company performed approximately 1.3 million molecular tests in the quarter, down approximately 5 million from the first quarter of 2022. Revenue per requisition declined 7.7% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular volume.Diagnostic information services revenues declined 11.1% from the prior year, reflecting lower year-over-year revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3.3% in the quarter under review. The adjusted operating margin contracted 644 basis points year over year.Story continuesFurther, pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 3.8% year over year in the first quarter. Revenues per requisition declined 7.7% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volume.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Penumbra PEN, Lantheus LNTH and Neuronetics STIM.

Per Option Care’s management, Option Care and Amedisys as a combined company will be well-positioned to meet the growing demand for personalized care in the home and alternative sites. The announcement that the companies have entered into the definitive merger agreement was made on May 3.This infusion and home care services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Revenues are expected to be $1.06 billion, up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Option Care, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$17.3bUS$17.3bUS$18.3bUS$18.6bUS$19.5bUS$20.1bUS$20.7bUS$21.3bUS$21.8bUS$22.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.93%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$16.0kUS$14.7kUS$14.5kUS$13.5kUS$13.1kUS$12.5kUS$11.9kUS$11.3kUS$10.7kUS$10.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$129bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$374bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$374b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$170bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$298b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$49.8, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.027. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

""Later this year, iPhone, iPad, and Mac will have native support for network relays. Together with Cisco Secure Access, enterprises will have a secure and seamless remote access solution, to do their best work from anywhere, on the best devices for business.""Cisco Secure Access is taking a hybrid Points of Presence (POP) approach with Cisco Data Centers and public cloud providers to rapidly extend global reach for our customers. As part of the Cisco Security Cloud, it leverages capabilities from the rest of the Cisco security and networking portfolio, including embedded network visibility from Cisco ThousandEyes, and can be easily integrated with solutions from third-party vendors. Cisco Secure Access will be in limited availability starting in July 2023 and will be Generally Available in October 2023.""Organizations are deploying SSE for a variety of reasons, but improving security outcomes is arguably at the top of the list. Achieving this requires an emphasis on users to create a frictionless experience and simplifying security team processes to improve efficiency and ensure consistency,"" said John Grady, Principal Analyst Enterprise Strategy Group. ""Security teams making plans for SSE should prioritize integrated solutions that focus on simplicity, scale, and user experience.""""At WWT our goal is to provide security solutions and services that help our customers achieve their business goals. As a Cisco partner, we are really excited about the direction Cisco is taking with the launch of their Cisco Secure Access solution,"" said Neil Anderson, Area Vice President, Cloud &amp; Infrastructure Solutions at WWT. ""With Cisco Secure Access our customers gain a simplified way of accessing both private, cloud, and SaaS applications private and internet resources, while transparently securing against threats and boosting user productivity while reducing frustration.""Generative AI to Improve Threat Response &amp; Simplify Security Policy ManagementFurther delivering on its strategic vision, Cisco is previewing the first generative AI capabilities in the Security Cloud. Today, most organizations have a patchwork of security products, forcing teams to set and maintain extremely complex security policies as well as track and remediate threats across numerous solutions.Reduce Policy Complexity: The Cisco Security Cloud will leverage a generative AI-powered Policy Assistant that enables Security and IT administrators to describe granular security policies and evaluate how to best implement them across different aspects of their security infrastructure. For the first implementation, customers will be able to reason with Cisco's AI Assistant to evaluate and produce more efficient firewall policies. It will leverage customers' existing rulesets in Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center to drive unmatched efficiency without sacrificing granular control and will be available later this year.Quickly Detect and Remediate Threats: Cisco's SOC Assistant will support the Security Operations Center (SOC) to detect and respond to threats faster. When an incident occurs, the assistant will contextualize events across email, the web, endpoints, and the network to tell the SOC analyst exactly what happened and the impact. Analysts can then interact and reason with the assistant to determine the best remediation approach leveraging an extensive knowledgebase of potential actions while also taking into account the analysts input. Cisco first shared the concept at RSA Conference 2023 and is excited to share that the event summarization feature will be available by the end of calendar 2023 with the remaining capabilities in the first half of calendar 2024.Network Security Bolstered for Hybrid WorkThe world is hybrid, and users require seamless connected experiences at the office and on the road.As the demands of the firewall as the foundation of the security stack continue to expand, the new Cisco Secure Firewall 4200 Series raises the bar for performance and flexibility with cryptographic acceleration, clustering and modularity.Running the new 7.4 version of the operating system, Secure Firewall 4200 features:AI and ML-based encrypted threat blocking without decryption.An evolution of Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) with complete threat inspection and policy for each individual application.Simplified branch routing that brings security, control, and visibility to traffic from remote offices to applications in hybrid datacenters.Cisco Secure Firewall 4200 Series appliance will be generally available in September 2023 supporting the 7.4 version of operating system. The 7.4 OS will be generally available for the rest of the Secure Firewall appliance family in December 2023.Cisco is also proud to announce Cisco Multicloud Defense following its recent acquisition of Valtix. Multicloud Defense extends the traditional firewall concept into a service-oriented, multicloud world.   SecOps teams can now manage security across AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI with a single policy, in real-time, from a single SaaS platform. In addition, teams can rapidly spin up security for any cloud environment, leading to increased security and efficiency. Cisco Multicloud Defense is available today.Cloud Application SecurityCisco is delivering an integrated approach to secure cloud native applications from code to cloud with new capabilities in Panoptica, Cisco's cloud native application security solution. Adding to the Cloud Workload Protection (CWPP) that Panoptica currently provides, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) will be available starting Fall 2023 to deliver continuous cloud security compliance and monitoring at scale, giving customers visibility into their entire inventory of cloud assets, including Kubernetes clusters. In addition, a new attack path engine that uses graph-based technology to deliver advanced attack path analysis will help security teams quickly identify and remediate potential risks across cloud infrastructures. Further, Panoptica's integration with Cisco's Full Stack Observability portfolio provides real-time visibility to prioritize business risks. These integrated capabilities will help security and developer teams alike gain the visibility, control and actionable intelligence required to protect dynamic cloud applications and infrastructure.To learn more, visit Cisco.com/go/security.Additional Resources:Blog: Introducing Cisco Secure AccessBlog: Going Beyond Next-Generation Network Security: Cisco's Platform ApproachBlog: Cisco Announces its Latest Cloud Native Application Security Strategy with PanopticaAbout Cisco Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

Word on the street is that it was a huge success, but today I'm checking in with event organizers Tanisha Gordon-Flowers, Sr. Manager, Strategic Alliances, Cisco Capital, Ronnell Nobles, Sr. Manager, Diverse Partner Investments, Andrico Spates, Senior Manager, Global Partner Sales and Business Development, and Bryan Wiggins, Leader, Supplier Diversity, to learn more about how it went.What were you trying to achieve with this event?Tanisha: The intent of the conference is really to bring our black owned businesses together as a community to network, share best practices, and provide information to help strengthen their businesses.Andrico: It was about empowering them to excel with Cisco and beyond. To strengthen their businesses and expose them to what's possible. Not just with Cisco, but also with each other, which is something that came out of the conference.""The intent of the conference is really to bring our black owned businesses together as a community to network, share best practices, and provide information to help strengthen their businesses."" - Tanisha Gordon FlowersDid it meet your expectations?Tanisha: I thought it was really exciting to watch the participants interact with each other. They were so engaged. I loved when we were in the federal session, and they were banding together as one voice to communicate some of the challenges they were encountering while working in the federal space. They voiced opinions on their experiences and shared best practices. So, I loved seeing that interaction. That was the vision I had. That they would have a space that made them feel comfortable enough to be transparent and to express themselves freely.Ronnell: I'll also say that part of this was to show the Cisco commitment to the Black-owned business community. This was really the first time Cisco put together an event of this magnitude just focused on this community. We brought in our executives, we brought in outside speakers, and we focused on the content that was relevant to this audience. So just getting it done the first time was a win. But it's really the follow up conversations and actions that come out of it that will be the true measure of success.Story continuesBryan: I want to piggyback off one thing that Tanisha said-about the attendees coming together. I wasn't sure how it was going to work with the incumbent suppliers and aspiring suppliers. And the way that our incumbents sort of embraced and reinforced our message was really great. They were explaining the programs we have to support suppliers, sharing their experiences with them, and encouraging the other businesses to get involved. I was surprised and impressed.Andrico: The speakers at the event talked a lot about empowerment and excelling. And I think when it comes to the empowerment piece we landed that plane successfully. Now we're all looking forward to how we will support their success as they move into the future.What was the most surprising thing about the event?Tanisha: I was surprised by just how quickly everyone embraced each other. You would never know that these people just met the evening before at the networking event or that morning. I introduced one of our finance partners to one of our channel partners the morning of the conference and it turned out they had met during the networking event the night before and already had an inside joke running like they were old friends.Ronnell: I will say one other thing that I thought was pretty cool was that the partners we've been working with for a while were really advocates for us, throughout. They had taken a degree of ownership of this thing and they were helping some of the newer partners understand best practices and benefits of working with Cisco.What do you envision for next year? Is this going to happen again?Tanisha: Absolutely. I think that not only will we have continued support from our executive team, but after hearing about this year's event we'll have many more partners or aspiring partners and suppliers who will want to participate next year.Andrico: I'm hoping we can look at the actions that have been taken between the first conference and the next one. I'd love to see the companies that attended share their achievements so other companies can emulate their success. Our closing speaker emphasized ""Empowerment to Action."" We will continue with the empowerment piece, but also celebrate and evaluate the action component.Bryan: We may wind up having a beginner track next year, because there are more Black-owned businesses that need to receive empowerment messaging and tools.Andrico: I agree. It would be great to put our partners and suppliers in the forefront of the community. It would be more impactful for the alumni to be running sessions and telling the story.Tanisha: It was nice to see some of the more experienced partners become mentors in a way to some of the other partners. So, maybe the partners who came this year can be mentors for the next round of folks coming in.Ronnell: I completely agree. I definitely think there was more partnering than competition at this event-even though a lot of these companies are competing in the same spaces.""It was nice to see some of the more experienced partners become mentors in a way to some of the other partners."" - Tanisha Gordon FlowersAny final thoughts?Bryan: Yes. I just want to thank all the people who helped make this happen but didn't get credit because they weren't standing on the stage like we were. The video team, the caterers, the people managing registration. They were almost all from diverse-owned companies and they brought so much value. It takes so many moving parts to put on an event like that and they are the ones who made it happen.View original content here.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, June 6, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/759535/Cisco-Hosts-First-Ever-Black-Owned-Partners-and-Suppliers-Conference-in-Atlanta]"
